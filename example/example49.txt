If you’ve spent much time around any youth sports—from baseball to soccer to junior rodeo—you’ve seen it: Parents wanting their child to win more than that child does.
While that dilemma is problematic in any pursuit, in equine sports, it can be flat dangerous.
“For one, everybody wants to win,” Casey Branquinho, our SafeStart expert and California cow-horse trainer, said. “I see parents over-mount their young kids because they want to be competitive, and the kid is hanging on for dear life with the horse just doing whatever it does.

If a kid is intimidated by a horse, then it’s too much horse. In every situation, the kid should be able to pull the horse to a s

------------answer-----------------------
r of social organization and is characterized by a transition from state-created money to bank-created money.
Think about that for a moment. Capitalism is about bank-created money! For thousands of years, the state, for better or worse, controlled three monetary prerogatives discussed above. The state created money by spending it into existence and guaranteed its value by levying taxes in the unit of account in which it spent. Beginning around the twelfth century, however, states began to expand beyond what their power to tax could justify and so they asked private merchants for loans. (See Brown 2013, p.111, and Davies 2002, p.261.) Slowly but surely, states lost the majority of their power to create money and the seigniorage benefit that came with that creation. States only kept the power to determine the unit of account. But with that power came the responsibility to manage the stability of the unit of account.
There has been precious little discussion on ending or reigning in the commercial banking industry’s money-creation power.
It is this strange conflict of interest with which this paper is most concerned. The state is forced to ensure a stable dollar, but it isn’t able to determine how—or for what—dollars enter society. So while much of the discussion surrounding the Green New Deal concerns ending or reigning in capitalism, there has been precious little discussion on ending or reigning in the commercial banking industry’s money-creation power.
While capitalism is often thought of as the private accumulation of surplus, the manner in which that accumulation is enabled is often ignored. Commercially created money means that production surpluses remain within the private sector. Were the state to take back the power to create money, and the seigniorage benefit that comes with such creation, it would severely limit the extent to which the private sector could accumulate surplus. In fact, nationalizing money creation would align the right of the state to create money with the responsibility it bears to manage money’s stability.
Perhaps most importantly, by regaining the monetary prerogative, the state could influence the direction of the economy by spending and lending money into existence in accordance with its goals. In the case of the Green New Deal, these goals would be social justice and environmental sustainability. This would mean that the tenets of the Green New Deal—from healthcare and education to healthy food and sustainable energy—would become structural components of a just and sustainable economy and not simply regulatory mechanisms of an extractive capitalism.
The Green New Deal, as currently written, is an end-of-pipe regulatory framework that relies upon taxing bank-created money to finance social and environmental spending.
This is a huge difference! By avoiding a discussion of a nationalized money supply, the Green New Deal, as currently written, is an end-of-pipe regulatory framework that relies upon taxing bank-created money to finance social and environmental spending. A nationalized money supply would transform government spending into the monetary creation mechanism and embed justice and sustainability as hallmarks of how we manage our national economy.

In Drosophila, distinct mechanisms orient asymmetric cell division along the apical-basal axis in neuroblasts and along the anterior-posterior axis in sensory organ precursor (SOP) cells. Here, we show that heterotrimeric G proteins are essential for asymmetric cell division in both cell types.

What types of service projects did Juniata College students participate in during their spring break

Juniata Students Seek Out Alternative Spring Break Service Trips
(Posted March 24, 2003)
HUNTINGDON, Pa. -- While many college students this year frolicked in such spring-break havens as Daytona Beach, San Padre Island and Virginia Beach, several groups of students from Juniata College found fun in the sun by performing a variety of service projects in Georgia, North Carolina and Guatemala.
An international trip led by Henry Thurston-Griswold, professor of Spanish at Juniata, and Kelly Turlish, coordinator of community service/service learning at the college, took a group of 15 Juniata students to Guatemala over spring break.
The group met with 10 nongovernmental and community-based organizations that are working in such areas as human rights, education and sustainable development. "The students were able to see international development at the ground level," Turlish says. "Our hope is that the students will return and compare their experience to their lives in the United States, and then help educate others to create change here and abroad."
The students spent three days as volunteers at Colegio Miguel Angel Asturias, a private school for low-income students located in the city of Quetzaltenango. While at the school, they installed and networked three donated computers. In addition the Juniata students taught English as a Foreign Language classes, conducted science experiments and offered other activities for the children.
"Going to the plantaion made me question what my basic needs really are," says Katie O'Donnell., a junior from Royersford, Pa. "I saw very many horrible situations, things that I never wanted to think about or see. Yet, at the same time, we recognized the efforts of great human rights organizations and very inspiring people who give hope to the Guatemalan situation."
The group also visited San Basilio plantation, where the group met with the regional leader of the Southern Coast for the Community of Peasant Unity, an organization that helps peasants obtain legal rights to land. "We learned a great deal about Guatemala's current conditions and its history, which makes you appreciate how well the government of the United States works," Turlish says.

How do defects in G protein complexes affect spindle orientation and asymmetric cell divisions
------------correct----------------------
ic G protein complexes causes defects in spindle orientation and asymmetric localization of determinants. Gαi is colocalized and associated with Pins, a protein that induces the release of the βγ subunit and might act as a receptor-independent G protein activator. Thus, asymmetric activation of heterotrimeric G proteins by a receptor-independent mechanism may orient asymmetric cell divisions in different cell types.

Why is regular sewer line cleaning important for maintaining property value
------------correct----------------------
g in increased energy consumption and decreased efficiency. You can prevent the buildup of materials that cause pipe blockages by scheduling regular sewer line cleaning services with a professional plumber. Professional cleaning methods like hydro jetting and mechanical augering can effectively remove stubborn clogs in sewer pipes, restoring the system’s efficiency. With improved wastewater flow, your sewer system consumes less energy, resulting in reduced utility bills.
Preserving Property Value
When it comes to maintaining the value of a property, most homeowners focus on visible aspects like landscaping, interior renovations, or curb appeal. However, regular sewer line cleaning is equally crucial in preserving property value and attracting potential buyers or tenants. A well-maintained sewer system ensures the functionality and efficiency of your property’s plumbing infrastructure. Potential buyers or tenants consider the condition of the sewer system when evaluating a property. A clean and properly functioning sewer system eliminates the risk of unpleasant odors, backups, or slow drainage, which can deter potential buyers.
Compliance With Regulations
Many jurisdictions have specific requirements and environmental standards that ensure sewer systems operate properly without causing damage to the environment and the general public. Sewer systems that are neglected or poorly maintained can contribute to water contamination, the spread of diseases, and environmental degradation. Scheduling regular sewer line cleaning services helps mitigate these risks by preventing blockages, backups, and sewage spills that can lead to contamination. By meeting regulatory requirements, you can help maintain a clean and healthy environment and avoid penalties, fines, and legal consequences resulting from non-compliance.

Returning home from the G1 Summit, I felt a little languid because of a lack of sleep. I felt uncomfortable in the stomach, too, because I had consumed a little too much alcohol. But a pleasant sense of emptiness filled my heart in the wake of my release from the extreme tension. In a state of dim consciousness after the feast, I viewed countless tweets that appeared under the “#G1summit” hash tag on my Twitter site. They reminded me of each and every scene at the G1 Summit, the faces of those who took the platform, and thoughts that crossed the minds of people who attended this gathering.
Preparing for the G1 Summit while running my main business demanded an effort that far and away exceeded my expectations. I made preparations for this years’ G1 Summit with a strong desire to make all sessions there better than their counterparts at Davos. The third G1 Summit was a major success, thanks to a large number of people who chose to get involved, including presenters, other participants, board members, sponsors, and Hoshino Resort. I would like thank these many supporters and in a loud voice declare this gathering a success.
I decided to look back on things that the impressed me, and write about them in random order in this column, keeping my head as cool as possible while enjoying the sustained sense of exaltation the event gave me.
1) Listening to speeches and discussions at this year’s G1 Summit sessions on finance, foreign relations, national defense, social welfare, and regional Japan, I realized Japan was in a serious situation, far more than I had previously understood. Yoshiko Sakurai used the word, “120 million irresponsible people,” to describe the present state. I felt strongly Japanese people must take resolute actions from now on.
Kazuhiko Toyama from the Industrial Growth Platform talked about a “test of endurance.” Continuous public statements and actions change current when their supporters exceed 50% of total population. A current always changes its course when leaders make steady arguments and take firm actions. Endurance is necessary, though.
2) In the meantime, I’m ashamed to admit I had only thought of myself as a “next-generation leader” up to this year’s G1 Summit. I strongly felt the need to recognize that G1 Summit participants are already in a position to lead reforms in Japan.
This strong feeling arose in my heart through the course of a dialogue I had with G1 Summit participants in their 20s and 30s. Their earnest wish reminded me strongly the need for us to stand up and take actions now. In fact, some of my friends in politics are already at the center of the Japanese government. Other friends who chose political careers occupy the position of prefectural governors now. The era in which we must take responsibility for Japan’s future has already arrived.
3) I opened the G1 Summit to reports on the Twitter and in blogs, starting from this year. I could feel this step gave tens of thousands of Twitter users a chance to take part in this meeting and exchange their opinions, along with the 180 people who attended the event live. I felt connected with them in the same way as I feel connected to those of you who are reading this column as an email or blog entry now. I introduced the tweets made by some of the followers at the closing session. The sense of empathy many people had expressed made me truly glad.
We insisted on doing things in secrecy so that we could devote the G1 Summit to efforts to build a core G1 community on the first two occasions. From this year, we made the details of this gathering accessible to the public in principle in a bid to expand the community beyond 180 live participants. I’m planning to open certain G1 Summit sessions to reports through Niko Niko Douga and USTREAM video-sharing services next year. My policy is to make the meeting more accessible.
I kept tweeting throughout the G1 Summit term, finding time between my jobs managing programs, welcoming and sending off guests, and paying courtesy visits to all presenters. I could connect with many people through the tweets I had made. I had a gut feeling that my tweets produced a “forum for expressing sympathy” in cyberspace.
4) Further, the G1 Summit was a sharp reminder that Japan has brilliant intellectuals and leaders. Three intellectual giants, namely, Ikujiro Nonaka, Seigo Matsuoka, and Hiroshi Tasaka, impressed me with their wisdom and thoughts. Yoshiko Sakurai shared her soul-stirring words. And political and business leaders among the participants displayed high levels of awareness and knowledge. Those speakers demonstrated a higher quality than their counterparts at Davos.
So why are things not going well in Japan? Things are not going well because the communication needed to generate followers has been impossible for leaders in different fields, in the absence of a place where they can exchange their opinions informally. Things are not going smoothly because a place that Nonaka calls a forum for expressing sympathy has not been established. But things will be alright from this point. There will be no need for worry, because the G1 Summit and direct media, such as Twitter and blogs, will play the role of a forum for expressing empathy.
5) Lastly, I realized Japan has many values that should be cherished, in addition to its brilliant intellectuals and leaders. I kept thinking about “things to pass down, things to change, and things to create anew” as I listened to sessions at this year’s G1 Summit. “Things to pass down and things to change” were easy to imagine. But I could not find “things to create anew.” I couldn’t find such things probably because all the factors needed for the future had been assembled at the meeting already.
On this point, one thought occurred to me suddenly. They may be “things that should be brought back anew,” instead of “things to create anew.” It was a point all three intellectual giants and Yoshiko Sakurai maintained in a consistent manner.

How to find your router's IP Address
The easiest way to locate your router's IP address is to run our free Router Detector utility. It's a part of the Network Utilities suite of tools and it's completely free to use.
How To Forward Ports
A smart way to forward your ports is to use Network Utilities. Since Network Utilities allows you to both forward and un-forward ports easily you can keep your network security maximized, and then forward ports only when you need them. Alternatively you can do it by hand.
The process for forwarding a port is generally:
- Open a web browser and navigate to your router's IP address.
- Locate your routers port forwarding section.
- Put the IP address of your computer or gaming console in the appropriate box in your router.
- Put the TCP and UDP ports for your game in the corresponding boxes in your router.
- Intermittently you have to reboot your router for the changes to take effect.

g in increased energy consumption and decreased efficiency. You can prevent the buildup of materials that cause pipe blockages by scheduling regular sewer line cleaning services with a professional plumber. Professional cleaning methods like hydro jetting and mechanical augering can effectively remove stubborn clogs in sewer pipes, restoring the system’s efficiency. With improved wastewater flow, your sewer system consumes less energy, resulting in reduced utility bills.
Preserving Property Value
When it comes to maintaining the value of a property, most homeowners focus on visible aspects like landscaping, interior renovations, or curb appeal. However, regular sewer line cleaning is equally crucial in preserving property value and attracting potential buyers or tenants. A well-maintained sewer system ensures the functionality and efficiency of your property’s plumbing infrastructure. Potential buyers or tenants consider the condition of the sewer system when evaluating a property. A clean and properly functioning sewer system eliminates the risk of unpleasant odors, backups, or slow drainage, which can deter potential buyers.
Compliance With Regulations
Many jurisdictions have specific requirements and environmental standards that ensure sewer systems operate properly without causing damage to the environment and the general public. Sewer systems that are neglected or poorly maintained can contribute to water contamination, the spread of diseases, and environmental degradation. Scheduling regular sewer line cleaning services helps mitigate these risks by preventing blockages, backups, and sewage spills that can lead to contamination. By meeting regulatory requirements, you can help maintain a clean and healthy environment and avoid penalties, fines, and legal consequences resulting from non-compliance.

What type of supplemental services does the PETI school provide for children in the favela
------------correct----------------------
e church looking for help.
We can see this sign from the veranda, over the highway. This church building is right on the corner of two very busy streets, which is wonderful in so many ways.
Last Wednesday Gilberto came. Fabio wrote about him in the last post. Since then, others have come. Today, the man that “lives” next door came. There is a little plot of land on the other side of the church and there is a homeless man living there. We have been praying for him, and today he showed up here! Fabio and Claudio talked to him, gave him some food, and the guy invited Fabio to come visit him there in his cardboard shack! Fabio plans to go tomorrow.
Fabio is really excited to see God doing this work and to be a part of it. It is exciting for me too, and I love seeing how Fabio is coming alive as he fulfills what God is calling him to. He shows so much love and care to these guys that come in here, and you can see how much it touches them. No one else wants to touch them! Fabio says he doesnt mind the smell of alcohol too much, but is still asking for grace to withstand the strong smell of urine when he hugs them…. :-/
And hold back those stumbling to the slaughter.” -Proverbs 24:11
This is also part of our view from the veranda, and a target for prayer. This castle-looking building is the transvestite theatre I mentioned earlier. We now know it is all of that and more… We are praying for the devil’s work in this place to FALL; that the place would close down for lack of business, because those who frequent it now will come to know JESUS who will set them free from slavery to sin!! I personally am shocked at the change in my own heart, that can only be from the Lord. Previously, I was just repulsed by this particular variety of sin, but now I find myself being drawn to these people, our transvestite neighbors particularly, full of compassion for them as they are lost and dying without Jesus.
A MORNING OFF
This morning we had our first morning off since we came here, and a guy from the church picked us up and took us to the beach. It was really nice! Although not very far away from where we are living, it seems like a different world. It is, really. That is where the rich live, and there are high rise apartments lining the beach front. It is a growing area, with many building still going up and the city expanding on both sides of the beach front. There are a lot of foreigners investing here, because the real estate value is increasing by 20-30% every year! And there is still alot of undeveloped area both to the north and south, all along the beautiful and mountainous beaches.
THE PETI SCHOOL
I am teaching English now at the Peti school on Friday afternoons and on Monday mornings, for two hours each day. My first class is of 7-10 year olds, and the second class is of 11-14 year olds. I have enjoyed the teaching and the children, and getting to talk to another teacher and the director. I am also able to take my kids with me, and I have been taking Joshua and Dominique, one at a time. It is a great opportunity for them to learn about a lot of things – with me right by their side to guide the learning process.
This school is not the “main” school for the children. The way school works here in Brazil, there are two shifts at school: 7am-noon and 1pm to 6pm. It may vary somewhat by school, but that is the basic schedule, and you can choose whether you want to send your children in the morning or the afternoon. Well, in the favela, during the hours that the children are not in school, they are on the streets and generally up to no good. Most of them have homes, but not very good ones. They are typically neglected and/or abused and would rather spend their time on the streets than at home. Most of their parents are drug users, drinkers, prostitutes, you name it. This is the favela:
The land in the favela is not bought. The people who live here are squatters that just try to build some kind of house with whatever materials they can find. They just build houses on top of houses at the edge of the city, into the mountain. Because these houses are without structure or foundation, they are not uncommonly washed away in landslides when it rains a lot.
So, the PETI school is a supplementary school for the children to go to during the hours they are not in school, to keep them off the streets. They can eat there, have recess, art classes and other “fun” stuff, and also receive help with their homework. Twice a week they even get surfing classes! Much of the help is volunteer.
I am praying about how these classes can get me INTO the favela – into their homes, their families, their lives. Teaching English is great, but if it stops there, what good am I really doing for them? What difference will it really make in their future?
In one of my classes, there are two boys that have declared themselves to be homosexuals – at ELEVEN years old!! There are several that are HIV positive, some have been picked up by the cops for drug usage – at seven and eight years old, and one of the girls is constantly offering herself to the boys. The teacher even saw her do the same to some men at a bar next door! She is ten years old and still has the body of a little girl. Imagine what her mother does for a living, and what she has seen at home, and cry with me. Better yet, cry out to the Lord for these children!
GUILHERME’S FLIP FLOPS
Remember our neighbor boy Guilherme from the last post? The day I took the picture of his flip-flop, he ended up forgetting them here. Joshua saw how thin they were, torn in the back, and the strap had broken and been repaired from the underneath. Joshua asked Fabio if there was some extra work he could do to earn some money to buy Guilherme a new pair of flip-flops. So, Fabio gave him some extra work, and he worked hard at it.
The next day we took him to the store and he used his hard-earned money to buy a new pair of flip-flops for Guilherme, the exact same style as his own flip-flops! Guilherme was so happy!!
One day I got home and went into the community kitchen downstairs and Guilherme was there. His face LIT UP when I walked into the room. Then he started singing (in Portuguese): “Singing, singing, singing to my Jesus! I threw away my sadness and sent it away from my heart!” I was impressed and asked him where he had learned that song? He said Joshua taught it to him. 🙂 They have been singing it together ever since. Joshua is taking seriously his position as a missionary and we are so thankful to see that. Here he is reading a book to Guilherme:
I know this is a long-mega-post – thanks for hanging in there with us! There is just so much going on here that I want to share with you all. Keep praying for us and thank you for your care and concern for us and the ministry here! We love you!

ic G protein complexes causes defects in spindle orientation and asymmetric localization of determinants. Gαi is colocalized and associated with Pins, a protein that induces the release of the βγ subunit and might act as a receptor-independent G protein activator. Thus, asymmetric activation of heterotrimeric G proteins by a receptor-independent mechanism may orient asymmetric cell divisions in different cell types.

to direct the synthesis of viral proteins. The critical viral proteins that the messenger RNA must encode are those that coat the genome and those that help replicate the genome. One of the great surprises of modern virology has been the discovery of the variety of genetic systems that viruses have evolved to satisfy their needs. Among the animal viruses, at least 6 totally different solutions to the basic requirements of a virus have been found.

------------question-----------------------
What realization did the author have about Japan's leadership after attending the G1 Summit
------------correct----------------------
Returning home from the G1 Summit, I felt a little languid because of a lack of sleep. I felt uncomfortable in the stomach, too, because I had consumed a little too much alcohol. But a pleasant sense of emptiness filled my heart in the wake of my release from the extreme tension. In a state of dim consciousness after the feast, I viewed countless tweets that appeared under the “#G1summit” hash tag on my Twitter site. They reminded me of each and every scene at the G1 Summit, the faces of those who took the platform, and thoughts that crossed the minds of people who attended this gathering.
Preparing for the G1 Summit while running my main business demanded an effort that far and away exceeded my expectations. I made preparations for this years’ G1 Summit with a strong desire to make all sessions there better than their counterparts at Davos. The third G1 Summit was a major success, thanks to a large number of people who chose to get involved, including presenters, other participants, board members, sponsors, and Hoshino Resort. I would like thank these many supporters and in a loud voice declare this gathering a success.
I decided to look back on things that the impressed me, and write about them in random order in this column, keeping my head as cool as possible while enjoying the sustained sense of exaltation the event gave me.
1) Listening to speeches and discussions at this year’s G1 Summit sessions on finance, foreign relations, national defense, social welfare, and regional Japan, I realized Japan was in a serious situation, far more than I had previously understood. Yoshiko Sakurai used the word, “120 million irresponsible people,” to describe the present state. I felt strongly Japanese people must take resolute actions from now on.
Kazuhiko Toyama from the Industrial Growth Platform talked about a “test of endurance.” Continuous public statements and actions change current when their supporters exceed 50% of total population. A current always changes its course when leaders make steady arguments and take firm actions. Endurance is necessary, though.
2) In the meantime, I’m ashamed to admit I had only thought of myself as a “next-generation leader” up to this year’s G1 Summit. I strongly felt the need to recognize that G1 Summit participants are already in a position to lead reforms in Japan.
This strong feeling arose in my heart through the course of a dialogue I had with G1 Summit participants in their 20s and 30s. Their earnest wish reminded me strongly the need for us to stand up and take actions now. In fact, some of my friends in politics are already at the center of the Japanese government. Other friends who chose political careers occupy the position of prefectural governors now. The era in which we must take responsibility for Japan’s future has already arrived.
3) I opened the G1 Summit to reports on the Twitter and in blogs, starting from this year. I could feel this step gave tens of thousands of Twitter users a chance to take part in this meeting and exchange their opinions, along with the 180 people who attended the event live. I felt connected with them in the same way as I feel connected to those of you who are reading this column as an email or blog entry now. I introduced the tweets made by some of the followers at the closing session. The sense of empathy many people had expressed made me truly glad.
We insisted on doing things in secrecy so that we could devote the G1 Summit to efforts to build a core G1 community on the first two occasions. From this year, we made the details of this gathering accessible to the public in principle in a bid to expand the community beyond 180 live participants. I’m planning to open certain G1 Summit sessions to reports through Niko Niko Douga and USTREAM video-sharing services next year. My policy is to make the meeting more accessible.
I kept tweeting throughout the G1 Summit term, finding time between my jobs managing programs, welcoming and sending off guests, and paying courtesy visits to all presenters. I could connect with many people through the tweets I had made. I had a gut feeling that my tweets produced a “forum for expressing sympathy” in cyberspace.
4) Further, the G1 Summit was a sharp reminder that Japan has brilliant intellectuals and leaders. Three intellectual giants, namely, Ikujiro Nonaka, Seigo Matsuoka, and Hiroshi Tasaka, impressed me with their wisdom and thoughts. Yoshiko Sakurai shared her soul-stirring words. And political and business leaders among the participants displayed high levels of awareness and knowledge. Those speakers demonstrated a higher quality than their counterparts at Davos.
So why are things not going well in Japan? Things are not going well because the communication needed to generate followers has been impossible for leaders in different fields, in the absence of a place where they can exchange their opinions informally. Things are not going smoothly because a place that Nonaka calls a forum for expressing sympathy has not been established. But things will be alright from this point. There will be no need for worry, because the G1 Summit and direct media, such as Twitter and blogs, will play the role of a forum for expressing empathy.
5) Lastly, I realized Japan has many values that should be cherished, in addition to its brilliant intellectuals and leaders. I kept thinking about “things to pass down, things to change, and things to create anew” as I listened to sessions at this year’s G1 Summit. “Things to pass down and things to change” were easy to imagine. But I could not find “things to create anew.” I couldn’t find such things probably because all the factors needed for the future had been assembled at the meeting already.
On this point, one thought occurred to me suddenly. They may be “things that should be brought back anew,” instead of “things to create anew.” It was a point all three intellectual giants and Yoshiko Sakurai maintained in a consistent manner.

rders and workflow functions for Google Ad campaigns. “It streamlines the system,” said McNutt, “We used it before, but not as diligently.”
Reporting: More important than ever before
For McNutt, reporting has become a priority — making sure both team members and company stakeholders are aware of how campaigns are performing and the data being collected. He says an important factor that has now come into play is data-integration capabilities across the platforms they are using.
“The ability to centralize data into one place helps our team work more efficiently. This also helps us better manage our resources in terms of the footprint of our marketing stack,” said McNutt, “We try to optimize solutions and tools that work together and leverage the data they already provide so we can avoid building out a huge CDP.”
He says some data integration capabilities may not go as deep as a point solution would be able to go, but they definitely get the job done. The challenge now is being able to unify large volumes of data and make it functional.
“We’re looking at ways we can automate manual tasks and evaluating manual processes for improvement so we can extract the most value from current investments and resources.”
Instead of building out stacks, the new rule of thumb is efficiency: Consolidating platforms and taking full advantage of available integrations and add-ons for your existing marketing tools. That also means reaching out to your current list of vendors to find out if there are any features being offered free of charge or at a discounted rate during the coming months. McNutt said he’s currently giving TapClicks own tool away to existing customers for the next three to six months.

How does the Green New Deal view money, and what role does the government play in managing the monetary system
------------correct----------------------
by Joe Ament
The Green New Deal is perhaps the most audacious plan to ever seriously address the grave social and environmental challenges we face. By identifying “systemic injustice,” the plan is sweeping in its scope. Yet, while the plan discusses public banks in a reference to adequate capital, the plan fails to see the commercial banking sector as one of the structural causes of, and impediments to solving, the problems we face. Importantly, the Green New Deal fails to articulate exactly why a nationalized banking system is critical to the success of the programs its proposes.
Money is created in modern economies when commercial banks extend interest-bearing loans to individuals and corporations. The money in those loans does not exist before the loan is generated but is created when the bank marks up the borrower’s checking account. This is in stark contrast to the general notion that money is a finite resource, such as gold, that is allocated to its best economic use by the Central Bank.
When money is created by the private sector in the manner discussed above, it is seen as a private resource. Accordingly, public use of money for government spending is viewed as wasteful expenditure rather than productive investment. In the case of the Green New Deal, the massive price tag is seen as cannibalizing the productive private sector. It is for this reason that opponents of the Green New Deal argue that it will hurt the economy, and its proponents argue to “finance” the plan by moving money from one sector to another, e.g. from Wall Street to Main Street.
Money is a social relation. It is an abstract measure of what we all owe to one another.
Money, however, is not a private resource. And it is not a finite commodity. Money is a social relation. It is an abstract measure of what we all owe to one another. Think of it as a tally of everything you owe and are owed, for all the work you do and all the purchases you make. Now extrapolate that to the whole country, let the government manage it—just like it does with laws and other contracts—and you’ve got a monetary system!
The role of the government is crucial in managing the money system. Since money is a social relation, the government is responsible for the money system. Think of what happened in the Great Depression, the Savings and Loan crisis, and the 2008 Financial Crisis: the government always stepped in to repair the money system. And as guarantor of the social relation, it always will.
Monetary theorists understand the government’s monetary prerogative in three ways. First is the government’s ability to choose the unit of account that is used in the country—dollars in the United States and Canada. Second is the government’s ability to issue those units of account into circulation. Third is the benefit of first use that comes with issuing money. This last right is called seigniorage and can be thought of as the profit of creating money above the cost of printing and distributing that money.
Money has existed as a state-managed tally of owing and being owed (of credits and debts in theoretical parlance) for thousands of years. In fact, a lot of evidence suggests that such monetary systems existed for thousands of years before coins and markets—and might even be the reason humans began to settle in the first place!

What is the purpose of the proceeds from The Giving Gig 2018 event
------------correct----------------------
The Giving Gig | Community Health Network
The Beauty Lounge has been named again as the official beauty salon and med spa of The Giving Gig 2018.
If you think chemo, radiation and surgery are effective fighting cancer, imagine Earth, Wind & Fire. The iconic, seventh top-selling musical group will headline The Giving Gig 2018 after more than 1,000 donors gather to support Community’s cancer fighters.
Proceeds from the event will benefit Community Health Network’s Oncology Patient Assistance Fund, which provides $250 vouchers that can be used to purchase healthy food, life-saving medicine or gas to get to and from treatment to cancer patients in financial need. Our goal? To meet our overarching $5 million goal -established when the Oncology Patient Assistance Fund was launched in 2014 – in order to create a self-sustaining endowment that will forever help Community cancer patients.
The Beauty Lounge has been recognized as a leader in the salon and medical spa industry. We take pride in the services and state of the art product

ns may be surprised to see young children in restaurants in the evening because children are not usually taken out to restaurants late at night. And if they make a noise in public or in a restaurant it is considered very rude. In recent years children are playing a more active role and they are now accepted in many pubs and restaurants.
In recent years smoking has received a lot of bad publicity, and fewer British people now smoke. Many companies have banned smoking from their offices and canteens. Smoking is now banned on the London Underground, in cinemas and theaters and most buses. It's becoming less and less acceptable to smoke in a public place. It is considered rude or bad manners to smoke in someone's house without permission.
Social rules are an important part of our culture as they passed down through history. The British have an expression for following these "unwritten rules": "When in Rome, do as the Romans do"

------------answer-----------------------
Petunias are among the most popular of garden flowers. They’re easy to care for, inexpensive, and fill the garden with a large variety of colors all summer long. Unfortunately, those colorful blossoms die off quickly, leaving you the job of deadheading petunias. Do you have to deadhead petunias? Only if you want to avoid straggly green stems without blooms for at least half of the season. Keep your garden colorful and productive by deadheading your petunias.
Do You Have to Deadhead Petunias?
Why remove spent petunia flowers? Plants live to reproduce themselves, and annuals, like petunias, create blooms to form new seeds. Once the bloom browns and falls off, the plant spends its energy creating a seed pod filled with seeds.
If you clip off the old bloom and the forming pod by deadheading, the plant will start the process all over again. Instead of a straggly stem

------------question-----------------------
How has the acceptance of children in restaurants changed in recent years
------------correct----------------------
ns may be surprised to see young children in restaurants in the evening because children are not usually taken out to restaurants late at night. And if they make a noise in public or in a restaurant it is considered very rude. In recent years children are playing a more active role and they are now accepted in many pubs and restaurants.
In recent years smoking has received a lot of bad publicity, and fewer British people now smoke. Many companies have banned smoking from their offices and canteens. Smoking is now banned on the London Underground, in cinemas and theaters and most buses. It's becoming less and less acceptable to smoke in a public place. It is considered rude or bad manners to smoke in someone's house without permission.
Social rules are an important part of our culture as they passed down through history. The British have an expression for following these "unwritten rules": "When in Rome, do as the Romans do"

What strategies are recommended for improving lead management and sales enablement capabilities
------------correct----------------------
gies by implementing progressive profiling, testing and optimizing landing pages, aggregating data to create account-level views, and implementing lead routing and lead scoring
- Develop clearly defined lead management processes and improve their ability to track and measure the performance of their lead-to-revenue funnel
- Double down on investing in content so that they can effectively engage potential buyers who are performing research and educating themselves
- Enhance their sales enablement capabilities by improving lead qualification processes (including, specifically, the ability to identify "hot" leads that should be sent immediately to sales), by analyzing the effectiveness of their content resources, and by leveraging technology to make it easier for sales reps to find and access content resources
As noted earlier, these predictions are not particularly surprising. The pressures that Ms. Ross identified have been building for the past few years at least, and leading B2B marketers have been focused on marketing automation, content marketing, and sales enablement for quite some time. It's likely that these issues will remain important for next several years

In Drosophila, distinct mechanisms orient asymmetric cell division along the apical-basal axis in neuroblasts and along the anterior-posterior axis in sensory organ precursor (SOP) cells. Here, we show that heterotrimeric G proteins are essential for asymmetric cell division in both cell types. The G protein subunit Gαi localizes apically in neuroblasts and anteriorly in SOP cells before and during mitosis. Interfering with G protein function by Gαi overexpression or depletion of heterotrimer

What changes have marketing teams, like McNutt's, implemented in their use of martech due to the shift to remote work and tightening budgets
------------correct----------------------
Marketing teams are finding out what their martech can do right now
Before the coronavirus outbreak, Daryl McNutt, senior vice president of marketing for TapClicks, and his team members worked in different offices across the country, with some who worked remotely. Now, with the full team working from home, McNutt says his team is getting much more acquainted with their martech stack. As the marketing lead for a marketing technology company, McNutt oversees a martech stack that includes 33 different tools used across the company’s five brands.
Today’s current economic conditions are forcing many marketers to reconsider their existing processes while simultaneously having to tighten their budgets. Like McNutt, marketing leaders are searching for new ways to maximize the platforms already in use to get more out of the tools they have without adding more processes — or marketing tech — to their already expanding list of responsibilities.
“We’ve been making a conscious effort to dig into all the tools we have access to and use the full scope of their capabilities so we can consolidate the stack,” he said.
“We use Raven Tools for SEO, but we’ve recently started to tap its social analytics capabilities, which we’ve found to be extremely helpful and lightweight,” said McNutt, “Using a platform we’re already familiar with in a new way has helped us operationalize this analytics data more quickly and effectively.”
Another platform McNutt has started using more than ever before is HubSpot. “It has blog hosting capabilities that present a great alternative to WordPress,” said McNutt, “As we cut back on using multiple tools, HubSpot’s CRM and content management solutions have also been helpful add-ons.”
McNutt says he’s even discovered more features within TapClicks own set of tools, including its o

Now, I can’t say that I am comfortable, but I would not trade our current life here for anything. Not anything. On the contrary, I feel so thankful that the Lord kept “perturbing” our hearts until we were finally willing to step out of our comfort zone and follow his leading. There just isn’t anything so satisfying as being in the center of God’s will.
“I tell you the truth,” Jesus replied, “no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age (homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields—and with them, persecutions) and in the age to come, eternal life.” –Mark 10:29-30
OUR HOME HERE
Just before we came here, we found out that there was a room for us in the church! That was really exciting news for us after having stayed at Fabio’s parents house for three months. The church has only been in this building for about four months, so we were glad the Lord timed it so that we would arrive after they had a facility big enough to house us!
Our little room gets more live-able and homey every day. When we got here, it was fine and clean, but very bare. It had a double bed, a single bed, and a crib (which I was extremely thankful for!), but that was it. Now, we have gotten a table and chairs, a shelf, bunk beds and a cabinet. They were all in horrendous condition when we first got them, and in the US we probably would have junked them. But here we were thankful for them and Fabio was able to saw a bit, paint a bit, put in a screw here and there and make them work. It sure makes a difference to have a place to put our things so we don’t have to rummage through suitcases all the time. He also got a board, mounted it to the wall and put some nails in it for hooks so we have a place to hang some things.
About the fourth night we were here, it rained really hard. In our room, it seemed that we didnt have a roof in some places, the rain was coming in so hard! We carried out bucket after bucket of water and tried to find things to sop up the rainwater with. I was glad it let up some around 11pm so we could sleep. The next morning, there was about an inch of rainwater in a pan I had left on the stove! The holes have been patched since then, though, and last night when it rained hard again, we stayed dry and cozy in our room. Thank you, Jesus!
Our room has a bathroom off of it as well. It is getting much more homey too. 🙂 A shower curtain, a curtain in the window, a couple of towel racks, and a mirror cabinet have made a world of difference. But even more than those things was the shower improvements. When we arrived, our “shower” was a pipe sticking out of the wall. The only temperature was COLD (the temp we longed for in Santos!). There is no shower stall or divider of any kind, and with no shower curtain, the entire bathroom got soaked when we showered. We showered and cowered, mostly because there was no curtain in the window either! hehe. Water heaters don’t exist here, but shower heads are available which heat the water as it passes through. On about the fifth day here, Fabio installed one of those and we are now able to shower far more comfortably. This is the before pic and I was SURE I had an after pic, but I can’t find it for the life of me, so I will have to post it later…
“Let your conduct be without covetousness, and be content with such things as you have.” Hebrews 13:5
There is another guy who lives up here, down the hall. His name is Nelson (in the pic above with Fabio). He also has an eight-year-old daughter who is here about half of the time. We share a little kitchenette with him up here. It is pretty primitive, but I am very thankful for it. It was also rather filthy, but I got it scrubbed into shape! He didn’t cook much other than ramen noodles and coffee, so it was not well stocked with much of anything, but we got a couple of boxes of kitchen things donated here to the church last week, and I scored a spatula, a ladel, a cutting board and a few other things that have made a world of difference!
This is our flashy fridge which is on its last leg – an Electrolux from about 1960 I think! It has a little freezer box on the inside which was totally frozen over. We thought the fridge was not working right because it needed to be defrosted, so I set about that task a few days ago. It did not help. Not only does the freezer box not freeze anything, but the fridge doesnt get very cold either, so things spoil really fast. I sure miss ice and ice cream and really, really cold water! Either way, God is good!
“Better is little with the fear of the Lord, than great treasure and trouble therewith.” Proverbs 15:16
Downstairs live another family of leaders in the church, Claudio and Paula and their two daughters, Nicole (8) and Adriele (5). The main kitchen is down there too, where we have a community lunch every day, usually cooked by Paula. I need to get some pictures of them.
The temperature here in Camboriú is far more comfortable – more like summer in Chicago. A couple days it has gotten up to about 100 degrees (38 C), and that is when I realized that I have gotten somewhat acclimated to the heat, because on those days, I just thought, “Hmm, a fan would be nice”, but it really didn’t seem that hot compared to what we had to deal with in Santos. 🙂
Remember Vamilson, from other posts? He has been a big part of our lives here, especially Fabio’s. He stays here every day from early in the morning until evening, to work and eat and stay clean (off drugs), and most importantly, to be discipled from the Word of God. So it is mainly Fabio who is with him all day long, working together, and having Bible studies in the morning and evening.
When he was still on drugs, he got shot in the arm once. He had lost most feeling in his arm and hand due to nerve damage from the wound. The doctor wanted to do surgery, to remove a section of nerve from his leg and replace the one in his arm which was damaged. He was scared about having surgery, and asked the church to pray for him Sunday night. Monday afternoon, Fabio and another guy went with him to the hospital, and the doctor could not believe that he had regained feeling in his arm and hand! He said he wanted to do more tests because he could not believe just his naked eyes, but we know that Jesus has healed him!
THE HOMELESS LOVE FABIO
Since we came here, we have been staying up late most nights pacing the veranda and praying for this area, this neighborhood, the people we see walking by, and the ministry of the church. More and more we are feeling that our hearts are being drawn to the streets, rather than a teaching or preaching ministry inside the church. And as we pray, suddenly many people have started to come to th

by Joe Ament
The Green New Deal is perhaps the most audacious plan to ever seriously address the grave social and environmental challenges we face. By identifying “systemic injustice,” the plan is sweeping in its scope. Yet, while the plan discusses public banks in a reference to adequate capital, the plan fails to see the commercial banking sector as one of the structural causes of, and impediments to solving, the problems we face. Importantly, the Green New Deal fails to articulate exactly why a nationalized banking system is critical to the success of the programs its proposes.
Money is created in modern economies when commercial banks extend interest-bearing loans to individuals and corporations. The money in those loans does not exist before the loan is generated but is created when the bank marks up the borrower’s checking account. This is in stark contrast to the general notion that money is a finite resource, such as gold, that is allocated to its best economic use by the Central Bank.
When money is created by the private sector in the manner discussed above, it is seen as a private resource. Accordingly, public use of money for government spending is viewed as wasteful expenditure rather than productive investment. In the case of the Green New Deal, the massive price tag is seen as cannibalizing the productive private sector. It is for this reason that opponents of the Green New Deal argue that it will hurt the economy, and its proponents argue to “finance” the plan by moving money from one sector to another, e.g. from Wall Street to Main Street.
Money is a social relation. It is an abstract measure of what we all owe to one another.
Money, however, is not a private resource. And it is not a finite commodity. Money is a social relation. It is an abstract measure of what we all owe to one another. Think of it as a tally of everything you owe and are owed, for all the work you do and all the purchases you make. Now extrapolate that to the whole country, let the government manage it—just like it does with laws and other contracts—and you’ve got a monetary system!
The role of the government is crucial in managing the money system. Since money is a social relation, the government is responsible for the money system. Think of what happened in the Great Depression, the Savings and Loan crisis, and the 2008 Financial Crisis: the government always stepped in to repair the money system. And as guarantor of the social relation, it always will.
Monetary theorists understand the government’s monetary prerogative in three ways. First is the government’s ability to choose the unit of account that is used in the country—dollars in the United States and Canada. Second is the government’s ability to issue those units of account into circulation. Third is the benefit of first use that comes with issuing money. This last right is called seigniorage and can be thought of as the profit of creating money above the cost of printing and distributing that money.
Money has existed as a state-managed tally of owing and being owed (of credits and debts in theoretical parlance) for thousands of years. In fact, a lot of evidence suggests that such monetary systems existed for thousands of years before coins and markets—and might even be the reason humans began to settle in the first place! (See Money: The Unauthorized Biography.) Capitalism is a relatively new manne

Tyra left the reigns to the 27-year-old singer last year, but soon decided she wanted to return - leaving Rita out of a job.
She ducked out graciously though, tweeting for her fans to welcome Tyra back.
J Alexander (series 1-13)
Diva Miss J is a former model, who fell into runway coaching after being spotted giving his fellow catwalk stars tips backstage.
He went on to coach supermodel Naomi Campbell and Kimora Lee Simmons, who also judged series 1 of ANTM, as well as Tyra herself.
J coached Tyra's wannabe models for four series before she made him a panellist.
He got his nickname from cycle 1 contestant Robin Manning, who often confused him with fellow judge Jay Manuel - and used to call him 'Miss J' because of his flamboyant outfits.
Miss J still appeared on the show up until the end of series 18, as a runway coach, but then was fired because of the show's plummeting ratings. Nigel Barker and Jay also got the chop.
J handmade all of his clothes on ANTM - with the exception of one nurse's outfit.
He previously revealed: "All the dresses that you see me wear at the challenges, I actually sit down with a needle and thread, not even with a sewing machine, and make them all by hand.
"I made the ruffles and everything."
J has a son called Boris, with his ex-boyfriend. He now splits his time between Paris, France and New York - and published a book in 2010.
Nigel Barker (series 2-18)
British photographer Nigel Barker was a familiar face on ANTM for eight years - until budget cuts saw him sent packing.
The 46-year-old originally wanted to study medicine, but fell into modelling when his mum, a former Miss Sri Lanka beauty queen, entered him in TV model search The Clothes Show.
The 6ft 4in hunk had a 10-year career in modelling before becoming a photographer.
After being let go from ANTM, Nigel went on to direct several acclaimed documentaries and did cameos on shows like Ugly Betty.
Since 2017, he's been a judge on Holland's Next Top Model, and its spin-off show Curvy Supermodel.
Nigel lives in New York with his wife, model and CoverGirl representative Cristen Chin, and kids Jack and Jasmine.
MORE WHERE ARE THEY NOW?
Jay Manuel (series 1-18)
Long before Drew Elliot broke the internet with Kim Kardashian's champagne glass Paper cover, Jay Manuel was the creative director on ANTM.
The 45-year-old featured on every series until his shock sacking - and went on to release a clothing line called Attitude with Sears Canada.
The esteemed make-up artist, who's worked as a stylist for Tyra, Naomi Campbell, Kim Cattrall, David Bowie, J-Lo and Rupert Everett, to name a few, launched Jay Manuel Beauty in 2014.
The brand's aim is to give an Instagram filter finish, without photo editing.
Jay was also a judge for the Miss Universe 2017 pageant and hosted Canada's Next Top Model.

------------question-----------------------
What experiences led the author to feel thankful for their life despite challenges such as poor living conditions and adapting to new surroundings
------------correct----------------------
Now, I can’t say that I am comfortable, but I would not trade our current life here for anything. Not anything. On the contrary, I feel so thankful that the Lord kept “perturbing” our hearts until we were finally willing to step out of our comfort zone and follow his leading. There just isn’t anything so satisfying as being in the center of God’s will.
“I tell you the truth,” Jesus replied, “no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age (homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields—and with them, persecutions) and in the age to come, eternal life.” –Mark 10:29-30
OUR HOME HERE
Just before we came here, we found out that there was a room for us in the church! That was really exciting news for us after having stayed at Fabio’s parents house for three months. The church has only been in this building for about four months, so we were glad the Lord timed it so that we would arrive after they had a facility big enough to house us!
Our little room gets more live-able and homey every day. When we got here, it was fine and clean, but very bare. It had a double bed, a single bed, and a crib (which I was extremely thankful for!), but that was it. Now, we have gotten a table and chairs, a shelf, bunk beds and a cabinet. They were all in horrendous condition when we first got them, and in the US we probably would have junked them. But here we were thankful for them and Fabio was able to saw a bit, paint a bit, put in a screw here and there and make them work. It sure makes a difference to have a place to put our things so we don’t have to rummage through suitcases all the time. He also got a board, mounted it to the wall and put some nails in it for hooks so we have a place to hang some things.
About the fourth night we were here, it rained really hard. In our room, it seemed that we didnt have a roof in some places, the rain was coming in so hard! We carried out bucket after bucket of water and tried to find things to sop up the rainwater with. I was glad it let up some around 11pm so we could sleep. The next morning, there was about an inch of rainwater in a pan I had left on the stove! The holes have been patched since then, though, and last night when it rained hard again, we stayed dry and cozy in our room. Thank you, Jesus!
Our room has a bathroom off of it as well. It is getting much more homey too. 🙂 A shower curtain, a curtain in the window, a couple of towel racks, and a mirror cabinet have made a world of difference. But even more than those things was the shower improvements. When we arrived, our “shower” was a pipe sticking out of the wall. The only temperature was COLD (the temp we longed for in Santos!). There is no shower stall or divider of any kind, and with no shower curtain, the entire bathroom got soaked when we showered. We showered and cowered, mostly because there was no curtain in the window either! hehe. Water heaters don’t exist here, but shower heads are available which heat the water as it passes through. On about the fifth day here, Fabio installed one of those and we are now able to shower far more comfortably. This is the before pic and I was SURE I had an after pic, but I can’t find it for the life of me, so I will have to post it later…
“Let your conduct be without covetousness, and be content with such things as you have.” Hebrews 13:5
There is another guy who lives up here, down the hall. His name is Nelson (in the pic above with Fabio). He also has an eight-year-old daughter who is here about half of the time. We share a little kitchenette with him up here. It is pretty primitive, but I am very thankful for it. It was also rather filthy, but I got it scrubbed into shape! He didn’t cook much other than ramen noodles and coffee, so it was not well stocked with much of anything, but we got a couple of boxes of kitchen things donated here to the church last week, and I scored a spatula, a ladel, a cutting board and a few other things that have made a world of difference!
This is our flashy fridge which is on its last leg – an Electrolux from about 1960 I think! It has a little freezer box on the inside which was totally frozen over. We thought the fridge was not working right because it needed to be defrosted, so I set about that task a few days ago. It did not help. Not only does the freezer box not freeze anything, but the fridge doesnt get very cold either, so things spoil really fast. I sure miss ice and ice cream and really, really cold water! Either way, God is good!
“Better is little with the fear of the Lord, than great treasure and trouble therewith.” Proverbs 15:16
Downstairs live another family of leaders in the church, Claudio and Paula and their two daughters, Nicole (8) and Adriele (5). The main kitchen is down there too, where we have a community lunch every day, usually cooked by Paula. I need to get some pictures of them.
The temperature here in Camboriú is far more comfortable – more like summer in Chicago. A couple days it has gotten up to about 100 degrees (38 C), and that is when I realized that I have gotten somewhat acclimated to the heat, because on those days, I just thought, “Hmm, a fan would be nice”, but it really didn’t seem that hot compared to what we had to deal with in Santos. 🙂
Remember Vamilson, from other posts? He has been a big part of our lives here, especially Fabio’s. He stays here every day from early in the morning until evening, to work and eat and stay clean (off drugs), and most importantly, to be discipled from the Word of God. So it is mainly Fabio who is with him all day long, working together, and having Bible studies in the morning and evening.
When he was still on drugs, he got shot in the arm once. He had lost most feeling in his arm and hand due to nerve damage from the wound. The doctor wanted to do surgery, to remove a section of nerve from his leg and replace the one in his arm which was damaged. He was scared about having surgery, and asked the church to pray for him Sunday night. Monday afternoon, Fabio and another guy went with him to the hospital, and the doctor could not believe that he had regained feeling in his arm and hand! He said he wanted to do more tests because he could not believe just his naked eyes, but we know that Jesus has healed him!
THE HOMELESS LOVE FABIO
Since we came here, we have been staying up late most nights pacing the veranda and praying for this area, this neighborhood, the people we see walking by, and the ministry of the church. More and more we are feeling that our hearts are being drawn to the streets, rather than a teaching or preaching ministry inside the church. And as we pray, suddenly many people have started to come to th
------------expect----------------------
Now, I can’t say that I am comfortable, but I would not trade our current life here for anything. Not anything. On the contrary, I feel so thankful that the Lord kept “perturbing” our hearts until we were finally willing to step out of our comfort zone and follow his leading. There just isn’t anything so satisfying as being in the center of God’s will.
“I tell you the truth,” Jesus replied, “no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age (homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields—and with them, persecutions) and in the age to come, eternal life.” –Mark 10:29-30
OUR HOME HERE
Just before we came here, we found out that there was a room for us in the church! That was really exciting news for us after having stayed at Fabio’s parents house for three months. The church has only been in this building for about four months, so we were glad the Lord timed it so that we would arrive after they had a facility big enough to house us!
Our little room gets more live-able and homey every day. When we got here, it was fine and clean, but very bare. It had a double bed, a single bed, and a crib (which I was extremely thankful for!), but that was it. Now, we have gotten a table and chairs, a shelf, bunk beds and a cabinet. They were all in horrendous condition when we first got them, and in the US we probably would have junked them. But here we were thankful for them and Fabio was able to saw a bit, paint a bit, put in a screw here and there and make them work. It sure makes a difference to have a place to put our things so we don’t have to rummage through suitcases all the time. He also got a board, mounted it to the wall and put some nails in it for hooks so we have a place to hang some things.
About the fourth night we were here, it rained really hard. In our room, it seemed that we didnt have a roof in some places, the rain was coming in so hard! We carried out bucket after bucket of water and tried to find things to sop up the rainwater with. I was glad it let up some around 11pm so we could sleep. The next morning, there was about an inch of rainwater in a pan I had left on the stove! The holes have been patched since then, though, and last night when it rained hard again, we stayed dry and cozy in our room. Thank you, Jesus!
Our room has a bathroom off of it as well. It is getting much more homey too. 🙂 A shower curtain, a curtain in the window, a couple of towel racks, and a mirror cabinet have made a world of difference. But even more than those things was the shower improvements. When we arrived, our “shower” was a pipe sticking out of the wall. The only temperature was COLD (the temp we longed for in Santos!). There is no shower stall or divider of any kind, and with no shower curtain, the entire bathroom got soaked when we showered. We showered and cowered, mostly because there was no curtain in the window either! hehe. Water heaters don’t exist here, but shower heads are available which heat the water as it passes through. On about the fifth day here, Fabio installed one of those and we are now able to shower far more comfortably. This is the before pic and I was SURE I had an after pic, but I can’t find it for the life of me, so I will have to post it later…

What was the main goal of the 2003 Jimmy Carter Work Project as described in the text
------------correct----------------------
2 houses in less than five days. The epic building program, which is part of the 2003 Jimmy Carter Work Project, brought together 24 Juniata students with 51students from four other colleges: Washington University in St. Louis, Mo.; St. Francis University in Loretto, Pa; Valparaiso University in Valparaiso, Ind.; and the University of South Dakota. The program seeks to help eliminate substandard housing in Lowndes County, Ga. through the construction of 35 new habitat homes.
The students built frames for interior walls, which were transported to a separate building site in Valdosta. "We didn't work together as a single Juniata group so it was a great experience learning to work as teams with workers from different places," says Matt Humphrey, a senior from Phillipsburg studying information technology and co-president of Juniata's Habitat for Humanity club.
Another constructive spring break trip gave 17 Juniata students a chance to travel to Asheville, N.C. to work at Eliada Homes, a state orphanage. Together with six students from Elizabethtown College, the group put together and installed playground equipment and painted the school's gymnasium and other buildings.
"Many times at college I feel like I am focused on myself, my grades, and what is going on in my life," says Emily O'Donnell, a freshman from Royersford, Pa. "This spring break trip gave me the opportunity to serve others and make a difference."
The project also branched out into the surrounding community. The students cleaned a section of Reynolds Creek, a polluted tributary of the French Broad River. The team removed 12 refrigerators, 30 car tires, car batteries and several tons of smaller trash items from the banks of the creek. The students also worked at MANNA, a second harvest food bank that gleans fruits and vegetables from harvested farm fields. The students helped glean and organize foods, so donated items could be sent to local soup kitchens.
"The students were willing to volunteer their time but as the week went on they also were able to ask deeper questions about what conditions produced some of the projects we were working on," says Hillary Sherman, PACC-Americorps VISTA coordinator, who led the group on their trip.

"The students were willing to volunteer their time but as the week went on they also were able to ask deeper questions about what conditions produced some of the projects we were working on," says Hillary Sherman, PACC-Americorps VISTA coordinator, who led the group on their trip.

------------question-----------------------
What three actions did the author decide to pursue to improve Japan's presence and future after the G1 Summit
------------correct----------------------
To put it in a different way, what we need to bring back are the values Japanese people had.
To borrow Nonaka’s expressions, such things are tacit knowledge, forum development, apprenticeship, and wise consideration. In Matsuoka’s words, they are peace and aggression, and the pity of court nobles and the glory of samurai warriors. Matsuoka called them inclusive power such as the one that caused Shinto and Buddhism to syncretize. Tasaka said such things correspond with an awareness that “to work is the same as to make ends easy” and a “symbiosis with nature.”
These values do not necessarily belong to preserving things for future generations. This is the case because people in this country might have lost those important values along the way.
I think these values are stated in “Representative Japanese”, a book written by Kanzo Uchimura, and the teachings of Wang Yang-ming. We can trace them back to such sources through history. All we need to do is to bring back those values. We don’t need to create them anew. But bringing back things that had been thrown away once isn’t that easy. That’s why we must try to keep in touch with those good values.
Leaders need a philosophy and beliefs to cope with the turbulent times ahead of them. I feel the foundation for such philosophy and beliefs is in fact buried in life stories of great figures from our respective hometowns and the history of Japan. Intellectual giants including Yoshiko Sakurai delivered this same message at the G1 Summit.
Author’s note: I will post all the discussions related to the points made in this column on the GLOBIS websiteto the maximum extent possible. Let’s share an awareness of the issues, think together, and take concerted actions.
I have many things to do as a newly awakened “leader of Japan,” now that the third G1 Summit is over. Come to think of it, I said the following in my opening speech for the G1 Summit.
“I kept thinking about the things I could do from my position in the private sector as Japan entered a downward curve and its presence continued to decline overseas. I kept thinking frantically about it. What I can do is limited. But I should do what I can. Making up my mind, I decided to do the following three things.
“The first thing I decided to do is to achieve success beyond the borders of Japan and increase Japan’s presence with my own achievements. Through repeated efforts and after many errors, I have reached a stage where I can take the platform at the Davos Forum at long last. I turned myself into a person able to speak at a meeting of the highest international level.
“In the same way, the Graduate School of Management, GLOBIS University is aiming to achieve the top position in Asia, not just in Japan. The school’s advertisement with a photo of my face has already appeared in the Financial Times and the Economist. I’m planning to publish my own books in English as my next step. Harvard Business School has looked at our operations in a case study, too.
“People around the world will say ‘Japanese people are great’ if I achieve such success in the same way as our athletes performing well overseas, such as baseball players Hideki Matsui and Ichiro Suzuki and footballers Shinji Kagawa and Yuto Nagatomo.
“The second thing I chose to do is to communicate with many people in a way that offers them dreams, courage, and knowledge. I’m tweeting, writing blog entries and books, making frequent speeches, and accepting media coverage from such viewpoint. I want to give dreams, courage, and knowledge to many people who are thinking ‘Japan is hopeless.’ I have continued to engage in this communication up to this point.
“The third thing I decided to do is to host the G1 Summit. People call this gathering a ‘Japanese version of the Davos Forum.’ But the G1 Summit surpasses the Davos Forum in significance because its true goal is to network people who think about bettering Japan and the world. People sharing this sense of purpose gather at the G1 Summit from many fields, discuss a variety of issues, paint visions for Japan, and eventually the whole world, and translate them into action. I decided to organize this G1 Summit to network those individuals and urge them to take that action.”
And so I explained my intentions. What to do next came to my mind when the G1 Summit ended. We should develop a vision for Japan. We should launch the “100 actions” I have talked about before. At the same time, we should spread the passion and courage from the G1 Summit as widely as possible and encourage people to act. To do these things, we need G1 initiatives in various fields, such as medical services, tourism and sports. We must pursue these initiatives in a manner that is as open as possible.
To do this, I must use my own time. I must sacrifice something. I may be destined to do those things because doing them halfway will take me nowhere in the environment that exists in Japan now. We only live once and I’d like to make my whole life fulfilling.
In the days ahead, I think I will push ahead with the G1 Summit activities and then the “100 action” project, while sending out my messages to the world. I will take these actions because I must be aware of my position as a leader in Japan now, not some future Japan. I’m going to speak to as many people as possible with this awareness.
“Champions of reforms,” let’s stand up together and connect with each other. I’m going to read all the tweets that appear under the “#G1summit” hash tag at my Twitter site. I welcome your opinions, proposals, comments, and other feedback with open arms.
The time to translate our ideas into action has arrived at last.
It’s time for us to change the future of Japan with our own initiatives.
I’m going back to bed where my kids are sleeping now. These children will have to pay pension premiums and debts totaling close to 100 million yen each. Let’s leave them a brighter future.

To put it in a different way, what we need to bring back are the values Japanese people had.
To borrow Nonaka’s expressions, such things are tacit knowledge, forum development, apprenticeship, and wise consideration. In Matsuoka’s words, they are peace and aggression, and the pity of court nobles and the glory of samurai warriors. Matsuoka called them inclusive power such as the one that caused Shinto and Buddhism to syncretize. Tasaka said such things correspond with an awareness that “to work is the same as to make ends easy” and a “symbiosis with nature.”
These values do not necessarily belong to preserving things for future generations. This is the case because people in this country might have lost those important values along the way.
I think these values are stated in “Representative Japanese”, a book written by Kanzo Uchimura, and the teachings of Wang Yang-ming. We can trace them back to such sources through history. All we need to do is to bring back those values. We don’t need to create them anew. But bringing back things that had been thrown away once isn’t that easy. That’s why we must try to keep in touch with those good values.
Leaders need a philosophy and beliefs to cope with the turbulent times ahead of them. I feel the foundation for such philosophy and beliefs is in fact buried in life stories of great figures from our respective hometowns and the history of Japan. Intellectual giants including Yoshiko Sakurai delivered this same message at the G1 Summit.
Author’s note: I will post all the discussions related to the points made in this column on the GLOBIS websiteto the maximum extent possible. Let’s share an awareness of the issues, think together, and take concerted actions.
I have many things to do as a newly awakened “leader of Japan,” now that the third G1 Summit is over. Come to think of it, I said the following in my opening speech for the G1 Summit.
“I kept thinking about the things I could do from my position in the private sector as Japan entered a downward curve and its presence continued to decline overseas. I kept thinking frantically about it. What I can do is limited. But I should do what I can. Making up my mind, I decided to do the following three things.
“The first thing I decided to do is to achieve success beyond the borders of Japan and increase Japan’s presence with my own achievements. Through repeated efforts and after many errors, I have reached a stage where I can take the platform at the Davos Forum at long last. I turned myself into a person able to speak at a meeting of the highest international level.
“In the same way, the Graduate School of Management, GLOBIS University is aiming to achieve the top position in Asia, not just in Japan. The school’s advertisement with a photo of my face has already appeared in the Financial Times and the Economist. I’m planning to publish my own books in English as my next step. Harvard Business School has looked at our operations in a case study, too.
“People around the world will say ‘Japanese people are great’ if I achieve such success in the same way as our athletes performing well overseas, such as baseball players Hideki Matsui and Ichiro Suzuki and footballers Shinji Kagawa and Yuto Nagatomo.
“The second thing I chose to do is to communicate with many people in a way that offers them dreams, courage, and knowledge. I’m tweeting, writing blog entries and books, making frequent speeches, and accepting media coverage from such viewpoint. I want to give dreams, courage, and knowledge to many people who are thinking ‘Japan is hopeless.’ I have continued to engage in this communication up to this point.
“The third thing I decided to do is to host the G1 Summit. People call this gathering a ‘Japanese version of the Davos Forum.’ But the G1 Summit surpasses the Davos Forum in significance because its true goal is to network people who think about bettering Japan and the world. People sharing this sense of purpose gather at the G1 Summit from many fields, discuss a variety of issues, paint visions for Japan, and eventually the whole world, and translate them into action. I decided to organize this G1 Summit to network those individuals and urge them to take that action.”
And so I explained my intentions. What to do next came to my mind when the G1 Summit ended. We should develop a vision for Japan. We should launch the “100 actions” I have talked about before. At the same time, we should spread the passion and courage from the G1 Summit as widely as possible and encourage people to act. To do these things, we need G1 initiatives in various fields, such as medical services, tourism and sports. We must pursue these initiatives in a manner that is as open as possible.
To do this, I must use my own time. I must sacrifice something. I may be destined to do those things because doing them halfway will take me nowhere in the environment that exists in Japan now. We only live once and I’d like to make my whole life fulfilling.
In the days ahead, I think I will push ahead with the G1 Summit activities and then the “100 action” project, while sending out my messages to the world. I will take these actions because I must be aware of my position as a leader in Japan now, not some future Japan. I’m going to speak to as many people as possible with this awareness.

What changes and improvements are recommended for the 2015 Toyota Tundra
------------correct----------------------
c improvisation in the new Toyota Tundra. The aerodynamic will influence the exterior pieces and also the size. It is better to always make this car looks strong and big because it is truck vehicle type. Third, there will be new direct injection too in this car but Toyota doesn’t give detail information about it. Fourth, Toyota Tundra will be completed with engine stop and start because Toyota will not use it in 2014 Toyota Tundra.
Recommended Changes for 2015 Toyota Tundra
When it is clear that Toyota will do some changes above in their new Toyota Tundra, some people still want that Toyota also considers of some other parts that also influence the car performance. Some experts then recommend Toyota to change some parts such as: First the variable valve lifts. Toyota better changes the old valve timing with variable valve lift. Second, Toyota better changes the hydraulic steering with the electric steering system that is more efficient that the old steering system. Third, Toyota needs to use the best powertrain engine system that is more effective for their future car. We will know whether Toyota will change some parts above or not. We just can wait until Toyota releases 2015 Toyota Tundra to the market.
Toyota must work hard to make best 2015 Toyota Tundra by doing some changes in technical specification and also designs.

What version of PCI Express does PLDA license to Tehuti Networks, and what are its distinguishing features
------------correct----------------------
San Jose, Calif., March 28, 2006
—PLDApplications (PLDA) today announced the licensing of its x8 250 MHz PCIe® IP to Tehuti Networks.
"We needed a concrete PCI Express solution," explains Haim Bar-David, Chief Technical Officer of Tehuti Networks. "PLDA offered a functional demonstration of a x8 solution that will serve all of our silicon needs, from FPGA to ASIC". PLDA will showcase the same demonstration at the Embedded Systems Conference (ESC) in San Jose, CA, the 4-6 of April (booth 3132).
PLDA's market-proven Xpress Rich IP offers a high-performance architecture in a highly configurable RTL-level function and supports a variety of silicon technologies, such as FPGAs and 65 nm ASIC. Suitable for endpoint designs, the core offers a 64-bit data path at 2.5 Gbps per lane (up to two virtual channels) and is a secure and proven solution verified with multiple validation IP vendors and interoperable with all of the main PHY IP vendors.
Tehuti Networks offers system-on-a chip (SOCs) solutions for removing server I/O bottlenecks in 10 Gigabit Ethernet networks. To help manage the increased load, Tehuti has adopted PCI Express; a shift that, combined with their network accelerating IP, permits them to offer solutions that improve the performance of their clients' applications by up to 150%.
"The configurable nature of PLDA's IP was a good fit for Tehuti Networks’ incremental development approach," continues Mr. Bar-David. "We started prototyping with a x4 core and a single 10 Gbps Ethernet link. By reconfiguring the same IP, we quickly evolved into a x8 design with two 10 Gbps Ethernet links."
Since the earliest introduction of the PCI Express protocol, PLDA has consistently listed products on the PCI-SIG integrator list. Today

I'm loving what Kermit Erasmus is doing for Pirates and Bafana.
We managed to catch up with Klate, Lekgwathi & Erasmus at full time to get their 1st impressions of Klate: It takes some getting used to. It's very light, much lighter than the last ball we used. Lucky Lekgwathi: For me it was ok, I think my biggest challenge was the pitch. In the 1st half we had to be very careful at the back in our box. Kermit Erasmus: The jury is still out, the more we play with it the sooner we will get used to it. It moves a lot in the air. RDS: We played in patches & looked very scrappy. They are a physical, hard running side. We are happy with the 3 points. RDS: I agree with Sammy, we had a good chance when the ball fell to Oupa, I feel though we should have killed the game off sooner still. RDS: We are looking forward to the break. It's been a crazy 4 months. This is our 24th match I think. RDS: We have the last game on Sunday then prepare for the 23rd January 2014 against AmaZulu away, as things stand. We try keep that level of complacency from creeping in after we score. But at ...

De Sa relieved Pirates are off the bottom of PSL log Pirates remained in the relegation zone despite their sweet revenge over Platinum Stars, but De Sa is happy to be off the foot of the PSL log 17 Dec 2013 Following Orlando Pirates’ emphatic win over Platinum Stars on Monday afternoon, coach Roger De Sa congratulated man of the match Kermit Erasmus and the rest of the team. Pirates wrapped up the game inside the opening 33 minutes with three goals, and De Sa admitted that the heat made it difficult for them to maintain the same pace throughout. “Well done to Kermit, the guys played really well in the first half hour or so,” said De Sa after the game. “After that I think the heat took a lot out of the players and the pace of the game dropped, and we just had to see out the game,” he said. The 49-year-old De Sa expressed his delight at climbing the log as the Buccaneers now find themselves 15th on the log, but he wants his players to keep working hard especially with the games coming thick and fa ...
Orlando Pirates returned to form with a commanding 3-0 victory over Platinum Stars in their Absa Premiership clash at the Royal Bafokeng Sports Palace on Monday. The Buccaneers made a fast start to stun the home team, as goals inside the first 32 minutes from Thandani Ntshumayelo, Oupa Manyisa and Dlaine Klate gave them an advantage they never looked like relinquishing. Pirates coach Roger De Sa selected Kermit Erasmus for the striking role and it would pay off handsomely as the nippy forward had a hand in all three of their goals. Despite reports in the media last week that Ghana international goalkeeper Fatau Dauda would be involved in some form for Pirates, he was again left out of the match-day 18 with Senzo Meyiwa starting and Brighton Mhlongo on the bench.

What negative consequences can result from parents over-mounting their children in youth equine sports
------------correct----------------------
If you’ve spent much time around any youth sports—from baseball to soccer to junior rodeo—you’ve seen it: Parents wanting their child to win more than that child does.
While that dilemma is problematic in any pursuit, in equine sports, it can be flat dangerous.
“For one, everybody wants to win,” Casey Branquinho, our SafeStart expert and California cow-horse trainer, said. “I see parents over-mount their young kids because they want to be competitive, and the kid is hanging on for dear life with the horse just doing whatever it does. Unless you’re a professional horse trainer or trying to make the NFR, this is supposed to be fun. If your kid is intimidated and cannot pull the horse to a stop, it’s not fun. That goes for any age, really.”

Sure, there are kids who somehow gentle-down a sale-barn find that bucked off every previous owner, or youth who beat up on all the professionals at the big shows, but those are the exception, not the rule.
Overmounting kids can have lasting negative side effects, Branquinho said, but still many parents fall for this too-common trap.
The Problems with Overmounting
1. Injury. “Some people selling horses will tell parents ‘Your kid can grow into this horse.’ But that’s rarely the case. Kids’ horses should be slow, steady, and enjoyable.

Who was the first judge on America's Next Top Model and what reasons did she give for her critiques
------------correct----------------------
AMERICA'S Next Top model has racked up an impressive 24 series, and it has a huge roll call of former judges to prove it - 22 to be exact.
Even Tyra Banks decided to give series 23 a miss. From Twiggy to Janice Dickinson, these are the stars you forgot judged the modelling talent show since it began in 2003 - and what the show's famous names are doing now...
Janice Dickinson (series 1-4)
Supermodel Janice, 63, was a judge on the first four series of ANTM, and appeared as a guest judge for four cycles thereafter.
The mum-of-two was known for her tough critiques, and Tyra fired her as a result.
Janice later said: "I was just telling the truth and I was saving these girls from going out there and being told that they're too short, too fat, their skin's not good enough.
"I was to America's Next Top Model what Simon Cowell is to American Idol."
She was given her own show, The Janice Dickinson Modelling Agency, from 2006-08, but this was nowhere near as successful as Tyra's one.
Janice, who's been married four times, went on to star in I'm A Celeb, in 2007, and the US version of the jungle reality show two years later.
She then went into the Big Brother house in 2015.
Twiggy (series 5-9)
After firing Janice, Tyra swiftly replaced her with model Lesley Lawson - better known as Twiggy.
The iconic 60s star, who's known for her signature big eyes, long lashes and short hair, went on to return to modelling with M&S in 2005.
The mum-of-one, 68, also released an album, called Romantically Yours, in 2011.
Paulina Porizjova (series 10-12)
Twiggy's replacement was Czech-born Swedish model and actress Paulina Porizjova, now 53.
She smashed into the spotlight at the age of 18, when she became the first woman from Central Europe to earn a Sports Illustrated cover.
Paulina, too, was fired from the show - claiming producers said she had an "ego problem" when she complained about Tyra's reported lateness to set.
She went on to guest star as herself in Desperate Housewives, and appear in a couple of documentaries.
Andre Leon Talley (series 14-17)
Andre Leon Talley is a big name in fashion, after working as Vogue's editor-at-large between 1998 and 2013.
The 68-year-old racked up four series of ANTM in two years, before leaving the show (and Vogue) to serve as international editor for Russian Numero.
The job wasn't a success, and Andre resigned after 12 issues.
Kelly Cutrone (series 18-22)
People's Revolution founder Kelly Cutrone, 52, became a household name when she appeared in The Hills and The City with Lauren Conrad and Whitney Port, between 2008 and 2009.
The expert fashion publicist then replaced Andre on ANTM - and swiftly disappeared from the public eye when she left the show.
Rita Ora (series 23)
With only one series on ANTM, it's easy to forget Rita Ora once hosted the show

Plans to develop a new district heating scheme, under the Exeter and East Devon Growth Point partnership are now one step closer to becoming a reality after the scheme was earmarked for up to £5m investment from the Homes and Communities Agency.
This new district heating scheme could serve new homes and businesses in the Monkerton, Pinhoe, Tithebarn Green and Exeter Science Park developments and is just one of 14 major sites nationally that will now proceed to a due diligence process with the HCA, to receive a share of its £474m Local Infrastructure Fund.
The Exeter and East Devon Growth Point partners involved in the scheme are celebrating that the Government has again recognised the potential of the area, and the work that has already taken place to help reduce carbon emissions and create energy efficient heat and power across Exeter and East Devon.
Once complete, the scheme will eventually heat 2,900 houses in Monkerton, Pinhoe and the Tithebarn Green development and will also serve Exeter Science Park. The system will work in the same way as the network already up and running for Cranbrook and Skypark, which will save 13,000 tonnes of CO2 per year - the equivalent of taking 5,200 cars from the road!
Following Cranbrook's example
Cllr Paul Diviani, Leader of East Devon District Council said: “We have shown at Cranbrook and Skypark that district heating is the way forward. Government has clearly recognised that and now this award from the LIF gives us an opportunity to build upon that success.”
Cllr Rachel Sutton, Exeter City Council Lead Councillor for Sustainable Development and Transport said: “It is so pleasin

Why is regular sewer line cleaning important for homeowners
------------correct----------------------
For many homeowners, maintaining a home’s plumbing system involves a familiar checklist, which typically includes fixing leaky faucets, unclogging drains, and inspecting water heaters. However, sewer line cleaning is an essential plumbing service that often gets overlooked but holds significant money-saving potential. Uncover how this seemingly mundane plumbing service can safeguard your finances in the long run.
Avoiding Costly Repairs
Over time, debris, grease, soap residue, hair, and other materials can accumulate and form obstructions within the sewer pipes. These blockages restrict wastewater flow, leading to slow drains, backups, and potential sewage spills. Additionally, when sewer lines become clogged, the pressure within the pipes increases. This heightened pressure can cause the pipes to crack, resulting in leaks or even bursts. Repairing or replacing damaged sewer pipes can be costly, involving excavation, pipe replacement, and professional labor. By scheduling regular cleaning for your sewer lines, you can prevent the accumulation of materials like debris, hair, grease, and tree roots that contribute to clogs and blockages, thereby reducing the chances of pipe damage and the subsequent need for extensive repairs.
Preventing Health Hazards
Blocked sewers release harmful bacteria, viruses, and pathogens that can negatively impact indoor air quality, creating an unhealthy living environment. Individuals exposed to these conditions may experience respiratory discomfort and allergies. These pathogens can also worsen pre-existing respiratory conditions like asthma. These health issues can lead to increased medical expenses, missed workdays, and reduced productivity. By prioritizing regular sewer line cleaning, you can help maintain a clean environment and significantly reduce the risk of health hazards associated with sewage backups and spills.
Enhancing System Efficiency
When debris, sediment, and grease accumulate within your sewer lines, your sewer system will work harder to push the sewage through, resultin

Топик Unwritten Rules of Great Britain
Good and bad manners make up the social rules of a country. They are not always easy to learn because they are often not written down in books. For example, British women didn't go into pubs at the beginning of this century because it was not considered respectable behaviour for a woman.
Now both women and men drink freely is pubs and women are fully integrated into public life. Visitors to Britain are often surprised by the strange behaviour of the inhabitants. One of the worst mistakes is to get on a bus without waiting your turn in the queue. The other people in the queue will probably complain loudly! Queuing is a national habit and it is considered polite or good manners to wait for your turn.
In some countries it is considered bad manners to eat in the street, whereas in Britain it is common to see people having a snack whilst walking down the road, especially at lunchtime. Brito

Juniata Students Seek Out Alternative Spring Break Service Trips
(Posted March 24, 2003)
HUNTINGDON, Pa. -- While many college students this year frolicked in such spring-break havens as Daytona Beach, San Padre Island and Virginia Beach, several groups of students from Juniata College found fun in the sun by performing a variety of service projects in Georgia, North Carolina and Guatemala.
An international trip led by Henry Thurston-Griswold, professor of Spanish at Juniata, and Kelly Turlish, coordinator of community service/service learning at the college, took a group of 15 Juniata students to Guatemala over spring break.
The group met with 10 nongovernmental and community-based organizations that are working in such areas as human rights, education and sustainable development. "The students were able to see international development at the ground level," Turlish says. "Our hope is that the students will return and compare their experience to their lives in the United States, and then help educate others to create change here and abroad."
The students spent three days as volunteers at Colegio Miguel Angel Asturias, a private school for low-income students located in the city of Quetzaltenango. While at the school, they installed and networked three donated computers. In addition the Juniata students taught English as a Foreign Language classes, conducted science experiments and offered other activities for the children.
"Going to the plantaion made me question what my basic needs really are," says Katie O'Donnell., a junior from Royersford, Pa. "I saw very many horrible situations, things that I never wanted to think about or see. Yet, at the same time, we recognized the efforts of great human rights organizations and very inspiring people who give hope to the Guatemalan situation."
The group also visited San Basilio plantation, where the group met with the regional leader of the Southern Coast for the Community of Peasant Unity, an organization that helps peasants obtain legal rights to land. "We learned a great deal about Guatemala's current conditions and its history, which makes you appreciate how well the government of the United States works," Turlish says.
Another group of students from Juniata's Habitat for Humanity Club traveled to Valdosta, Ga. and framed 2

Marketing teams are finding out what their martech can do right now
Before the coronavirus outbreak, Daryl McNutt, senior vice president of marketing for TapClicks, and his team members worked in different offices across the country, with some who worked remotely. Now, with the full team working from home, McNutt says his team is getting much more acquainted with their martech stack. As the marketing lead for a marketing technology company, McNutt oversees a martech stack that includes 33 different tools used across the company’s five brands.
Today’s current economic conditions are forcing many marketers to reconsider their existing processes while simultaneously having to tighten their budgets. Like McNutt, marketing leaders are searching for new ways to maximize the platforms already in use to get more out of the tools they have without adding more processes — or marketing tech — to their already expanding list of responsibilities.
“We’ve been making a conscious effort to dig into all the tools we have access to and use the full scope of their capabilities so we can consolidate the stack,” he said.
“We use Raven Tools for SEO, but we’ve recently started to tap its social analytics capabilities, which we’ve found to be extremely helpful and lightweight,” said McNutt, “Using a platform we’re already familiar with in a new way has helped us operationalize this analytics data more quickly and effectively.”
Another platform McNutt has started using more than ever before is HubSpot. “It has blog hosting capabilities that present a great alternative to WordPress,” said McNutt, “As we cut back on using multiple tools, HubSpot’s CRM and content management solutions have also been helpful add-ons.”
McNutt says he’s even discovered more features within TapClicks own set of tools, including its o

What type of opportunity did VFILES give to independent designers at Fashion Week
------------correct----------------------
ove subversive move yet is giving four independent designers and VFILES users—selected solely on the basis of the GIFS, lookbooks and illustrations uploaded to their profiles—a stage at Fashion Week. Providing such an opportunity to unknowns on the strength of their online profiles isn’t just a conflation of URL and IRL, it’s a potentially pivotal moment in the ongoing democratization of fashion.
Despite the lighthearted vibes backstage, there wasn’t any goofing around come showtime, as Nicki Minaj’s straight-faced “Did It On Em” blared from speakers. Designers Sam MC, Ammerman Schlösberg, Steven Tai, and Gypsy Sport delivered complete and—true to their patron’s M.O.—transgressive visions. New trends included dominatrix, latex bow dresses courtesy of Schlösberg and long macramé veils and socks-with-rope sandals by Gypsy Sport. Those bold enough to try them, take heed to VFILES' advice: "Smize/ Have fun.

What are the steps to forward ports for gaming on a router
------------correct----------------------
machine's IP address.
- A list of TCP and UDP ports that need to be forwarded.
How to find your router's IP Address
The easiest way to locate your router's IP address is to run our free Router Detector utility. It's a part of the Network Utilities suite of tools and it's completely free to use.
How To Forward Ports
A smart way to forward your ports is to use Network Utilities. Since Network Utilities allows you to both forward and un-forward ports easily you can keep your network security maximized, and then forward ports only when you need them. Alternatively you can do it by hand.
The process for forwarding a port is generally:
- Open a web browser and navigate to your router's IP address.
- Locate your routers port forwarding section.
- Put the IP address of your computer or gaming console in the appropriate box in your router.
- Put the TCP and UDP ports for your game in the corresponding boxes in your router.
- Intermittently you have to reboot your router for the changes to take effect.
Ports To Forward for Initial 2: New Stage
The ports that need to be forwarded in your router for Initial 2: New Stage are as follows:
Initial 2: New Stage - Steam
- TCP: 27015-27030, 27036-27037
- UDP: 4380, 27000-27031, 27036
Initial 2: New Stage - Xbox One
- TCP: 3074
- UDP: 88, 500, 3074, 3544, 4500
We have guides that are custom tailored for Initial 2: New Stage that will show you the incoming ports that need to be forwarded.
That's all it takes to open your ports. Want more? Check out our growing list of games and applications

What are some reasons mentioned for ensuring kids have the appropriate horse when learning to ride

top safely. I’ve seen too many kids plow through crowds or other horses in warm up pens, and it’s just flat dangerous.”
2. Lost interest. “I’ve seen kids lose interest because they were too scared when put on a horse that was way too much for them time and time again. It’s like Little League parents putting their kid in a division they’re not ready for. They get hit with a line drive or a pitch and boom, they never want to play again.”
[SHOP KIDS’ MOTIVATION: “The Boy Who Never Gave Up” Stephen Curry’s Children’s Motivational Book]
3. Setting the bar too high. “I’ve also seen junior rodeo parents spend everything they have for their kids in the 12-and-under division to have a $30,000 horse. That horse won’t last forever, and now your kid is used to the best horse there is. Will you have $60,000 to move your child up to the next great horse at that point? Because it will be hard to lower their expectations when they’re used to the best. Plus, those kids aren’t learning how to ride one and make one early on. I’m not saying kids should be on broncs by any means, but there’s something to be said for working at it on something that isn’t 100% NFR caliber right off the bat.”
The biggest rule to follow when looking for a kid’s horse is making sure your child can stay in control at all times.
“That means tied to the trailer, in the warm-up pen, in the arena, on the trail, wherever they are,” Branquinho said. “Just don’t live through your kids by putting them on too much horse. This is supposed to be fun for everybody.” H&R

Why is it important to deadhead petunias
------------correct----------------------
Petunias are among the most popular of garden flowers. They’re easy to care for, inexpensive, and fill the garden with a large variety of colors all summer long. Unfortunately, those colorful blossoms die off quickly, leaving you the job of deadheading petunias. Do you have to deadhead petunias? Only if you want to avoid straggly green stems without blooms for at least half of the season. Keep your garden colorful and productive by deadheading your petunias.
Do You Have to Deadhead Petunias?
Why remove spent petunia flowers? Plants live to reproduce themselves, and annuals, like petunias, create blooms to form new seeds. Once the bloom browns and falls off, the plant spends its energy creating a seed pod filled with seeds.
If you clip off the old bloom and the forming pod by deadheading, the plant will start the process all over again. Instead of a straggly stem

gies by implementing progressive profiling, testing and optimizing landing pages, aggregating data to create account-level views, and implementing lead routing and lead scoring
- Develop clearly defined lead management processes and improve their ability to track and measure the performance of their lead-to-revenue funnel
- Double down on investing in content so that they can effectively engage potential buyers who are performing research and educating themselves
- Enhance their sales enablement capabilities by improving lead qualification processes (including, specifically, the ability to identify "hot" leads that should be sent immediately to sales), by analyzing the effectiveness of their content resources, and by leveraging technology to make it easier for sales reps to find and access content resources
As noted earlier, these predictions are not particularly surprising. The pressures that Ms. Ross identified have been building for the past few years at least, and leading B2B marketers have been focused on marketing automation, content marketing, and sales enablement for quite some time. It's likely that these issues will remain important for next several years

Plans to develop a new district heating scheme, under the Exeter and East Devon Growth Point partnership are now one step closer to becoming a reality after the scheme was earmarked for up to £5m investment from the Homes and Communities Agency.
This new district heating scheme could serve new homes and businesses in the Monkerton, Pinhoe, Tithebarn Green and Exeter Science Park developments and is just one of 14 major sites nationally that will now proceed to a due diligence process with the HCA, to receive a share of its £474m Local Infrastructure Fund.
The Exeter and East Devon Growth Point partners involved in the scheme are celebrating that the Government has again recognised the potential of the area, and the work that has already taken place to help reduce carbon emissions and create energy efficient heat and power across Exeter and East Devon.
Once complete, the scheme will eventually heat 2,900 houses in Monkerton, Pinhoe and the Tithebarn Green development and will also serve Exeter Science Park. The system will work in the same way as the network already up and running for Cranbrook and Skypark, which will save 13,000 tonnes of CO2 per year - the equivalent of taking 5,200 cars from the road!
Following Cranbrook's example
Cllr Paul Diviani, Leader of East Devon District Council said: “We have shown at Cranbrook and Skypark that district heating is the way forward. Government has clearly recognised that and now this award from the LIF gives us an opportunity to build upon that success.”

San Jose, Calif., March 28, 2006
—PLDApplications (PLDA) today announced the licensing of its x8 250 MHz PCIe® IP to Tehuti Networks.
"We needed a concrete PCI Express solution," explains Haim Bar-David, Chief Technical Officer of Tehuti Networks. "PLDA offered a functional demonstration of a x8 solution that will serve all of our silicon needs, from FPGA to ASIC". PLDA will showcase the same demonstration at the Embedded Systems Conference (ESC) in San Jose, CA, the 4-6 of April (booth 3132).
PLDA's market-proven Xpress Rich IP offers a high-performance architecture in a highly configurable RTL-level function and supports a variety of silicon technologies, such as FPGAs and 65 nm ASIC. Suitable for endpoint designs, the core offers a 64-bit data path at 2.5 Gbps per lane (up to two virtual channels) and is a secure and proven solution verified with multiple validation IP vendors and interoperable with all of the main PHY IP vendors.
Tehuti Networks offers system-on-a chip (SOCs) solutions for removing server I/O bottlenecks in 10 Gigabit Ethernet networks. To help manage the increased load, Tehuti has adopted PCI Express; a shift that, combined with their network accelerating IP, permits them to offer solutions that improve the performance of their clients' applications by up to 150%.
"The configurable nature of PLDA's IP was a good fit for Tehuti Networks’ incremental development approach," continues Mr. Bar-David. "We started prototyping with a x4 core and a single 10 Gbps Ethernet link. By reconfiguring the same IP, we quickly evolved into a x8 design with two 10 Gbps Ethernet links."
Since the earliest introduction of the PCI Express protocol, PLDA has consistently listed products on the PCI-SIG integrator list. Today

FADER NYFW, Spring 2014
Backstage at VFILES hung a sign that read: “Smize/ Have fun/ Don’t be too serious/ High energy.” This playful message isn’t what you’d expect to see at New York Fashion Week—a bi-yearly event where designers put forth their months of hard work along with hefty capital for a meticulous production that lasts a mere few moments-- but that’s the point.
VFILES has been injecting much-needed creativity (and LOLz) into the industry with its alternative online fashion community, curated high-street store, and the industry-parodying video series “What the F*shion?”. The site, which only launched last year has challenged the face of fashion and its role in culture by offering unisex clothing, selling it as trends arise instead of seasonally, and bringing to light Internet fashion memes that—aside from outlier designers like Jeremy Scott-- haven’t received the runway treatment.

ove subversive move yet is giving four independent designers and VFILES users—selected solely on the basis of the GIFS, lookbooks and illustrations uploaded to their profiles—a stage at Fashion Week. Providing such an opportunity to unknowns on the strength of their online profiles isn’t just a conflation of URL and IRL, it’s a potentially pivotal moment in the ongoing democratization of fashion.
Despite the lighthearted vibes backstage, there wasn’t any goofing around come showtime, as Nicki Minaj’s straight-faced “Did It On Em” blared from speakers. Designers Sam MC, Ammerman Schlösberg, Steven Tai, and Gypsy Sport delivered complete and—true to their patron’s M.O.—transgressive visions. New trends included dominatrix, latex bow dresses courtesy of Schlösberg and long macramé veils and socks-with-rope sandals by Gypsy Sport.

To put it in a different way, what we need to bring back are the values Japanese people had.
To borrow Nonaka’s expressions, such things are tacit knowledge, forum development, apprenticeship, and wise consideration. In Matsuoka’s words, they are peace and aggression, and the pity of court nobles and the glory of samurai warriors. Matsuoka called them inclusive power such as the one that caused Shinto and Buddhism to syncretize. Tasaka said such things correspond with an awareness that “to work is the same as to make ends easy” and a “symbiosis with nature.”
These values do not necessarily belong to preserving things for future generations. This is the case because people in this country might have lost those important values along the way.
I think these values are stated in “Representative Japanese”, a book written by Kanzo Uchimura, and the teachings of Wang Yang-ming. We can trace them back to such sources through history. All we need to do is to bring back those values. We don’t need to create them anew. But bringing back things that had been thrown away once isn’t that easy. That’s why we must try to keep in touch with those good values.
Leaders need a philosophy and beliefs to cope with the turbulent times ahead of them. I feel the foundation for such philosophy and beliefs is in fact buried in life stories of great figures from our respective hometowns and the history of Japan. Intellectual giants including Yoshiko Sakurai delivered this same message at the G1 Summit.
Author’s note: I will post all the discussions related to the points made in this column on the GLOBIS websiteto the maximum extent possible. Let’s share an awareness of the issues, think together, and take concerted actions.
I have many things to do as a newly awakened “leader of Japan,” now that the third G1 Summit is over. Come to think of it, I said the following in my opening speech for the G1 Summit.
“I kept thinking about the things I could do from my position in the private sector as Japan entered a downward curve and its presence continued to decline overseas. I kept thinking frantically about it. What I can do is limited. But I should do what I can. Making up my mind, I decided to do the following three things.
“The first thing I decided to do is to achieve success beyond the borders of Japan and increase Japan’s presence with my own achievements. Through repeated efforts and after many errors, I have reached a stage where I can take the platform at the Davos Forum at long last. I turned myself into a person able to speak at a meeting of the highest international level.
“In the same way, the Graduate School of Management, GLOBIS University is aiming to achieve the top position in Asia, not just in Japan. The school’s advertisement with a photo of my face has already appeared in the Financial Times and the Economist. I’m planning to publish my own books in English as my next step. Harvard Business School has looked at our operations in a case study, too.
“People around the world will say ‘Japanese people are great’ if I achieve such success in the same way as our athletes performing well overseas, such as baseball players Hideki Matsui and Ichiro Suzuki and footballers Shinji Kagawa and Yuto Nagatomo.
“The second thing I chose to do is to communicate with many people in a way that offers them dreams, courage, and knowledge. I’m tweeting, writing blog entries and books, making frequent speeches, and accepting media coverage from such viewpoint. I want to give dreams, courage, and knowledge to many people who are thinking ‘Japan is hopeless.’ I have continued to engage in this communication up to this point.
“The third thing I decided to do is to host the G1 Summit. People call this gathering a ‘Japanese version of the Davos Forum.’ But the G1 Summit surpasses the Davos Forum in significance because its true goal is to network people who think about bettering Japan and the world. People sharing this sense of purpose gather at the G1 Summit from many fields, discuss a variety of issues, paint visions for Japan, and eventually the whole world, and translate them into action. I decided to organize this G1 Summit to network those individuals and urge them to take that action.”
And so I explained my intentions. What to do next came to my mind when the G1 Summit ended. We should develop a vision for Japan. We should launch the “100 actions” I have talked about before. At the same time, we should spread the passion and courage from the G1 Summit as widely as possible and encourage people to act. To do these things, we need G1 initiatives in various fields, such as medical services, tourism and sports. We must pursue these initiatives in a manner that is as open as possible.
To do this, I must use my own time. I must sacrifice something. I may be destined to do those things because doing them halfway will take me nowhere in the environment that exists in Japan now. We only live once and I’d like to make my whole life fulfilling.
In the days ahead, I think I will push ahead with the G1 Summit activities and then the “100 action” project, while sending out my messages to the world. I will take these actions because I must be aware of my position as a leader in Japan now, not some future Japan. I’m going to speak to as many people as possible with this awareness.
“Champions of reforms,” let’s stand up together and connect with each other. I’m going to read all the tweets that appear under the “#G1summit” hash tag at my Twitter site. I welcome your opinions, proposals, comments, and other feedback with open arms.
The time to translate our ideas into action has arrived at last.
It’s time for us to change the future of Japan with our own initiatives.
I’m going back to bed where my kids are sleeping now. These children will have to pay pension premiums and debts totaling close to 100 million yen each. Let’s leave them a brighter future.

For many homeowners, maintaining a home’s plumbing system involves a familiar checklist, which typically includes fixing leaky faucets, unclogging drains, and inspecting water heaters. However, sewer line cleaning is an essential plumbing service that often gets overlooked but holds significant money-saving potential. Uncover how this seemingly mundane plumbing service can safeguard your finances in the long run.
Avoiding Costly Repairs
Over time, debris, grease, soap residue, hair, and other materials can accumulate and form obstructions within the sewer pipes. These blockages restrict wastewater flow, leading to slow drains, backups, and potential sewage spills. Additionally, when sewer lines become clogged, the pressure within the pipes increases. This heightened pressure can cause the pipes to crack, resulting in leaks or even bursts. Repairing or replacing damaged sewer pipes can be costly, involving excavation, pipe replacement, and professional labor. By scheduling regular cleaning for your sewer lines, you can prevent the accumulation of materials like debris, hair, grease, and tree roots that contribute to clogs and blockages, thereby reducing the chances of pipe damage and the subsequent need for extensive repairs.
Preventing Health Hazards
Blocked sewers release harmful bacteria, viruses, and pathogens that can negatively impact indoor air quality, creating an unhealthy living environment. Individuals exposed to these conditions may experience respiratory discomfort and allergies. These pathogens can also worsen pre-existing respiratory conditions like asthma. These health issues can lead to increased medical expenses, missed workdays, and reduced productivity. By prioritizing regular sewer line cleaning, you can help maintain a clean environment and significantly reduce the risk of health hazards associated with sewage backups and spills.
Enhancing System Efficiency
When debris, sediment, and grease accumulate within your sewer lines, your sewer system will work harder to push the sewage through, resultin

Good and bad manners make up the social rules of a country. They are not always easy to learn because they are often not written down in books. For example, British women didn't go into pubs at the beginning of this century because it was not considered respectable behaviour for a woman.
Now both women and men drink freely is pubs and women are fully integrated into public life. Visitors to Britain are often surprised by the strange behaviour of the inhabitants. One of the worst mistakes is to get on a bus without waiting your turn in the queue. The other people in the queue will probably complain loudly!

In some countries it is considered bad manners to eat in the street, whereas in Britain it is common to see people having a snack whilst walking down the road, especially at lunchtime. Brito

Queuing is a national habit and it is considered polite or good manners to wait for your turn.
In some countries it is considered bad manners to eat in the street, whereas in Britain it is common to see people having a snack whilst walking down the road, especially at lunchtime. Brito

------------correct----------------------
FADER NYFW, Spring 2014
Backstage at VFILES hung a sign that read: “Smize/ Have fun/ Don’t be too serious/ High energy.” This playful message isn’t what you’d expect to see at New York Fashion Week—a bi-yearly event where designers put forth their months of hard work along with hefty capital for a meticulous production that lasts a mere few moments-- but that’s the point.
VFILES has been injecting much-needed creativity (and LOLz) into the industry with its alternative online fashion community, curated high-street store, and the industry-parodying video series “What the F*shion?”. The site, which only launched last year has challenged the face of fashion and its role in culture by offering unisex clothing, selling it as trends arise instead of seasonally, and bringing to light Internet fashion memes that—aside from outlier designers like Jeremy Scott-- haven’t received the runway treatment.

What impact would a nationalized money supply have on the goals of the Green New Deal according to the text
------------correct----------------------
r of social organization and is characterized by a transition from state-created money to bank-created money.
Think about that for a moment. Capitalism is about bank-created money! For thousands of years, the state, for better or worse, controlled three monetary prerogatives discussed above. The state created money by spending it into existence and guaranteed its value by levying taxes in the unit of account in which it spent. Beginning around the twelfth century, however, states began to expand beyond what their power to tax could justify and so they asked private merchants for loans. (See Brown 2013, p.111, and Davies 2002, p.261.) Slowly but surely, states lost the majority of their power to create money and the seigniorage benefit that came with that creation. States only kept the power to determine the unit of account. But with that power came the responsibility to manage the stability of the unit of account.
There has been precious little discussion on ending or reigning in the commercial banking industry’s money-creation power.
It is this strange conflict of interest with which this paper is most concerned. The state is forced to ensure a stable dollar, but it isn’t able to determine how—or for what—dollars enter society. So while much of the discussion surrounding the Green New Deal concerns ending or reigning in capitalism, there has been precious little discussion on ending or reigning in the commercial banking industry’s money-creation power.
While capitalism is often thought of as the private accumulation of surplus, the manner in which that accumulation is enabled is often ignored. Commercially created money means that production surpluses remain within the private sector. Were the state to take back the power to create money, and the seigniorage benefit that comes with such creation, it would severely limit the extent to which the private sector could accumulate surplus. In fact, nationalizing money creation would align the right of the state to create money with the responsibility it bears to manage money’s stability.
Perhaps most importantly, by regaining the monetary prerogative, the state could influence the direction of the economy by spending and lending money into existence in accordance with its goals. In the case of the Green New Deal, these goals would be social justice and environmental sustainability. This would mean that the tenets of the Green New Deal—from healthcare and education to healthy food and sustainable energy—would become structural components of a just and sustainable economy and not simply regulatory mechanisms of an extractive capitalism.
The Green New Deal, as currently written, is an end-of-pipe regulatory framework that relies upon taxing bank-created money to finance social and environmental spending.
This is a huge difference! By avoiding a discussion of a nationalized money supply, the Green New Deal, as currently written, is an end-of-pipe regulatory framework that relies upon taxing bank-created money to finance social and environmental spending. A nationalized money supply would transform government spending into the monetary creation mechanism and embed justice and sustainability as hallmarks of how we manage our national economy.

I'm loving what Kermit Erasmus is doing for Pirates and Bafana.
We managed to catch up with Klate, Lekgwathi & Erasmus at full time to get their 1st impressions of Klate: It takes some getting used to. It's very light, much lighter than the last ball we used. Lucky Lekgwathi: For me it was ok, I think my biggest challenge was the pitch. In the 1st half we had to be very careful at the back in our box. Kermit Erasmus: The jury is still out, the more we play with it the sooner we will get used to it. It moves a lot in the air. RDS: We played in patches & looked very scrappy. They are a physical, hard running side. We are happy with the 3 points. RDS: I agree with Sammy, we had a good chance when the ball fell to Oupa, I feel though we should have killed the game off sooner still. RDS: We are looking forward to the break. It's been a crazy 4 months. This is our 24th match I think. RDS: We have the last game on Sunday then prepare for the 23rd January 2014 against AmaZulu away, as things stand. We try keep that level of complacency from creeping in after we score. But at ...

Top 10 Trending Bafana Players Khune As 2013 winds down, Google have revealed the top trending Bafana Bafana players on Google search for the year and it comes as no surprise that Kaizer Chiefs and Bafana Bafana captain Itumeleng Khune tops the list. Khune has been in the media for his outstanding double winning campaign with Amakhosi, where he scooped a number of top awards, including the PSL Player of the Season. The goalkeeper also went on to be named the SA Sports Star of the Year at the SA Sports Awards Ceremony. Orlando Pirates goalkeeper Senzo Meyiwa follows the Bafana number one after his string of fine performances which helped the Sea Robbers reach the final of the CAF Champions League.

De Sa relieved Pirates are off the bottom of PSL log Pirates remained in the relegation zone despite their sweet revenge over Platinum Stars, but De Sa is happy to be off the foot of the PSL log 17 Dec 2013 Following Orlando Pirates’ emphatic win over Platinum Stars on Monday afternoon, coach Roger De Sa congratulated man of the match Kermit Erasmus and the rest of the team. Pirates wrapped up the game inside the opening 33 minutes with three goals, and De Sa admitted that the heat made it difficult for them to maintain the same pace throughout. “Well done to Kermit, the guys played really well in the first half hour or so,” said De Sa after the game. “After that I think the heat took a lot out of the players and the pace of the game dropped, and we just had to see out the game,” he said. The 49-year-old De Sa expressed his delight at climbing the log as the Buccaneers now find themselves 15th on the log, but he wants his players to keep working hard especially with the games coming thick and fa ...
Orlando Pirates returned to form with a commanding 3-0 victory over Platinum Stars in their Absa Premiership clash at the Royal Bafokeng Sports Palace on Monday. The Buccaneers made a fast start to stun the home team, as goals inside the first 32 minutes from Thandani Ntshumayelo, Oupa Manyisa and Dlaine Klate gave them an advantage they never looked like relinquishing. Pirates coach Roger De Sa selected Kermit Erasmus for the striking role and it would pay off handsomely as the nippy forward had a hand in all three of their goals. Despite reports in the media last week that Ghana international goalkeeper Fatau Dauda would be involved in some form for Pirates, he was again left out of the match-day 18 with Senzo Meyiwa starting and Brighton Mhlongo on the bench. Pirates gave an early warning of their intent when Ayanda Gcaba headed over

What are the two main rules for deadheading petunia plants
------------correct----------------------
covered in brown pods, you’ll have a bushy plant with constant blooms through the entire growing season.
Petunia Deadheading Info
Learning how to deadhead petunia plants is one of the simplest jobs in the flower garden. The basic petunia deadheading info consists of two rules: clip off the blooms once they turn brown and cut the stems directly above the next set of leaves.
This job is simple enough for school children to complete and often makes a good chore for kids to help in the garden. You can remove the blooms by pinching them off with a thumbnail, but it’s easier to use a pair of snips, scissors, or garden shears. Little gardeners can even use their safety school scissors, turning them into their very own first gardening tool.
Follow the stem down to a pair of leaves and clip it right above. The plant will bush out, creating even more flowers than before.

Erasmus: We Have To Keep Pushing Absa Premiership Orlando Pirates Kermit Erasmus Orlando Pirates striker, Kermit Erasmus, admits he wasn’t taking his chances in front of goal prior to his brace against Mamelodi Sundowns on Wednesday evening. A brace from the Bafana Bafana international, combined with a goal from Lehlohonolo Majoro, saw the Buccaneers to a convincing 3-0 win, their first in the league. Erasmus, who was handed the Man of the Match accolade, said his team will look to push on and continue with their fine goal scoring form. “The past few league games I haven’t been converting the chances we have been creating, but that is football,” said Erasmus. “It is not about the amount of chances you miss, but it is about the chances you score. “For me as a striker I just have to keep pushing and keep believing a chance will come and I will score, and against Sundowns I scored two goals and I am happy about that. “I am happy for the team and happy for the three points.

Mabokgwane backs Aces for league title 22 October 2014, 09:59 With another victory under the belt, Mpumalanga Black Aces intend to put up a worthy fight in the race for the Premiership title, goalkeeper Jackson Mabokgwane has warned. Mabokgwane was named Man of the Match in his side's 2-1 win over Orlando Pirates in Nelspruit on Tuesday night, producing fine saves in the second half to deny Kermit Erasmus and Thabo Qalinge. "We just play every game the same way. We don't plan for any team a special way because every game is three points," Mabokgwane said. "But the coach (Clive Barker) told us, 'If you win this game you're going to go up the log and challenge'. People said he was crazy, but we love the coach, he encourages us and we're happy to have him." Aces stretched their unbeaten run to six straight league matches, climbing from ninth place in the standings to second position, though they remained nine points behind runaway leaders Kaizer Chiefs, while Pirates dropped to third place ahead of the remai ...

------------answer-----------------------
AMERICA'S Next Top model has racked up an impressive 24 series, and it has a huge roll call of former judges to prove it - 22 to be exact.
Even Tyra Banks decided to give series 23 a miss. From Twiggy to Janice Dickinson, these are the stars you forgot judged the modelling talent show since it began in 2003 - and what the show's famous names are doing now...
Janice Dickinson (series 1-4)
Supermodel Janice, 63, was a judge on the first four series of ANTM, and appeared as a guest judge for four cycles thereafter.
The mum-of-two was known for her tough critiques, and Tyra fired her as a result.
Janice later said: "I was just telling the truth and I was saving these girls from going out there and being told that they're too short, too fat, their skin's not good enough.
"I was to America's Next Top Model what Simon Cowell is to American Idol."
She was given her own show, The Janice Dickinson Modelling Agency, from 2006-08, but this was nowhere near as successful as Tyra's one.
Janice, who's been married four times, went on to star in I'm A Celeb, in 2007, and the US version of the jungle reality show two years later.
She then went into the Big Brother house in 2015.
Twiggy (series 5-9)
After firing Janice, Tyra swiftly replaced her with model Lesley Lawson - better known as Twiggy.
The iconic 60s star, who's known for her signature big eyes, long lashes and short hair, went on to return to modelling with M&S in 2005.
The mum-of-one, 68, also released an album, called Romantically Yours, in 2011.
Paulina Porizjova (series 10-12)
Twiggy's replacement was Czech-born Swedish model and actress Paulina Porizjova, now 53.
She smashed into the spotlight at the age of 18, when she became the first woman from Central Europe to earn a Sports Illustrated cover.
Paulina, too, was fired from the show - claiming producers said she had an "ego problem" when she complained about Tyra's reported lateness to set.
She went on to guest star as herself in Desperate Housewives, and appear in a couple of documentaries.
Andre Leon Talley (series 14-17)
Andre Leon Talley is a big name in fashion, after working as Vogue's editor-at-large between 1998 and 2013.
The 68-year-old racked up four series of ANTM in two years, before leaving the show (and Vogue) to serve as international editor for Russian Numero.
The job wasn't a success, and Andre resigned after 12 issues.
Kelly Cutrone (series 18-22)
People's Revolution founder Kelly Cutrone, 52, became a household name when she appeared in The Hills and The City with Lauren Conrad and Whitney Port, between 2008 and 2009.
The expert fashion publicist then replaced Andre on ANTM - and swiftly disappeared from the public eye when she left the show.
Rita Ora (series 23)
With only one series on ANTM, it's easy to forget Rita Ora once hosted the show

c improvisation in the new Toyota Tundra. The aerodynamic will influence the exterior pieces and also the size. It is better to always make this car looks strong and big because it is truck vehicle type. Third, there will be new direct injection too in this car but Toyota doesn’t give detail information about it. Fourth, Toyota Tundra will be completed with engine stop and start because Toyota will not use it in 2014 Toyota Tundra.
Recommended Changes for 2015 Toyota Tundra
When it is clear that Toyota will do some changes above in their new Toyota Tundra, some people still want that Toyota also considers of some other parts that also influence the car performance. Some experts then recommend Toyota to change some parts such as: First the variable valve lifts. Toyota better changes the old valve timing with variable valve lift. Second, Toyota better changes the hydraulic steering with the electric steering system that is more efficient that the old steering system. Third, Toyota needs to use the best powertrain engine system that is more effective for their future car. We will know whether Toyota will change some parts above or not. We just can wait until Toyota releases 2015 Toyota Tundra to the market.
Toyota must work hard to make best 2015 Toyota Tundra by doing some changes in technical specification and also designs.

g to see the success of the first projects at Cranbrook now being extended to other developments including the Science Park, confirming and reinforcing the environmental and economic benefits of the approach. It is partnership working at its best.”
Colin Molton, HCA Executive Director for the South and South West, said: “This is great news for Exeter and East Devon and further evidence of the Government’s commitments to support schemes that can meet its aspirations for housing and economic growth. “There is work to be done to finalise these bids, which we will look to complete as quickly as possible. We are really pleased that Exeter and East Devon are once again leading the way in turning ambitious plans for a stronger economy into reality.”
Jeremy Bungey, Head of Community Energy at E.ON, said: “The Growth Point and its partners across the region deserves real congratulations, not only for bringing the Cranbrook and Skypark developments off the drawing board and into a real, sustainable community, but also for looking to build on that success to help deliver more efficient and lower carbon energy sources elsewhere in the city.”
The pipe work and related infrastructure for the district heating scheme would be put in place in line with building progress on site, meaning that new homes and businesses can be ‘plumbed in’ to the network as they are being constructed.

top safely. I’ve seen too many kids plow through crowds or other horses in warm up pens, and it’s just flat dangerous.”
2. Lost interest. “I’ve seen kids lose interest because they were too scared when put on a horse that was way too much for them time and time again. It’s like Little League parents putting their kid in a division they’re not ready for. They get hit with a line drive or a pitch and boom, they never want to play again.”
[SHOP KIDS’ MOTIVATION: “The Boy Who Never Gave Up” Stephen Curry’s Children’s Motivational Book]
3. Setting the bar too high. “I’ve also seen junior rodeo parents spend everything they have for their kids in the 12-and-under division to have a $30,000 horse. That horse won’t last forever, and now your kid is used to the best horse there is. Will you have $60,000 to move your child up to the next great horse at that point? Because it will be hard to lower their expectations when they’re used to the best. Plus, those kids aren’t learning how to ride one and make one early on. I’m not saying kids should be on broncs by any means, but there’s something to be said for working at it on something that isn’t 100% NFR caliber right off the bat.”
The biggest rule to follow when looking for a kid’s horse is making sure your child can stay in control at all times.
“That means tied to the trailer, in the warm-up pen, in the arena, on the trail, wherever they are,” Branquinho said. “Just don’t live through your kids by putting them on too much horse. This is supposed to be fun for everybody.” H&R

Colin Molton, HCA Executive Director for the South and South West, said: “This is great news for Exeter and East Devon and further evidence of the Government’s commitments to support schemes that can meet its aspirations for housing and economic growth. “There is work to be done to finalise these bids, which we will look to complete as quickly as possible. We are really pleased that Exeter and East Devon are once again leading the way in turning ambitious plans for a stronger economy into reality.”
Jeremy Bungey, Head of Community Energy at E.ON, said: “The Growth Point and its partners across the region deserves real congratulations, not only for bringing the Cranbrook and Skypark developments off the drawing board and into a real, sustainable community, but also for looking to build on that success to help deliver more efficient and lower carbon energy sources elsewhere in the city.”
The pipe work and related infrastructure for the district heating scheme would be put in place in line with building progress on site, meaning that new homes and businesses can be ‘plumbed in’ to the network as they are being constructed.

Routers were not designed to allow incoming network requests and some games can play tremendously better if an incoming connection is forwarded through the router to the game.
Before You Forward a Port
Before you can forward a port you need to know the following things:
- Your router's IP address.
- Your gaming

e church looking for help.
We can see this sign from the veranda, over the highway. This church building is right on the corner of two very busy streets, which is wonderful in so many ways.
Last Wednesday Gilberto came. Fabio wrote about him in the last post. Since then, others have come. Today, the man that “lives” next door came. There is a little plot of land on the other side of the church and there is a homeless man living there. We have been praying for him, and today he showed up here! Fabio and Claudio talked to him, gave him some food, and the guy invited Fabio to come visit him there in his cardboard shack! Fabio plans to go tomorrow.
Fabio is really excited to see God doing this work and to be a part of it. It is exciting for me too, and I love seeing how Fabio is coming alive as he fulfills what God is calling him to. He shows so much love and care to these guys that come in here, and you can see how much it touches them. No one else wants to touch them! Fabio says he doesnt mind the smell of alcohol too much, but is still asking for grace to withstand the strong smell of urine when he hugs them…. :-/
And hold back those stumbling to the slaughter.” -Proverbs 24:11
This is also part of our view from the veranda, and a target for prayer. This castle-looking building is the transvestite theatre I mentioned earlier. We now know it is all of that and more… We are praying for the devil’s work in this place to FALL; that the place would close down for lack of business, because those who frequent it now will come to know JESUS who will set them free from slavery to sin!! I personally am shocked at the change in my own heart, that can only be from the Lord. Previously, I was just repulsed by this particular variety of sin, but now I find myself being drawn to these people, our transvestite neighbors particularly, full of compassion for them as they are lost and dying without Jesus.
A MORNING OFF
This morning we had our first morning off since we came here, and a guy from the church picked us up and took us to the beach. It was really nice! Although not very far away from where we are living, it seems like a different world. It is, really. That is where the rich live, and there are high rise apartments lining the beach front. It is a growing area, with many building still going up and the city expanding on both sides of the beach front. There are a lot of foreigners investing here, because the real estate value is increasing by 20-30% every year! And there is still alot of undeveloped area both to the north and south, all along the beautiful and mountainous beaches.
THE PETI SCHOOL
I am teaching English now at the Peti school on Friday afternoons and on Monday mornings, for two hours each day. My first class is of 7-10 year olds, and the second class is of 11-14 year olds. I have enjoyed the teaching and the children, and getting to talk to another teacher and the director. I am also able to take my kids with me, and I have been taking Joshua and Dominique, one at a time. It is a great opportunity for them to learn about a lot of things – with me right by their side to guide the learning process.
This school is not the “main” school for the children. The way school works here in Brazil, there are two shifts at school: 7am-noon and 1pm to 6pm. It may vary somewhat by school, but that is the basic schedule, and you can choose whether you want to send your children in the morning or the afternoon. Well, in the favela, during the hours that the children are not in school, they are on the streets and generally up to no good. Most of them have homes, but not very good ones. They are typically neglected and/or abused and would rather spend their time on the streets than at home. Most of their parents are drug users, drinkers, prostitutes, you name it. This is the favela:
The land in the favela is not bought. The people who live here are squatters that just try to build some kind of house with whatever materials they can find. They just build houses on top of houses at the edge of the city, into the mountain. Because these houses are without structure or foundation, they are not uncommonly washed away in landslides when it rains a lot.
So, the PETI school is a supplementary school for the children to go to during the hours they are not in school, to keep them off the streets. They can eat there, have recess, art classes and other “fun” stuff, and also receive help with their homework. Twice a week they even get surfing classes! Much of the help is volunteer.
I am praying about how these classes can get me INTO the favela – into their homes, their families, their lives. Teaching English is great, but if it stops there, what good am I really doing for them? What difference will it really make in their future?
In one of my classes, there are two boys that have declared themselves to be homosexuals – at ELEVEN years old!! There are several that are HIV positive, some have been picked up by the cops for drug usage – at seven and eight years old, and one of the girls is constantly offering herself to the boys. The teacher even saw her do the same to some men at a bar next door! She is ten years old and still has the body of a little girl. Imagine what her mother does for a living, and what she has seen at home, and cry with me. Better yet, cry out to the Lord for these children!
GUILHERME’S FLIP FLOPS
Remember our neighbor boy Guilherme from the last post? The day I took the picture of his flip-flop, he ended up forgetting them here. Joshua saw how thin they were, torn in the back, and the strap had broken and been repaired from the underneath. Joshua asked Fabio if there was some extra work he could do to earn some money to buy Guilherme a new pair of flip-flops. So, Fabio gave him some extra work, and he worked hard at it.
The next day we took him to the store and he used his hard-earned money to buy a new pair of flip-flops for Guilherme, the exact same style as his own flip-flops! Guilherme was so happy!!
One day I got home and went into the community kitchen downstairs and Guilherme was there. His face LIT UP when I walked into the room. Then he started singing (in Portuguese): “Singing, singing, singing to my Jesus! I threw away my sadness and sent it away from my heart!” I was impressed and asked him where he had learned that song? He said Joshua taught it to him. 🙂 They have been singing it together ever since. Joshua is taking seriously his position as a missionary and we are so thankful to see that. Here he is reading a book to Guilherme:
I know this is a long-mega-post – thanks for hanging in there with us! There is just so much going on here that I want to share with you all. Keep praying for us and thank you for your care and concern for us and the ministry here! We love you!

covered in brown pods, you’ll have a bushy plant with constant blooms through the entire growing season.
Petunia Deadheading Info
Learning how to deadhead petunia plants is one of the simplest jobs in the flower garden. The basic petunia deadheading info consists of two rules: clip off the blooms once they turn brown and cut the stems directly above the next set of leaves.
This job is simple enough for school children to complete and often makes a good chore for kids to help in the garden. You can remove the blooms by pinching them off with a thumbnail, but it’s easier to use a pair of snips, scissors, or garden shears. Little gardeners can even use their safety school scissors, turning them into their very own first gardening tool.
Follow the stem down to a pair of leaves and clip it right above. The plant will bush out, creating even more flowers than before.

2 houses in less than five days. The epic building program, which is part of the 2003 Jimmy Carter Work Project, brought together 24 Juniata students with 51students from four other colleges: Washington University in St. Louis, Mo.; St. Francis University in Loretto, Pa; Valparaiso University in Valparaiso, Ind.; and the University of South Dakota. The program seeks to help eliminate substandard housing in Lowndes County, Ga. through the construction of 35 new habitat homes.
The students built frames for interior walls, which were transported to a separate building site in Valdosta. "We didn't work together as a single Juniata group so it was a great experience learning to work as teams with workers from different places," says Matt Humphrey, a senior from Phillipsburg studying information technology and co-president of Juniata's Habitat for Humanity club.
Another constructive spring break trip gave 17 Juniata students a chance to travel to Asheville, N.C. to work at Eliada Homes, a state orphanage. Together with six students from Elizabethtown College, the group put together and installed playground equipment and painted the school's gymnasium and other buildings.
"Many times at college I feel like I am focused on myself, my grades, and what is going on in my life," says Emily O'Donnell, a freshman from Royersford, Pa. "This spring break trip gave me the opportunity to serve others and make a difference."
The project also branched out into the surrounding community. The students cleaned a section of Reynolds Creek, a polluted tributary of the French Broad River. The team removed 12 refrigerators, 30 car tires, car batteries and several tons of smaller trash items from the banks of the creek. The students also worked at MANNA, a second harvest food bank that gleans fruits and vegetables from harvested farm fields. The students helped glean and organize foods, so donated items could be sent to local soup kitchens.
"The students were willing to volunteer their time but as the week went on they also were able to ask deeper questions about what conditions produced some of the projects we were working on," says Hillary Sherman, PACC-Americorps VISTA coordinator, who led the group on their trip.

------------question-----------------------
What led to J Alexander being fired from ANTM
------------correct----------------------
.
Tyra left the reigns to the 27-year-old singer last year, but soon decided she wanted to return - leaving Rita out of a job.
She ducked out graciously though, tweeting for her fans to welcome Tyra back.
J Alexander (series 1-13)
Diva Miss J is a former model, who fell into runway coaching after being spotted giving his fellow catwalk stars tips backstage.
He went on to coach supermodel Naomi Campbell and Kimora Lee Simmons, who also judged series 1 of ANTM, as well as Tyra herself.
J coached Tyra's wannabe models for four series before she made him a panellist.
He got his nickname from cycle 1 contestant Robin Manning, who often confused him with fellow judge Jay Manuel - and used to call him 'Miss J' because of his flamboyant outfits.
Miss J still appeared on the show up until the end of series 18, as a runway coach, but then was fired because of the show's plummeting ratings. Nigel Barker and Jay also got the chop.
J handmade all of his clothes on ANTM - with the exception of one nurse's outfit.
He previously revealed: "All the dresses that you see me wear at the challenges, I actually sit down with a needle and thread, not even with a sewing machine, and make them all by hand.
"I made the ruffles and everything."
J has a son called Boris, with his ex-boyfriend. He now splits his time between Paris, France and New York - and published a book in 2010.
Nigel Barker (series 2-18)
British photographer Nigel Barker was a familiar face on ANTM for eight years - until budget cuts saw him sent packing.
The 46-year-old originally wanted to study medicine, but fell into modelling when his mum, a former Miss Sri Lanka beauty queen, entered him in TV model search The Clothes Show.
The 6ft 4in hunk had a 10-year career in modelling before becoming a photographer.
After being let go from ANTM, Nigel went on to direct several acclaimed documentaries and did cameos on shows like Ugly Betty.
Since 2017, he's been a judge on Holland's Next Top Model, and its spin-off show Curvy Supermodel.
Nigel lives in New York with his wife, model and CoverGirl representative Cristen Chin, and kids Jack and Jasmine.
MORE WHERE ARE THEY NOW?
Jay Manuel (series 1-18)
Long before Drew Elliot broke the internet with Kim Kardashian's champagne glass Paper cover, Jay Manuel was the creative director on ANTM.
The 45-year-old featured on every series until his shock sacking - and went on to release a clothing line called Attitude with Sears Canada.
The esteemed make-up artist, who's worked as a stylist for Tyra, Naomi Campbell, Kim Cattrall, David Bowie, J-Lo and Rupert Everett, to name a few, launched Jay Manuel Beauty in 2014.
The brand's aim is to give an Instagram filter finish, without photo editing.
Jay was also a judge for the Miss Universe 2017 pageant and hosted Canada's Next Top Model.

maximum my study time. I also ask questions to my teacher when I have trouble with solving difficult problems. Fortunately, we finished extended essay in October, internal assessments for chemistry, biology, geography and math, and written assignments for English and Chinese. This leaves a plenty of time for studying final exams.

What priority has McNutt emphasized for reporting in Google Ad campaigns
------------correct----------------------
rders and workflow functions for Google Ad campaigns. “It streamlines the system,” said McNutt, “We used it before, but not as diligently.”
Reporting: More important than ever before
For McNutt, reporting has become a priority — making sure both team members and company stakeholders are aware of how campaigns are performing and the data being collected. He says an important factor that has now come into play is data-integration capabilities across the platforms they are using.
“The ability to centralize data into one place helps our team work more efficiently. This also helps us better manage our resources in terms of the footprint of our marketing stack,” said McNutt, “We try to optimize solutions and tools that work together and leverage the data they already provide so we can avoid building out a huge CDP.”
He says some data integration capabilities may not go as deep as a point solution would be able to go, but they definitely get the job done. The challenge now is being able to unify large volumes of data and make it functional.
“We’re looking at ways we can automate manual tasks and evaluating manual processes for improvement so we can extract the most value from current investments and resources.”
Instead of building out stacks, the new rule of thumb is efficiency: Consolidating platforms and taking full advantage of available integrations and add-ons for your existing marketing tools. That also means reaching out to your current list of vendors to find out if there are any features being offered free of charge or at a discounted rate during the coming months. McNutt said he’s currently giving TapClicks own tool away to existing customers for the next three to six months.

What are the critical viral proteins that messenger RNA must encode for a virus
------------correct----------------------
to direct the synthesis of viral proteins. The critical viral proteins that the messenger RNA must encode are those that coat the genome and those that help replicate the genome. One of the great surprises of modern virology has been the discovery of the variety of genetic systems that viruses have evolved to satisfy their needs. Among the animal viruses, at least 6 totally different solutions to the basic requirements of a virus have been found.

Recently, I attended a webinar that featured some useful (if not completely surprising) predictions derived from solid research. The webinar was presented by Maribeth Ross, the Chief Content Officer and a Managing Director with the Aberdeen Group. The topic of the webinar was "What Best-in-Class Marketers are Planning for 2015," and the content of the webinar was based on research conducted during 2014 in Aberdeen's customer-facing practice areas.
In this webinar, Ms. Ross focused on two major issues:
- What were the top challenges facing marketers in 2014?
- What are best-in-class marketers planning to do in 2015 to address these challenges?
According to Aberdeen's research, the top four pressures facing marketers in 2014 were:
- "We're not getting the most out of our marketing automation investment."
- "We know lead management is important, but we're not doing it very well."
- "Our buyers are doing more research on more channels before ever talking to sales."
- My sales team needs different resources due to this new buyer."
