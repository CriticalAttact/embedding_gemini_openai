for ‘essentials’
For me, there are times when buying these ‘prepared’ easy options are the difference between me being able to eat fresh and healthy food, rather than relying on ‘ready meals’ or jars of sauces. (Not that there is anything wrong with either of these; but I prefer making my own dinner)
My freezer always includes a bag of chopped red onions, my fresh food shop also often includes pre-cut fresh pineapple or melon.
Because chopping these myself would actually mean I would just go without

solved mainly caused by the pipe dimensions (up to eight inches) and placement almost 40 feet above the floor. The positioning and clamping of traditional metal pipe would have been extremely difficult and expensive, requiring the use of lift equipment. The plastic piping system solved these problems.
According to Enrico Rossetti, project manager for Frigo Tecnica Internazionale Spa, “The solution suggested by GF Piping allowed us to supply Lindt an efficient and modern system free from the disadvantages typically associated with black steel, such as the tendency to corrode, heavy weight and difficulty in welding pipes overhead.” Working with COOL-FIT ABS Plus was much easier, even in difficult situations, adds Rosetti. Employing the distribution piping system to carry cold glycol and warm water for the humidity control circuit allowed installation completion in a short time, considering that about 8,500 feet of pipe was installed to cool the entire 8-acre logistic plant in just three months.
The piping system is pre-insulated plastic specially developed for cooling applications. The carrier pipe is made from ABS, a material with excellent mechanical qualities, which can be used at temperatures as low as -40°F. ABS is also extremely light in weight; 3.2 ft. of 8-in. ABS pipe weighs just 25.5 lbs. versus 82 lbs. for the same length of steel pipe. Additionally, the cementing system for connection facilitates easy assembly of pipe and fittings, even in difficult conditions.For more information, 800-854-4090, or visit GF Piping.
EC extends time for machine builders to meet safety standards
Rockwell Automation is encouraging machine builders to comply with EN ISO 13849-1 as soon as possible. “Early adopters not only will move ahead of the competition, but also help better protect workers and machinery,” said Dan Hornbeck, safety market development manager, Rockwell Automation. “These new standards provide functional safety guidance that helps improve safety, efficiency and sustainability-while reducing development and operational costs.”
EN 954-1, formerly the main standard for the design of safety-related control systems in the machinery safety sector, traditionally has been followed for conformity to the European Machinery Directive 98/37/EC. Newer standards EN ISO 13849-1 or EN/IEC 62061-which provide for use of more advanced safety-control systems technologies-are in place, applicable now, and will fully replace EN 954-1 on December 31, 2011, says Hornbeck. At that time, the new control system standards will become the only ones accepted under the new European Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC. This widely anticipated change was first published in 2006, and the two-year period should be viewed as a transition period to comply with the new standards rather than as an extension of the old standard, according to Hornbeck.Many global manufacturers already specify compliance with the new standards, and Rockwell Automation is helping customers meet them with technologies, products and the necessary functional safety data, says Hornbeck. Functional safety data is available in multiple forms, including a data library for use with the SISTEMA calculation tool from the BGIA (Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the German Social Accident Insurance), and a PDF file providing data for manual calculation. Functional safety data, including the SISTEMA calculation tool and library, can be downloaded at the Rockwell Automation Safety Solutions Portal.

SaaS takes aim at universal food traceability
The software can deliver complete supply chain traceability information directly to the consumer’s mobile device. The baseline version of the application is free to all food chain participants-grower, produce supplier and consumer.
The ready-to-use, hosted software application enables growers to comply with the produce traceability initiative requirements while marketing their business directly to produce buyers, to connect with consumers directly about their food and to meet industry and government labeling requirements around traceability and country of origin.For more information, visit FoodLogiQ’s Web site.
Quality and safety of infant formulas, functional foods enhanced by new standards
The standards will be incorporated into a future edition of the FCC, published by the US Pharmacopeial Convention (USP), following a three-month period in which the scientific nonprofit organization will accept public comments on the proposals and consider any suggested modifications. FCC’s industry standards help ensure an ingredient’s quality for consumers as well as for food manufacturers who purchase the ingredient for use in their products.
Nucleotides are present in higher doses in human milk than in cow-based infant formulas-and are thus routinely added to infant formulas today. The three new nucleotide standards proposed for FCC inclusion are for disodium 5’-uridylate, 5’-adenylic acid and 5’-cytidylic acid. In addition to designating the identity, purity and impurities of the ingredients, the three new FCC standards include validated test methods that provide repeatable means of measuring the ingredients’ components.
The new standards being proposed for DHA oils are for DHA algal oil, Crypthecodinium Type and DHA algal oil, Schizachyrium Type. The first is used in infant formulas as well as for a wide variety of other products considered “functional foods,” such as soy milk and yogurts; the second is used for functional foods but not in infant formula. No other food compendium contains standards for these two ingredients. Supplementing formulas with DHA as well as arachidonic acid (ARA) is supported by the World Health Organization at levels of 0.35 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively. US infant formula manufacturers began to offer formulas containing DHA and ARA in 2002.Proposed new and revised FCC standards are open to any interested parties via the FCC Forum. Manufacturers, consumers and others are encouraged to visit the FCC Forum to review the new standards and provide scientific feedback. Comments will be considered by USP’s Food Ingredients Expert Committee, a group of independent scientific experts that oversees FCC standards. Comments will be accepted through March 31, and final standards will be published August 31.

How To Fix NET::ERR_CERT_DATE_INVALID Error On Google Chrome
There are several potential fixes for sites encountering an ERR_CERT_DATE_INVALID error in Chrome
The NET::ERR_CERT_DATE_INVALID error in the Google Chrome browser is a form of the “Your Connection is not private” error. If you’re seeing this error, it means that there’s a difference between your computer’s time and the validity of the website’s SSL certificate:
Is it OK to ignore the warning?
No, you shouldn’t ignore this warning or click to proceed. The error means that the internet connection or the device itself is preventing Google Chrome from loading the page correctly, Chrome thinks the page is insecure and poses you a threat.
Here’s what you should do to diagnose and fix this SSL error:
Start Here: Determine whether the issue is with the website or your computer
On the error page you’re seeing in Google Chrome, click on the “NET::ERR_CERT_DATE_INVALID” text to expand the warning, like this:
These two dates will tell you where the problem is that’s triggering the NET::ERR_CERT_DATE_INVALID warning on Google Chrome:
- Look at the “Current date”. Is that the current date? If not, skip down to the “Troubleshooting issues with your computer” section of this article.
- Look at the “Expires on” date. This date should be in the future. If the expires on date is today or earlier, that means the website has an invalid SSL certificate. Look at the “Fixing an expired SSL certificate” section of this article.
Fixing an expired SSL certificate
If the expanded security warning shows that the website’s SSL certificate has expired, you’ll need to install an updated SSL certificate on the website.
If you DON’T manage the website in question:
You’ll need to contact the website owners. Just send them:
- A screenshot of the NET::ERR_CERT_DATE_INVALID message you’re seeing
- The URL on their site that you’re trying to visit
- A link to this article
If you DO manage the website in question:
Good news, you can quickly and easily fix this issue to get your website easily accessible. Just follow these steps:
- Purchase a new SSL certificate. Here are a few quick tips on which to choose:
- If you just need basic HTTPS security, a basic DV certificate is likely all you need.
- If your website has different subdomains (eg www.mysite.com, blog.mysite.com, etc.) yo

tic one a car ride away.
It breaks my heart when Christians say they cannot come because our worship is too formal; our spirituality too ‘dead’; the place too much of a spiritual risk for their children. How will we change unless you come?
Going back to my school analogy, this was one of the hardest decisions we’ve ever made. But our local headteacher convinced us of her passion and her commitment and this month our daughter started at her school, within the estate. Yes, we will have to commit right back but this is no sacrifice. This is about exposing our daughter to the values that we hold dear, and I believe this can work for church too. As a minister I will commit to you, if you will commit to us.
It is likely to be hard work to go to your local church rather than one that ‘suits your needs’. If you are socially mobile, attending our church may feel sacrificial. If you are single, you are unlikely to meet the companion of your dreams here. If you are a parent, there is no weekly children’s or youth group. It may be you are not in a place to do this, you may genuinely be too vulnerable right now. But go and visit if you can.
I want you to go to your local church not just to ‘fix it’. Come and hang out in broken buildings with broken people. You’ll only get glimpses into glory but I have found those glimpses into people’s lives and God’s grace at work amongst the most meaningful in my life. You are likely to find the worst coffee you’ll have ever tasted and the warmest handshake you’ll ever receive.
Come join us; dare to love your local church

What event does 'Not the Same Sky' focus on regarding the Irish girls shipped to Australia
------------correct----------------------
By 1848 famine has ravaged Ireland, and London remains undecided about what to do. A shortage of female labour in Australia offers a kind of solution and so, over the following two years, more than 4000 Irish girls are shipped across vast oceans to an unimaginable world in the new colony. On Sunday 28 October 1849, one of these ships, the Thomas Arbuthnot, sets sail from Plymouth with a cargo of girls under the care of Surgeon-superintendent Charles Strutt.
Not the Same Sky tells the story of Honora, Julia, Bridget and Anne. It observes them on the voyage, examining their relationship of trust with Charles Strutt, and follows them from Sydney as they become women of Australia, negotiating their new lives as best they can. A st

What sentiments does the author express about their community and the church they serve in Birmingham
------------correct----------------------
I do not love the drug taking and dealing in the alleyway next to our house, nor the regular vandalism of anything we try and do in the area. But I do love the reckless abandon with which the young people dance on the roof of our church hall; the informal games of football on our front lawn and meeting six people on the way to the shops.
I am a recently ordained pioneer minister in the Church of England (this is a fancy title for – ‘you have permission to push some boundaries’). I live with my family in an outer estate in Birmingham with many of the pressures we find in our poorer communities.
And I love my church. We meet in a building held together by spit and Blu-Tack. One of the ugliest church buildings I have ever seen on the outside, the inside provokes gasps from visitors because it is, in contrast, beautiful. On closer inspection, you will notice it is filled with knick-knacks that each have a story, including the last vicar’s late mother’s dining room table; a much handed down pot of dry flowers; and two organs, of which only one works. This is a church, which perhaps like a grandmother’s front room, is well past its best but is loved and cherished.
Six months ago I walked back from an open day at our local primary school in tears; not because the school was terrible but because it was so good. It was not our local school and going to it would mean ‘commuting’ out of the area. It was a glimpse into the minds and emotions of people who are struggling to come to terms with a call to attend their local church, rather than the really fantas

THE COURTHOUSES OF WARREN COUNTY
In laying off the town a special provision was made for a central square, large enough to contain the courthouse, prison and stocks. We also know that a tax was levied on the county, the proceeds of which were to build the courthouse, the jail and the stocks. Miss Mordecai tells us in her History o f Hastings (Warrenton) that the first courthouse was a Dutch-shaped roof building. I have been unable to learn the date of the erection of the first courthouse. There is a painting of it by a Miss Summerville, perhaps a sister of John Somerville, that always hung in the home of that family. When the home was broken up Mrs. Hogue, the oldest daughter, gave it to one of the nephews, Ben Bronson. When he left the county he asked Tasker Polk to allow it to be hung on the wall of his law office, where it is now.
That painting represents it as greatly resembling the courthouses of early Virginia, with a small room in the center for the sitting of the Court, small wings on either side, all single roof with an outside chimney, and a large door in the center of the audience room, with a window on either side, but no steps leading from the door to the ground. It was evidently entered through a porch on the front of the northern wing. There were windows in the rear of the audience room, also 'a front window in each of the wing rooms. There was a well in the yard with a cluster of trees over it. In the southern corner of the court square the picture gives two gentlemen, standing conversing; I have been told that one is W. A. K. Falkener, the educator, the other Dr. Brehon, a well known physician of the town.
The second courthouse was built in 1853, a well proportioned building, handsome and imposing, with four large columns across the front, supporting the roof, on the edge of a broad stone porch. A wide corridor ran through the first floor, on either side were the offices of the Court officers. In the upper floor was a large auditorium, well ventilated by large windows on the north and on the south, in the rear of this courtroom were the two jury rooms, at the west end. Two broad stairways led from the lower floor to the large upper auditorium.
During the Civil War it was rare that a session of Court was held. It was in this courtroom that the ladies of the town were permitted to gather for the purpose of cutting out garments for the soldiers, which they would take to their homes and make with their fingers, there being no sewing machines at that time.
In connection with the courthouse of Warrenton, 1 recall several officers of the court, who through long and faithful service deserve special mention. Benjamin E. Cook, formerly of Petersburg, Virginia, came to the county in the early years of the nineteenth century, and settled in the town. He married a lady of the county, Miss Sallie Marshall, connected with the large and well known Hawkins family. Mr. Cook was elected as Clerk to the Superior Court of Warren County in 1830 and served until 1846. He was succeeded in the office by Mr. John W. White, 1847 to 1862. John White also served in the Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions nearly forty years. He was succeeded by his son, William A. White, in 1862, filling out the unexpired term of his father, ap

pointed by Board of County Commissioners.
W. A. White served as a deputy clerk to his father when only eighteen years of age, and was serving in that capacity when appointed to succeed his father. Due to changes in the Code, which were effected by changes in the Constitution, ho was made Superior Court Clerk in 1868, and continued to serve until 1905, when he resigned to Judge R. B. Peebles, in chambers, at Carthage, North Carolina.
Also in connection with the officers of the court we recall two sheriffs: Joseph Speed Jones, who served in that office for Warren County in the forties, and I presume until the election of Sheriff Jones in 1854 and '55, Robert H. Jones who was born in Mecklenburg County, Virginia, and came to Warrenton to live in middle life. He was a man of very fine appearance, a very handsome brunette, a tall and striking figure, with a high order of intelligence. It was said that he knew every family in the county and probably every voter. Throughout his official life he was as popular with the colored people as he was with the whites. He was impetuous, high-tempered and irascible, and had many enemies, although all of them voted for him; he had as well, numbers of devoted friends, who were actively his partisans at all times. He was retired from the office some years before his death, which occurred in Warrenton in 1890. As I said above, the negroes, with a few exceptions, cast their votes for Sheriff Jones either because they feared him, or because he was kind hearted and lenient in his dealings with them. As evidence of the former theory, there was a well known colored woman, Aunt Dicey Spruill, living in the town, a warm, shouting member of the Colored Baptist Church. The sheriff had threatened to put her in jail if she continued to create such noise and confusion in their meetings. On one occasion, when she became unusually uplifted and excited by the preaching she began to shout, at the same moment throwing off her bonnet and shawl, and waving her hand above her head, exclaimed, "Hold my shaker and hold my shawl and tell Bob Jones I am a shoutin' in the cool." For many years afterwards it became an oft repeated expression in the town and county.
For some years after the War Between the States there was a large law practice in Warren County growing out of the settlements of estates, due largely to the universal custom in most of the Southern States of paying debts of all kinds by note. In the unsettled condition then existing there was a large criminal practice, and quite a number of bankruptcy cases. As was to be supposed, these conditions drew quite a number of lawyers from the neighboring towns and counties, as well as large towns and cities, Richmond, Norfolk, Petersburg and Raleigh to attend the Warren Courts. Among those that made a regular custom of coming were Governor Bragg, B. F. Moore, General William R. Cox, J. B. Batchelor, Colonel T. C. Fuller, Judge Gilliam, Colonel L. C. Edwards, Mr. Lanier, Captain Joseph J. Davis, Captain W. H. Day, Edward Conigland, Thomas Hill, Charles M. and F. H. Busbee.

W. A. White served as a deputy clerk to his father when only eighteen years of age, and was serving in that capacity when appointed to succeed his father. Due to changes in the Code, which were effected by changes in the Constitution, ho was made Superior Court Clerk in 1868, and continued to serve until 1905, when he resigned to Judge R. B. Peebles, in chambers, at Carthage, North Carolina.
Also in connection with the officers of the court we recall two sheriffs: Joseph Speed Jones, who served in that office for Warren County in the forties, and I presume until the election of Sheriff Jones in 1854 and '55, Robert H. Jones who was born in Mecklenburg County, Virginia, and came to Warrenton to live in middle life. He was a man of very fine appearance, a very handsome brunette, a tall and striking figure, with a high order of intelligence. It was said that he knew every family in the county and probably every voter. Throughout his official life he was as popular with the colored people as he was with the whites. He was impetuous, high-tempered and irascible, and had many enemies, although all of them voted for him; he had as well, numbers of devoted friends, who were actively his partisans at all times. He was retired from the office some years before his death, which occurred in Warrenton in 1890. As I said above, the negroes, with a few exceptions, cast their votes for Sheriff Jones either because they feared him, or because he was kind hearted and lenient in his dealings with them. As evidence of the former theory, there was a well known colored woman, Aunt Dicey Spruill, living in the town, a warm, shouting member of the Colored Baptist Church. The sheriff had threatened to put her in jail if she continued to create such noise and confusion in their meetings. On one occasion, when she became unusually uplifted and excited by the preaching she began to shout, at the same moment throwing off her bonnet and shawl, and waving her hand above her head, exclaimed, "Hold my shaker and hold my shawl and tell Bob Jones I am a shoutin' in the cool."

What were the advantages of using the plumbing solution suggested by GF Piping compared to traditional metal pipes for the Lindt project
------------correct----------------------
solved mainly caused by the pipe dimensions (up to eight inches) and placement almost 40 feet above the floor. The positioning and clamping of traditional metal pipe would have been extremely difficult and expensive, requiring the use of lift equipment. The plastic piping system solved these problems.
According to Enrico Rossetti, project manager for Frigo Tecnica Internazionale Spa, “The solution suggested by GF Piping allowed us to supply Lindt an efficient and modern system free from the disadvantages typically associated with black steel, such as the tendency to corrode, heavy weight and difficulty in welding pipes overhead.” Working with COOL-FIT ABS Plus was much easier, even in difficult situations, adds Rosetti. Employing the distribution piping system to carry cold glycol and warm water for the humidity control circuit allowed installation completion in a short time, considering that about 8,500 feet of pipe was installed to cool the entire 8-acre logistic plant in just three months.
The piping system is pre-insulated plastic specially developed for cooling applications. The carrier pipe is made from ABS, a material with excellent mechanical qualities, which can be used at temperatures as low as -40°F. ABS is also extremely light in weight; 3.2 ft. of 8-in. ABS pipe weighs just 25.5 lbs. versus 82 lbs. for the same length of steel pipe. Additionally, the cementing system for connection facilitates easy assembly of pipe and fittings, even in difficult conditions.For more information, 800-854-4090, or visit GF Piping.
EC extends time for machine builders to meet safety standards
Rockwell Automation is encouraging machine builders to comply with EN ISO 13849-1 as soon as possible. “Early adopters not only will move ahead of the competition, but also help better protect workers and machinery,” said Dan Hornbeck, safety market development manager, Rockwell Automation. “These new standards provide functional safety guidance that helps improve safety, efficiency and sustainability-while reducing development and operational costs.”
EN 954-1, formerly the main standard for the design of safety-related control systems in the machinery safety sector, traditionally has been followed for conformity to the European Machinery Directive 98/37/EC. Newer standards EN ISO 13849-1 or EN/IEC 62061-which provide for use of more advanced safety-control systems technologies-are in place, applicable now, and will fully replace EN 954-1 on December 31, 2011, says Hornbeck. At that time, the new control system standards will become the only ones accepted under the new European Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC. This widely anticipated change was first published in 2006, and the two-year period should be viewed as a transition period to comply with the new standards rather than as an extension of the old standard, according to Hornbeck.Many global manufacturers already specify compliance with the new standards, and Rockwell Automation is helping customers meet them with technologies, products and the necessary functional safety data, says Hornbeck. Functional safety data is available in multiple forms, including a data library for use with the SISTEMA calculation tool from the BGIA (Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the German Social Accident Insurance), and a PDF file providing data for manual calculation. Functional safety data, including the SISTEMA calculation tool and library, can be downloaded at the Rockwell Automation Safety Solutions Portal.

Quality and safety of infant formulas, functional foods enhanced by new standards
The standards will be incorporated into a future edition of the FCC, published by the US Pharmacopeial Convention (USP), following a three-month period in which the scientific nonprofit organization will accept public comments on the proposals and consider any suggested modifications. FCC’s industry standards help ensure an ingredient’s quality for consumers as well as for food manufacturers who purchase the ingredient for use in their products.
Nucleotides are present in higher doses in human milk than in cow-based infant formulas-and are thus routinely added to infant formulas today. The three new nucleotide standards proposed for FCC inclusion are for disodium 5’-uridylate, 5’-adenylic acid and 5’-cytidylic acid. In addition to designating the identity, purity and impurities of the ingredients, the three new FCC standards include validated test methods that provide repeatable means of measuring the ingredients’ components.
The new standards being proposed for DHA oils are for DHA algal oil, Crypthecodinium Type and DHA algal oil, Schizachyrium Type. The first is used in infant formulas as well as for a wide variety of other products considered “functional foods,” such as soy milk and yogurts; the second is used for functional foods but not in infant formula. No other food compendium contains standards for these two ingredients. Supplementing formulas with DHA as well as arachidonic acid (ARA) is supported by the World Health Organization at levels of 0.35 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively. US infant formula manufacturers began to offer formulas containing DHA and ARA in 2002.Proposed new and revised FCC standards are open to any interested parties via the FCC Forum. Manufacturers, consumers and others are encouraged to visit the FCC Forum to review the new standards and provide scientific feedback. Comments will be considered by USP’s Food Ingredients Expert Committee, a group of independent scientific experts that oversees FCC standards. Comments will be accepted through March 31, and final standards will be published August 31.

The standards will be incorporated into a future edition of the FCC, published by the US Pharmacopeial Convention (USP), following a three-month period in which the scientific nonprofit organization will accept public comments on the proposals and consider any suggested modifications. FCC’s industry standards help ensure an ingredient’s quality for consumers as well as for food manufacturers who purchase the ingredient for use in their products.
Nucleotides are present in higher doses in human milk than in cow-based infant formulas-and are thus routinely added to infant formulas today. The three new nucleotide standards proposed for FCC inclusion are for disodium 5’-uridylate, 5’-adenylic acid and 5’-cytidylic acid. In addition to designating the identity, purity and impurities of the ingredients, the three new FCC standards include validated test methods that provide repeatable means of measuring the ingredients’ components.
The new standards being proposed for DHA oils are for DHA algal oil, Crypthecodinium Type and DHA algal oil, Schizachyrium Type. The first is used in infant formulas as well as for a wide variety of other products considered “functional foods,” such as soy milk and yogurts; the second is used for functional foods but not in infant formula. No other food compendium contains standards for these two ingredients. Supplementing formulas with DHA as well as arachidonic acid (ARA) is supported by the World Health Organization at levels of 0.35 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively. US infant formula manufacturers began to offer formulas containing DHA and ARA in 2002.Proposed new and revised FCC standards are open to any interested parties via the FCC Forum. Manufacturers, consumers and others are encouraged to visit the FCC Forum to review the new standards and provide scientific feedback. Comments will be considered by USP’s Food Ingredients Expert Committee, a group of independent scientific experts that oversees FCC standards. Comments will be accepted through March 31, and final standards will be published August 31.

Frequently asked (and answered!) questions (FAQ)
What was here before?About the propertyPreparing for constructionWhat is the CRC project?What are the impacts of the CRC project?Future
Q: What was the property used for before?
A: There is evidence that sometime prior to 35 years ago, the property was used as an apple orchard. When the previous owner purchased the property, he improved it for raising llamas.
Q: Was the pond always there?
A: The pond visible from Beavercreek Road and Ferguson Road was developed by the previous landowner. Interestingly, it is fed entirely by groundwater sources. The other pond was built by the previous landowner to capture runoff during the spring. He built a waterwheel to use the energy from the pond but that system remains unfinished.
Q: Why did the District choose this property?
A: The Clackamas SWCD chose to build on the already developed part of the property so that farm fields and open space would be retained. When the property was up for sale in 2013 it was marketed as a possible subdivision. The District’s purchase of the property prevented the loss of open space that would have occurred if a subdivision had gone in.
Q: How long have you owned the farm property?
A: The District purchased the property in 2013.
Q: How big is the property?
A: The Beavercreek Demonstration Farm covers 15.15 acres. This includes the footprint with buildings, the small woodlot, and the two ponds.
Q: Where is the small woodlot?
A: A small woodlot exists in the southwest corner of the property where a stand of Douglas fir trees provides habitat. The District has no plans to remove trees unless needed to maintain tree health.
Q: Why were buildings removed?
A: The Clackamas SWCD chose to build on the already developed part of the property so that farm fields and open space would be retained. To retain open space, the District had to remove old buildings that were not usable for a public agency.
Q: Couldn’t the buildings have been saved?
A: We offered the buildings to the local community, hoping that someone might want them. The cost of upgrading the structures to meet current building codes and to meet the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act was more than they are worth. The most prudent use of the public funds entrusted to the District is to remove those buildings. We are saving some of the most useful outbuildings. The District is committed to preserving the century-old barn. We have already invested tens of thousands of dollars to keep it standing. More work remains to be done!
Q: How can the District build an office on this site?
A: The site is zoned RA-2 which allows us to build through a conditional use provision specified in the Clackamas County zoning and development ordinances.
Q: What is the CRC project?
A: The Clackamas SWCD created a permanent conservation center to better serve our constituents in Clackamas County. We hope to also house the USDA Farm Service Agency and USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service so that the facility becomes a one-stop shop for our customers.
Q: How big is the building?
A: The new Conservation Resource Center is nearly 11,000 square feet in size. It includes space for the District’s employees and has a wing for use by partners. A 1,500-square-foot meeting room is included in the facility.
Q: Are there pictures available?
A: Yes! Hover over the Conservation Resource Center menu choice to see month-by-month photo sets.
Q: Is the District the only tenant in the building?
A: At this time, yes. We hope to be able to bring our federal partners into the space so that we can provide “one-stop shopping” to our customers.
Q: How long did the project take?
A: The District purchased the property in 2013. Active planning for the project began in 2017. Financing and permitting occurred in 2018. Construction started in February 2019 and was la

------------question-----------------------
What is the reason the author considers UNICORN BY SINFUL COLORS to be the worst nail polish ever
------------correct----------------------
mond using Pure Ice SUPERSTAR! and a black diamond in the center using Sinful Colors Black on Black.
And that would be it, except I just have one small thing to add: UNICORN BY SINFUL COLORS IS THE WORST NAIL POLISH EVER! It’s streaky, gloopy and if you’re not careful it bubbles like it’s nobody’s business! Not to mention, this polish STAINS! Oh god, does it stain! I made a joke about my nails being yellow now, but just you wait tomorrow morning they’ll make me look like I have a disease! Don’t get me wrong, the color is absolutely beautiful (it looks like a baby chick), the price is great, and most Sinful Colors nail polishes have great application, but I’m starting to wonder if it’s worth all the trouble. This is why I need your recommendations. What’s your favorite pastel yellow color that doesn’t streak like a drunk dude at a high school graduation?
Nailed It or Failed It? What’s your favorite yellow pastel? What’s the worst nail polish you own? Have you ever gone streaking? You don’t have to answer that last one. Hahahaha

------------answer-----------------------
rgely completed by the end of December 2019.
Q: Why do you have a gate on the driveway?
A: On behalf of Clackamas County taxpayers, we need to protect the assets in our care. A gate is one way to help achieve this when the office is closed.
Q: How much will this cost?
A: The total cost of construction is projected to be $5.7 million, including site preparation. Project funding is through a loan to the District.
Q: How does this save taxpayer money?
A: Once the building loan is paid off the cost of maintaining the property will be far less than projected leasing costs. The money saved will be used to expand services to people in the Clackamas County community.
Q: Did you have to remove the old farmhouse?
A: We miss the old farmhouse, too. As explained above, we did have to remove it. We replaced the white fence on the driveway with a new white fence. We saved some of the trees along the driveway and planted new ones. We replaced the old flagpole with two modern flagpoles. We also retained most of the open space that was available and we are committed to maintaining the old wood barn.
Q: How has the community been informed of this activity?
A: We have discussed this many times at Hamlet of Beavercreek meetings. It has been featured in the Beavercreek Bulletin and in Pamplin Media newspapers. We have presented our plans during events held at the site. It has also been featured on our website. As part of the conditional use process, neighbors were contacted by Clackamas County for their comments.
Q: Won’t it be noisy? What about extra traffic?
A: We don’t expect that activities at the new facility will be any noisier than before. A traffic study showed no significant impact to existing traffic on Beavercreek Road.
Q: What about light at night?
A: We are currently programming the lighting system. Right now, lights go off at 10 pm and come on again at 6 am. This may change as we fine-tune the automated lighting system.
Q: Why were trees along the driveway removed?
A: We had to remove trees to widen the driveway to accommodate emergency and service vehicles. We have planted replacement trees and look forward to seeing them grow!
Q: Will the space compete with that offered by other organizations?
A: We encourage people to use the Beavercreek Grange for their meetings. Adding the District’s meeting space means more people may patronize local businesses. We also have our equipment rental program at the farm where we are able to provide equipment to farmers that is not available from local rental companies.
Q: Will the facility be open to the public?
A: We are a public entity and once construction is complete we will welcome visitors. The large conference room may be made available in the future for workshops and educational events. We will hold an open house for the community in 2020.
Q: Can I have my wedding at the farm?
A: The Clackamas SWCD does not allow wedding-related events to be held at the farm.
Q: What will the fields be used for?
A: For now, the fields provide open space and grass hay. There is ample room for additional demonstration projects. We look forward to creating demonstrations of various farm and ranch practices.
Q: Will you continue to hay the fields?
A: While the fields are in grass, we expect to continue to produce hay, but not every year. Removing the nutrients captured in the grass eventually depletes the soil of nutrients and carbon. Some years we will cut the grass and let it return to the soil.
Q: Will you have livestock on the farm?
A: We need to rebuild some infrastructure to have livestock on the farm. Someday, we hope to use livestock to help cycle nutrients and build better soil.
Q: How do I get more information?
A: Please use our contact form at https://farm.conservationdistrict.org/contact to reach us.

Why does the author prefer buying pre-cut food options like chopped onions and fresh pineapple
------------correct----------------------
for ‘essentials’
For me, there are times when buying these ‘prepared’ easy options are the difference between me being able to eat fresh and healthy food, rather than relying on ‘ready meals’ or jars of sauces. (Not that there is anything wrong with either of these; but I prefer making my own dinner)
My freezer always includes a bag of chopped red onions, my fresh food shop also often includes pre-cut fresh pineapple or melon.
Because chopping these myself would actually mean I would just go without

------------question-----------------------
What was the primary reason for the lack of government response to the Rockefeller Commission's recommendations on population growth control
------------correct----------------------
he too was prepared to deal. Nixon was reelected with the bishops’ support.
During the year that followed the presentation of the Rockefeller Commission Report, it became clear that there would be no further response to the Commission’s recommendations. In May, 1973 a group of pioneer population activists acknowledged this inaction and asked Ambassador Adolph Schmidt to speak with his friend, Commission Chairman John D. Rockefeller 3rd. They met in June, 1973 at the Century Club in New York City. Schmidt noted his own disappointment and that of his colleagues because no program had been mounted as a result of the Commission’s recommendations. What had gone wrong? Rockefeller responded: “The greatest difficulty has been the very active opposition by the Roman Catholic Church through its various agencies in the United States.”
In 1992, one Rockefeller Commission member, Congressman James Scheuer (D-NY), spoke out publicly for the first time on what had happened: “Our exuberance was short-lived. Then-President Richard Nixon promptly ignored our final report. The reasons were obvious—the fear of attacks from the far right and from the Roman Catholic Church because of our positions on family planning and abortion. With the benefit of hindsight, it is now clear that this obstruction was but the first of many similar actions to come from high places.”
None of the Commission’s more than 70 recommendations was ever implemented. It is most disturbing that the American people were kept in the dark about this undemocratic and unAmerican intervention by the Vatican. It simply was not considered newsworthy because the press chose not to make it so. I believe both Catholic and non-Catholic Americans would have strongly rejected such interference in the American democratic process had they been aware of it. The quality of life for all Americans has been diminished by this unconstitutional manipulation of American policy, undertaken for the purposes of protecting papal interests.
Excerpts from: Chapter 6: “Why Did our Political Will Fade Away?”
How Population Growth Control Threatens the Papacy
Why is the Catholic Church obliged to halt legalized abortion and contraception despite the strong wishes of Americans? When our government legalized contraception and abortion, it pitted civil authority against papal authority. The Vatican demands supremacy over civil governments in matters of faith and morals, but our government has rejected this concept. Thus, while the Church is saying that family planning and abortion are evil and grave sins, our government is saying they may be good and should be used. Obviously, most American Catholics are accepting morality as defined by the government and rejecting morality as defined by the pope. As a result, papal authority is undermined.
There are a number of Catholic countries in Latin America which have abortion rates 2 to 4 times as high as the U.S. rate. But the bishops ignore abortions there. Why? Because they are illegal abortions, not legal ones. They do not threaten papal authority! Only legal abortions do, because their legalization establishes their morality. Thus, the bishops take no significant actions to halt abortions in Latin America.
In Papal Power: A Study of Vatican Control Over Lay Catholic Elites, published by The University of California Press in 1980, Jean-Guy Vaillancourt, Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of Montreal, closely examines the sources of papal power and how it evolved. He found that papal authority is vital to the maintenance of papal power. This power is derived in significant part from papal authority. If the pope’s authority is diminished, papal power is diminished. However, some authority is derived from papal power and if papal power is diminished, then authority is undermined. The relationship is circular. Less authority means less power which means even less authority. With diminishing power, survival of the institution of the Roman Catholic Church in its present hierarchical form is gravely threatened. Thus, the very survival of the Vatican is threatened by programs of population growth control.
In his book, Persistent Prejudice: Anti-Catholicism in America, published by Our Sunday Visitor in 1984, Michael Schwartz summarized the position of Catholic conservatives on the abortion issue:
The abortion issue is the great crisis of Catholicism in the United States, of far greater import than the election of a Catholic president or the winning of tax support for Catholic education. In the unlikely event that the Church’s resistance to abortion collapses and the Catholic community decides to seek an accommodation with the institutionalized killing of innocent human beings, that would signal the utter failure of Catholicism in America. It would mean that U.S. Catholicism will have been defeated and denatured by the anti-Catholic host culture.
In April, 1992, in a rare public admission of this threat, Cardinal John O’Connor of New York, delivering a major address to the Franciscan University of Steubenville, Ohio, acknowledged, “The fact is that attacks on the Catholic Church’s stance on abortion—unless they are rebutted—effectively erode Church authority on all matters, indeed on the authority of God himself.”
This threat to papal authority was recognized decades ago by the Papal Commission on Population and Birth Control. The two tiered commission consisted of a group of 15 cardinals and bishops and a group of 64 lay experts representing a variety of disciplines. The Commission met from 1964 until 1966. According to commission member Thomas Burch, the pope himself, Pope Paul VI, assigned the commission the task of finding a way of changing the Church’s position on birth control without destroying the pope’s authority.
After 2 years of studying the dilemma, the laymen voted 60 to 4 and the clerics 9 to 6 to change the Church’s teaching on birth control even though it would mean a loss of papal authority because it was the right thing to do. The minority also submitted a report to the pope.
In 1967, two newspapers published without authorization the full texts of the Papal Commission’s report. Thus the world knew that a substantial majority of the double commission had recommended liberalization on birth control. The commission, of course, failed to find an acceptable way to accomplish this, and the result was the publication In 1968 of the encyclical, Humanae Vitae, which banned the use of contraception.
It was not until 1985 that Thomas Burch, in the 1960s a professor at Georgetown University and more recently chairman of Western Ontario’s Sociology Department, revealed to the world the real assignment of the commission. When Pope Paul issued Humanae Vitae, he admitted to the world that the Church cannot change its position on birth control without undermining papal authority—an unacceptable sacrifice. However, it was not until 1979, when August Bernhard Hasler published his book, How the Pope Became Infallible, that the world was given the text of the minority report which persuaded Pope Paul VI to reject the majority position. Hasler was a Catholic theologian and historian who served for five years in the Vatican Secretariat for Christian Unity. During this period, he was given access to the Vatican Archives where he discovered numerous documents, which had never been studied before, that revealed the story of Vatican Council I. Dr. Hasler died suddenly at age 43, four days after writing a critical open letter to Pope John Paul II and six months after completing the second edition of this book.
“The Declaration of Papal Infallibility” was a product of Vatican Council I, which preceded Vatican Council II more than a century ago, and was considered vital to the continuation of papal power. According to Vaillancourt,
During the Middle Ages and under feudalism, when the Catholic Church was a dominant institution in society, papal power grew in importance, relying often on force

he too was prepared to deal. Nixon was reelected with the bishops’ support.
During the year that followed the presentation of the Rockefeller Commission Report, it became clear that there would be no further response to the Commission’s recommendations. In May, 1973 a group of pioneer population activists acknowledged this inaction and asked Ambassador Adolph Schmidt to speak with his friend, Commission Chairman John D. Rockefeller 3rd. They met in June, 1973 at the Century Club in New York City. Schmidt noted his own disappointment and that of his colleagues because no program had been mounted as a result of the Commission’s recommendations. What had gone wrong? Rockefeller responded: “The greatest difficulty has been the very active opposition by the Roman Catholic Church through its various agencies in the United States.”
In 1992, one Rockefeller Commission member, Congressman James Scheuer (D-NY), spoke out publicly for the first time on what had happened: “Our exuberance was short-lived. Then-President Richard Nixon promptly ignored our final report. The reasons were obvious—the fear of attacks from the far right and from the Roman Catholic Church because of our positions on family planning and abortion. With the benefit of hindsight, it is now clear that this obstruction was but the first of many similar actions to come from high places.”
None of the Commission’s more than 70 recommendations was ever implemented. It is most disturbing that the American people were kept in the dark about this undemocratic and unAmerican intervention by the Vatican. It simply was not considered newsworthy because the press chose not to make it so. I believe both Catholic and non-Catholic Americans would have strongly rejected such interference in the American democratic process had they been aware of it. The quality of life for all Americans has been diminished by this unconstitutional manipulation of American policy, undertaken for the purposes of protecting papal interests.
Excerpts from: Chapter 6: “Why Did our Political Will Fade Away?”
How Population Growth Control Threatens the Papacy
Why is the Catholic Church obliged to halt legalized abortion and contraception despite the strong wishes of Americans? When our government legalized contraception and abortion, it pitted civil authority against papal authority. The Vatican demands supremacy over civil governments in matters of faith and morals, but our government has rejected this concept. Thus, while the Church is saying that family planning and abortion are evil and grave sins, our government is saying they may be good and should be used. Obviously, most American Catholics are accepting morality as defined by the government and rejecting morality as defined by the pope. As a result, papal authority is undermined.
There are a number of Catholic countries in Latin America which have abortion rates 2 to 4 times as high as the U.S. rate. But the bishops ignore abortions there. Why? Because they are illegal abortions, not legal ones. They do not threaten papal authority! Only legal abortions do, because their legalization establishes their morality. Thus, the bishops take no significant actions to halt abortions in Latin America.
In Papal Power: A Study of Vatican Control Over Lay Catholic Elites, published by The University of California Press in 1980, Jean-Guy Vaillancourt, Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of Montreal, closely examines the sources of papal power and how it evolved. He found that papal authority is vital to the maintenance of papal power. This power is derived in significant part from papal authority. If the pope’s authority is diminished, papal power is diminished. However, some authority is derived from papal power and if papal power is diminished, then authority is undermined. The relationship is circular. Less authority means less power which means even less authority. With diminishing power, survival of the institution of the Roman Catholic Church in its present hierarchical form is gravely threatened. Thus, the very survival of the Vatican is threatened by programs of population growth control.
In his book, Persistent Prejudice: Anti-Catholicism in America, published by Our Sunday Visitor in 1984, Michael Schwartz summarized the position of Catholic conservatives on the abortion issue:
The abortion issue is the great crisis of Catholicism in the United States, of far greater import than the election of a Catholic president or the winning of tax support for Catholic education. In the unlikely event that the Church’s resistance to abortion collapses and the Catholic community decides to seek an accommodation with the institutionalized killing of innocent human beings, that would signal the utter failure of Catholicism in America. It would mean that U.S. Catholicism will have been defeated and denatured by the anti-Catholic host culture.
In April, 1992, in a rare public admission of this threat, Cardinal John O’Connor of New York, delivering a major address to the Franciscan University of Steubenville, Ohio, acknowledged, “The fact is that attacks on the Catholic Church’s stance on abortion—unless they are rebutted—effectively erode Church authority on all matters, indeed on the authority of God himself.”
This threat to papal authority was recognized decades ago by the Papal Commission on Population and Birth Control. The two tiered commission consisted of a group of 15 cardinals and bishops and a group of 64 lay experts representing a variety of disciplines. The Commission met from 1964 until 1966. According to commission member Thomas Burch, the pope himself, Pope Paul VI, assigned the commission the task of finding a way of changing the Church’s position on birth control without destroying the pope’s authority.
After 2 years of studying the dilemma, the laymen voted 60 to 4 and the clerics 9 to 6 to change the Church’s teaching on birth control even though it would mean a loss of papal authority because it was the right thing to do. The minority also submitted a report to the pope.
In 1967, two newspapers published without authorization the full texts of the Papal Commission’s report. Thus the world knew that a substantial majority of the double commission had recommended liberalization on birth control. The commission, of course, failed to find an acceptable way to accomplish this, and the result was the publication In 1968 of the encyclical, Humanae Vitae, which banned the use of contraception.
It was not until 1985 that Thomas Burch, in the 1960s a professor at Georgetown University and more recently chairman of Western Ontario’s Sociology Department, revealed to the world the real assignment of the commission. When Pope Paul issued Humanae Vitae, he admitted to the world that the Church cannot change its position on birth control without undermining papal authority—an unacceptable sacrifice. However, it was not until 1979, when August Bernhard Hasler published his book, How the Pope Became Infallible, that the world was given the text of the minority report which persuaded Pope Paul VI to reject the majority position. Hasler was a Catholic theologian and historian who served for five years in the Vatican Secretariat for Christian Unity. During this period, he was given access to the Vatican Archives where he discovered numerous documents, which had never been studied before, that revealed the story of Vatican Council I. Dr. Hasler died suddenly at age 43, four days after writing a critical open letter to Pope John Paul II and six months after completing the second edition of this book.
“The Declaration of Papal Infallibility” was a product of Vatican Council I, which preceded Vatican Council II more than a century ago, and was considered vital to the continuation of papal power. According to Vaillancourt,
During the Middle Ages and under feudalism, when the Catholic Church was a dominant institution in society, papal power grew in importance, relying often on force

------------correct----------------------
u’ll want a wildcard SSL certificate.
- If your site is an ecommerce or financial site, you’ll want an EV certificate to enable the green address bar.
- Complete the validation process (commonly completed via email or by uploading a verification file to your website).
- Install the updated SSL certificate on your website. You can find step-by-step instructions for common website platforms in our SSL knowledgebase.

Troubleshooting issues with your computer
If you’ve determined that the ERR_CERT_DATE_INVALID is caused by an issue on your computer, try these steps to resolve it:
- First things first, check the Date and Time set on your computer, if these are wrong it probably explains how you got the ERR_CERT_DATE_INVALID error.
- Sometimes fixing this error is as simple as shutting down your browser and then restarting it. Other times a system reboot may work. However, there are a couple of instances where you’ll need to do a little more work to set things straight.
- Check your connection, if you’re connected to public WiFi or some other public network there’s a chance that your browser is right and you don’t actually have a secure connection. If that’s the case, stop browsing and resume when you’re on a more secure setup.
- Scan your computer with a trusted antivirus software, you may have malware of some sort that is causing the issue. Unfortunately we can’t provide you with info on how to fix every last piece of malware, but if your antivirus can’t, someone on the internet probably knows.
- Disable any third-party plugins you have running on Chrome. Sometimes these can cause unwanted problems.
- Clear your browser cache on Chrome. Click the menu icon, open History and select “clear browsing data.”
- Delete and then re-install Chrome. Sometimes this helps.
- There are a few other crazy fixes like bringing down your firewall or modifying network settings. Don’t do that. If none of these fixes work, the issue could be site-side. But don’t sacrifice your security to connect to one website.
We hope this helped you fix the “Your Connection is not private” error

What features characterized the first courthouse built in Warren County
------------correct----------------------
THE COURTHOUSES OF WARREN COUNTY
In laying off the town a special provision was made for a central square, large enough to contain the courthouse, prison and stocks. We also know that a tax was levied on the county, the proceeds of which were to build the courthouse, the jail and the stocks. Miss Mordecai tells us in her History o f Hastings (Warrenton) that the first courthouse was a Dutch-shaped roof building. I have been unable to learn the date of the erection of the first courthouse. There is a painting of it by a Miss Summerville, perhaps a sister of John Somerville, that always hung in the home of that family. When the home was broken up Mrs. Hogue, the oldest daughter, gave it to one of the nephews, Ben Bronson. When he left the county he asked Tasker Polk to allow it to be hung on the wall of his law office, where it is now.
That painting represents it as greatly resembling the courthouses of early Virginia, with a small room in the center for the sitting of the Court, small wings on either side, all single roof with an outside chimney, and a large door in the center of the audience room, with a window on either side, but no steps leading from the door to the ground. It was evidently entered through a porch on the front of the northern wing. There were windows in the rear of the audience room, also 'a front window in each of the wing rooms. There was a well in the yard with a cluster of trees over it. In the southern corner of the court square the picture gives two gentlemen, standing conversing; I have been told that one is W. A. K. Falkener, the educator, the other Dr. Brehon, a well known physician of the town.
The second courthouse was built in 1853, a well proportioned building, handsome and imposing, with four large columns across the front, supporting the roof, on the edge of a broad stone porch. A wide corridor ran through the first floor, on either side were the offices of the Court officers. In the upper floor was a large auditorium, well ventilated by large windows on the north and on the south, in the rear of this courtroom were the two jury rooms, at the west end. Two broad stairways led from the lower floor to the large upper auditorium.
During the Civil War it was rare that a session of Court was held. It was in this courtroom that the ladies of the town were permitted to gather for the purpose of cutting out garments for the soldiers, which they would take to their homes and make with their fingers, there being no sewing machines at that time.
In connection with the courthouse of Warrenton, 1 recall several officers of the court, who through long and faithful service deserve special mention. Benjamin E. Cook, formerly of Petersburg, Virginia, came to the county in the early years of the nineteenth century, and settled in the town. He married a lady of the county, Miss Sallie Marshall, connected with the large and well known Hawkins family. Mr. Cook was elected as Clerk to the Superior Court of Warren County in 1830 and served until 1846. He was succeeded in the office by Mr. John W. White, 1847 to 1862. John White also served in the Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions nearly forty years. He was succeeded by his son, William A. White, in 1862, filling out the unexpired term of his father, ap

THE COURTHOUSES OF WARREN COUNTY
In laying off the town a special provision was made for a central square, large enough to contain the courthouse, prison and stocks. We also know that a tax was levied on the county, the proceeds of which were to build the courthouse, the jail and the stocks. Miss Mordecai tells us in her History o f Hastings (Warrenton) that the first courthouse was a Dutch-shaped roof building. I have been unable to learn the date of the erection of the first courthouse. There is a painting of it by a Miss Summerville, perhaps a sister of John Somerville, that always hung in the home of that family. When the home was broken up Mrs. Hogue, the oldest daughter, gave it to one of the nephews, Ben Bronson.

Ch. Bukowski said that we are looking for people we would like to grow old with, but we really need to look for those with whom we would remain children.
One of the ways not letting me personally not to get old is curiosity and the desire to find at least one reason to be surprised, fascinated, and excited every day.

mond using Pure Ice SUPERSTAR! and a black diamond in the center using Sinful Colors Black on Black.
And that would be it, except I just have one small thing to add: UNICORN BY SINFUL COLORS IS THE WORST NAIL POLISH EVER! It’s streaky, gloopy and if you’re not careful it bubbles like it’s nobody’s business! Not to mention, this polish STAINS! Oh god, does it stain! I made a joke about my nails being yellow now, but just you wait tomorrow morning they’ll make me look like I have a disease! Don’t get me wrong, the color is absolutely beautiful (it looks like a baby chick), the price is great, and most Sinful Colors nail polishes have great application, but I’m starting to wonder if it’s worth all the trouble. This is why I need your recommendations. What’s your favorite pastel yellow color that doesn’t streak like a drunk dude at a high school graduation?
Nailed It or Failed It? What’s your favorite yellow pastel? What’s the worst nail polish you own? Have you ever gone streaking? You don’t have to answer that last one. Hahahaha

Zlatan Ibrahimovic was on target again as Milan beat Lazio 3-0 at Stadio Olimpico to derail their opponents’ Scudetto hopes.
Juve moved seven points clear at the summit with a 4-1 win over rivals Torino earlier on Saturday and Lazio were unable to close the gap in their game in hand.
Lazio had not lost in 16 home games since May 2019 but were two down at half-time – Ibrahimovic scoring a penalty after setting up Hakan Calhanoglu for the opener.
Ante Rebic added a third for Europe-chasing Milan in the second half as Lazio, without leading goalscorer Ciro Immobile, fell to just a second loss in 25 league matches.
Calhanoglu continued his good form since the restart by opening the scoring after 23 minutes, the midfielder’s strike deflecting off Marco Parolo to help it over Thomas Strakosha.
Ibrahimovic had a goal ruled out for offside but did not have to wait long to score from the penalty spot after Alexis Saelemaekers’ cross struck Stefan Radu’s hand.

Manuel Lazzari thought that he had started a second-half comeback when he drilled home, only for the offside flag to deny him, and further misery followed when Rebic added a third goal.
The Croatia international took Giacomo Bonaventura’s pass in his stride and swept past St

This is one of those posts that I can’t use my usual humour and sarcasm….. Although I will try!
There has been lots in the news of late about the dangers of ‘single use plastics’, straws and in turn packaged, prepared vegetables and fruits.
But what are often marketed to those with disposable income and little time are also an expense for someone for whom cutting up a whole cauliflower or pineapple could be problematic or energy consuming, when energy wasn’t a luxury, rather a commodity to be saved

What is significant about the match between the University of Pretoria and Chippa United mentioned in the text
------------correct----------------------
New boys Tuks and Chippa meet
The University of Pretoria and Chippa United will meet in their first ever top-flight clash in the Absa Premiership when they meet on Saturday evening at the Tuks Stadium, kick-off at 8:15pm CAT (SA, GMT+2). Live on SS4 and supersport.com
The match will be the first time the two clubs have met since their promotion from the National First Division in June and it has been put down as a battle between who is the better promoted side.
“I think everyone is looking at it to see who is better. We are obviously higher on the table but only Saturday can decide who is better,” Tuks striker Mame Niang said.
“Their [Chippa] draw to Pirates is a boost to them and that is good for them, but our confidence is high too. We are playing and we are looking forward to the game.”
The home side come into the game off a goalless draw to fellow university team, Bidvest Wits, and it is a result that has given them mixed emotions ahead of the encounter.
“We are a bit disappointed in the draw because we felt we were the better team. We didn’t take our chances and we need to improve on those problems,” added Niang.
“Myself and the others need to take them [the chances] more often. It is a positive that we had one point unlike our last time out [against Black Leopards].
“We have struggled at home but sooner or later it will come. We have been unfortunate at home, but we can’t beat ourselves u

What are some of the characteristics that identify ants, and how do they commonly invade buildings
------------correct----------------------
What are ants?
Ants invade properties throughout Boca Raton and Southeast Florida, and their small size allows them to quickly sneak into your building through tiny cracks and crevices. Ants are social creatures that live together in large colonies and are rarely seen traveling alone. Despite their range of colors and sizes, these insects are among the most identifiable with their three distinct body regions: head, thorax, and abdomen. They have antennae, chewing mouthparts, and six legs; only the reproductive members have wings.
Some of the most common species of ants living throughout our area of Southeast Florida include the following:
Big-headed ants are small and vary in color from red, brown, or yellow. The workers are classified as majors or minors. The minor workers' bodies and heads are proportionate in size, while the major workers' heart-shaped heads are much larger than the rest of their bodies.
These large ants are one of the most significant, home-invading species of wood-destroying insects in the United States. Carpenter ants are usually black, red, or a combination of those colors.
Crazy ants are most often identified by their behavior rather than by their appearance; workers move in an erratic, frenzied pattern – giving the impression that they are crazy and do not know where they are going. Crazy ants are dark brown to black in color and may also have a gray sheen.
These ants have a unique color pattern that makes them difficult to see. Their heads and thoraxes are dark brown and their abdomens are a pale yellow color, giving them a ghostly appearance.
"Sugar ant" is a term used to describe a variety of small ant species that commonly invade homes. These ants are typically black and are highly attracted to sweets and sugary liquids. Sugar ants' small size allows them to gain entrance to your property through any small opening.
Tropical fire ants
Tropical fire ants are a reddish-brown color and come in a variety of sizes, with the major workers having large, square heads. They are typically outdoor pests that create their nests in open, sunny areas.
These ants brown or black in color and are very small in size. As their name suggests, their feet are a distinctive pale color.
Are ants dangerous?
The good news is that most ants we come across are nuisance pests. Nuisance ants don't cause any significant harm, but their presence around your home should never be allowed. Ants contaminate food, introduce bacteria, and once established, can be very difficult to eradicate. Ants are potentially hazardous to people and property, depending on their species. Carpenter ants are dangerous because of the destruction they cause when invading and nesting inside structural wood. Tropical fire ants are a danger to people because they are an aggressive species and will defend their colony by delivering painful stings.
Why do I have an ant problem?
Ants are in your home or business because of the sources of food, water, and shelter they offer. They gain access to food and water from gardens, compost piles and trash cans, pet bowls, outdoor eating areas, and leaky outdoor fixtures; all

By 1848 famine has ravaged Ireland, and London remains undecided about what to do. A shortage of female labour in Australia offers a kind of solution and so, over the following two years, more than 4000 Irish girls are shipped across vast oceans to an unimaginable world in the new colony. On Sunday 28 October 1849, one of these ships, the Thomas Arbuthnot, sets sail from Plymouth with a cargo of girls under the care of Surgeon-superintendent Charles Strutt.
Not the Same Sky tells the story of Honora, Julia, Bridget and Anne. It observes them on the voyage, examining their relationship of trust with Charles Strutt, and follows them from Sydney as they become women of Australia, negotiating their new lives as best they can. A st

What were some of the potential benefits that Mumford outlined had the recommendations of NSSM 200 been implemented in 1975
------------correct----------------------
[ All of what follows is from the article below. Mumford makes the case that:
“Had the recommendations of NSSM 200 been implemented in 1975, the world would be very different today. The prospects would have improved for every nation and people to be significantly more secure. There would be less civil and regional warfare, less starvation and hunger, a cleaner environment and less disease, greater educational opportunities, expanded civil rights, especially for women, and a political climate more conducive to the expansion of democracy.”
In other words, we wouldn’t be 6.5 billion over the carrying capacity of the planet, and 235 million over the carrying capacity of the United States (~100 million). There’d be more ground water, fossil fuels would have lasted decades longer, there’d be less top soil erosion and pollution, less of the (rain)forest would be clearcut — really — can you think of a single problem that wouldn’t benefit from fewer people?
But hey, Nixon wanted to get reelected, and made a deal with the Catholic Church that he’d back off on population measures in exchange for more Catholic voters. Republicans have extended that deal to right-wing fundamentalists to remain in power.

Mumford, S. D. February 5, 2012. Excerpts from: The Life and Death of NSSM 200: How the Destruction of Political Will Doomed a U.S. Population Policy. Church and State.
“Editor’s note: Given this November’s U.S. Presidential election and the Catholic Church’s immense stake in the outcome, we are publishing a series of articles by our chairman Dr. Stephen D. Mumford, founder and President of the North Carolina-based Center for Research on Population and Security. The following article draws from selected passages of Dr. Mumford’s seminal book, The Life and Death of NSSM 200: How the Destruction of Political Will Doomed a U.S. Population Policy (1996). It reveals the anti-democratic and anti-American machinations of the Vatican that killed the United States’ National Security Study Memorandum 200 (NSSM 200) report and succeeded in destroying American political will to deal with the overpopulation problem. This article is as relevant and revealing today as it was when it was first published by Focus in 1998.
The 1960s saw a surge in American public awareness of the world population problem. The invention of the contraceptive pill in 1960 stimulated broad public debate on birth control and the need for it.
When Pope John XXIII created the Papal Commission on Population and Birth Control in 1963, he gave the world hope that the Church was about to change its position on birth control. After all, why would the Vatican study the issue if the Church was not in a position to change its teaching on birth control?
In 1968, Paul Ehrlich published his book, The Population Bomb, the most successful book of its kind, ever. That same year, the journal Science published one of its most controversial articles ever, an essay by Garrett Hardin titled, “The Tragedy of the Commons,” which sparked much discussion of the overpopulation threat.
Among mainstream protestant denominations, the Presbyterians were one of the first to call for a forthright response to the problem. In 1965, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) urged “the government of the United States to be ready to assist countries who request help in the development of programs of voluntary planned parenthood as a practical and humane means of controlling fertility and population growth.”
In 1971, it recognized that reliance on private, voluntary decisions: “will not be sufficient to provide the necessary limitation of population growth unless there is a radical and rapid change in the attitudes and desires. The Church must commit itself to effecting this change. The assumption that couples have the freedom to have as many children as they can support should be challenged. We can no longer justify bringing into existence as many children as we desire. Our corporate responsibility to each other prohibits this. Given the population crisis we must recognize and teach, beginning with ourselves, that man has an obligation to limit the size of his family.”
And in 1972, the Presbyterians called on governments “to take such actions as will stabilize population size…. We who are motivated by the urgency of over-population rather than the prospect of decimation would preserve the species by responding in faith: Do not multiply—the earth is filled!”
This kind of increasing out cry for action made it safe—almost compelling—for American political leadership to identify with the concept of population growth control and to call for new programs to deal with the problem.
It was in this climate of rising concern that President Nixon sent to Congress his “Special Message on Problems of Population Growth.” Special messages to the Congress are exceedingly rare and this was the first such message on population. This action punctuated the beginning of the peak of American political will to deal with the mounting population crisis. The message, for the first time, committed the United States to confronting the population problem. Also rare, this special message was approved by the Congress. Its passage was bipartisan, indicating broad political support for American political action to combat this problem. The message was a water shed development, yet few recall it.
The most important element of the Special Message was its creation of the Commission on Population Growth and the American Future. During the signing of the bill establishing the Commission, President Nixon commented on the broad political and public support: “I believe this is an historic occasion. It has been made historic not simply by the act of the President in signing this measure, but by the fact that it has had bipartisan support and also such broad support in the Nation.”
The 24 member Commission was chaired by John D. Rockefeller 3rd. It ordered more than 100 research projects which collected and analyzed data that would make possible the formulation of a comprehensive U.S. population policy. After 2 years of intense effort, the Commission completed a 186-page report titled, Population and the American Future which offered more than 70 recommendations. The recommendations were a bold but sane response to the challenges we faced in 1973. For example, they called for: passage of a Population Education Act to help school systems establish well-planned population education programs; sex education to be widely available for all, including minors, at government expense if necessary; vastly expanded research in many areas related to population-growth control; and the elimination of all employment of illegal aliens.
The recommendations represented the conclusions of some of the nation’s most capable people. The scientists who completed the Commission’s 100 research projects were among the best in their fields. These recommendations are included in this book because it is important for the reader to know what the U.S. response to the population problem could have been and should have been. On May 5, 1972, at a ceremony held for the purpose of formally submitting the Commission’s findings and conclusions, President Nixon publicly renounced the report. This was 6 months before the President faced re-election and he was feeling intense political heat from one particularly powerful, foreign-controlled special interest group—the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church. Nothing happened toward implementation of any of the more than three score recommendations that collectively would have created a comprehensive U.S. population policy. Not one recommendation was ever adopted. To this day, the U.S. has no population policy, one of the few major countries with this distinction.

p about it. We have to go out and win it.”
After a troubled start to the campaign the Chilli Boys have finally found some purpose under Farouk Abrahams- losing just one game in his five matches in charge.
His latest exposé was against the defending Champions, Orlando Pirates, where they managed to keep the Buccaneers at bay to hold them to a 0-0 draw.
“We play a high tempo game and sometimes the guys are going to cramp in the second half, but that is the risk we take. We don't play around in our half- we play a percentage football which is exciting,” the coach said after Wednesday night’s game.
“We play off the front man which means there are more goalscoring chances coming our way.
“I thought Pirates was confused in the first half and they didn't press us in our half at all which forced them to play it long. We play to our strengths and so far it is working.”
The draw has left the coach confident they can get a result in Pretoria, especially after seeing their goalkeeper Daouda Kassaly pull off some heroics against the Sea Robbers.
“We have Tuks next on Saturday and, you know, we think we can go there with this type of performance and take three points.
“Hats off to our goalkeeper Kassaly because I made him captain after our game two weeks ago against Ajax, where he made a couple of blunders. I made him captain and what a captain performance it was- I am very proud of him,” concluded the coach

What change did Nestlé make to their cookie dough process to enhance product safety
------------correct----------------------
Tech Flash Vol 6, No. 2 -- Food Engineering's E-Newsletter
Change in cookie dough process avoids contamination
“Consistent with our quality standards for Nestlé Toll House refrigerated cookie dough, this change will only further enhance the safety of our products,” said Paul Bakus, general manager, Nestlé USA Baking Group.
In June 2009, Nestlé
On January 11 of this year, Nestlé informed the FDA that two samples of the cookie dough manufactured at the
According to a Nestlé spokesperson, flour is a likely suspect in the contamination since it is a raw agricultural commodity, and raw ingredients can carry risk. The switch to heat-treated flour was made to improve product safety and minimize this risk.The process of converting to heat-treated flour began on January 13, and production with the new ingredient began January 25. Product made with the heat-treated flour is expected to appear on grocery store shelves in early March. Nestlé will continue its new protocol of testing ingredients and finished product.
New York City takes the lead in lowering salt levels
Excessive salt can be a major contributor to hypertension, stroke, heart and kidney disease and other ailments. Starting in 1978, CSPI has been urging FDA to treat salt, or sodium chloride, as a food additive, as opposed to classifying it as an ingredient that is generally recognized as safe (GRAS).
CSPI filed lawsuits against FDA in 1982 and in 2005 to try to compel it to take action, and later in 2005 filed a regulatory petition that asked the agency to set maximum levels of salt in various food categories. The agency held a public hearing in 2007 but hasn’t taken any action since.
“Reducing sodium levels in packaged and restaurant foods could save thousands of lives a year in
Seventy percent of the population-a group that includes the elderly, African Americans and people with existing high blood pressure-should consume no more than 1,500 mg of sodium per day, according to the federal government. Others should limit their intake to less than 2,300 mg per day.
In 2009, CSPI analyzed the salt content in several popular chain restaurant meals, finding several with sodium levels between 5,000 to 7,000 mg. A high scorer, for example, was Red Lobster’s Admiral’s feast with creamy lobster-topped mashed potato, Caesar salad with dressing, a complimentary Cheddar Bay biscuit and lemonade-topping out at 7,106 mg of salt-enough to satisfy almost five day’s-worth for those on the lower, restricted levels of 1,500 mg per day.CSPI found Chili’s Buffalo Chicken fajitas and Honey-Chipotle ribs with mashed potatoes, gravy and seasonal vegetables provided 6,916 mg and 6,440 mg sodium respectively, while two Olive Garden meals came in at 6,176 mg and 5,735 mg of sodium.
When a cereal bag is something else
The brigades will function as collection sites for post-use Malt-O-Meal cereal bags and help prevent a significant amount of packaging waste from going into landfills. Individuals or school groups can sign up to sponsor a brigade, with proceeds to benefit a designated school, school-sponsored club, or school-sponsored special interest group. There is no cost to start a brigade, and all shipping costs are paid. For each Malt-O-Meal cereal bag collected and upcycled through TerraCycle, the designated school will be paid $.02 from TerraCycle.To learn more about TerraCycle or to sign up to sponsor a Malt-O-Meal cereal bag brigade, visit TerraCycle’s Web site.
Databases: The perfect complement to PLCs
“You might ask how it is they’re even related. For one thing, RDBs can be [like] an extension of PLC memory,” says Hechtman. Live values can be mirrored in RDBs bi-directionally. Historical values and events can be recorded there as well. But operators and managers can interact with them too. “Over the last six years I’ve delved heavily into SQL and learned a lot about relational databases. I’ve discovered that working with SQL is remarkably similar to working with PLCs and ladder logic,” adds Hechtman.
SQL has four basic commands and about a hundred different modifiers that can be applied to each in various ways to achieve all types of results. Hechtman provides an example: Imagine effluent from a wastewater plant with its flow, pH and other things being monitored and logged. That’s what you typically see. But now associate these with other things: discrete lab results, the name of the persons who did the lab work, the lab equipment IDs and calibration expiration dates, who was on shift at the time and the shift just prior, their certification levels, what chemicals where added and when, who the chemical suppliers were, how long the chemicals sat before use and so forth. All of this becomes relational data, meaning that if it’s arranged properly in tables, users can run SQL queries to obtain all types of interesting results. The queries might provide insight into the most likely conditions that could result in an improper discharge so it can be prevented in the future.
“SQL is a high level language that isn’t very hard to learn, and you can be very clever with it,” adds Hechtman. He prefers to think of it as a natural extension of his PLC programming skills. SQL can be used to obtain or extract the history of a machine for the period it has been operating, and that history can be stored in a relational database. Furthermore, RDBs and SQL pull people and processes together. Machines don’t run alone. They’re merely part of a containing process, and that process was devised by people. SQL and relational databases form the bridge to integrate processes, machinery and people.
Hechtman doesn’t believe a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS ) software package can fit an application any more than a COTS palletizer program can fit into different food processors’ applications. Every machine is different and every business process is different. That’s where SQL comes in. It has to duplicate or augment existing process flows, and these are intimately connected to the machinery.To get started, Hechtman suggests picking up a “Dummies” type book. Then download and install the open-source MySQL database server along with the MySQL administrator and query browser. It only takes a few minutes to install, and then engineers can begin to experiment. “You can read about a LEFT JOIN or INNER JOIN, but typing one in and observing the results is worth about 1,000 words,” says Hechtman.

------------question-----------------------
What are the projected uses for the fields at the facility
------------correct----------------------
rgely completed by the end of December 2019.
Q: Why do you have a gate on the driveway?
A: On behalf of Clackamas County taxpayers, we need to protect the assets in our care. A gate is one way to help achieve this when the office is closed.
Q: How much will this cost?
A: The total cost of construction is projected to be $5.7 million, including site preparation. Project funding is through a loan to the District.
Q: How does this save taxpayer money?
A: Once the building loan is paid off the cost of maintaining the property will be far less than projected leasing costs. The money saved will be used to expand services to people in the Clackamas County community.
Q: Did you have to remove the old farmhouse?
A: We miss the old farmhouse, too. As explained above, we did have to remove it. We replaced the white fence on the driveway with a new white fence. We saved some of the trees along the driveway and planted new ones. We replaced the old flagpole with two modern flagpoles. We also retained most of the open space that was available and we are committed to maintaining the old wood barn.
Q: How has the community been informed of this activity?
A: We have discussed this many times at Hamlet of Beavercreek meetings. It has been featured in the Beavercreek Bulletin and in Pamplin Media newspapers. We have presented our plans during events held at the site. It has also been featured on our website. As part of the conditional use process, neighbors were contacted by Clackamas County for their comments.
Q: Won’t it be noisy? What about extra traffic?
A: We don’t expect that activities at the new facility will be any noisier than before. A traffic study showed no significant impact to existing traffic on Beavercreek Road.
Q: What about light at night?
A: We are currently programming the lighting system. Right now, lights go off at 10 pm and come on again at 6 am. This may change as we fine-tune the automated lighting system.
Q: Why were trees along the driveway removed?
A: We had to remove trees to widen the driveway to accommodate emergency and service vehicles. We have planted replacement trees and look forward to seeing them grow!
Q: Will the space compete with that offered by other organizations?
A: We encourage people to use the Beavercreek Grange for their meetings. Adding the District’s meeting space means more people may patronize local businesses. We also have our equipment rental program at the farm where we are able to provide equipment to farmers that is not available from local rental companies.
Q: Will the facility be open to the public?
A: We are a public entity and once construction is complete we will welcome visitors. The large conference room may be made available in the future for workshops and educational events. We will hold an open house for the community in 2020.
Q: Can I have my wedding at the farm?
A: The Clackamas SWCD does not allow wedding-related events to be held at the farm.
Q: What will the fields be used for?
A: For now, the fields provide open space and grass hay. There is ample room for additional demonstration projects. We look forward to creating demonstrations of various farm and ranch practices.
Q: Will you continue to hay the fields?
A: While the fields are in grass, we expect to continue to produce hay, but not every year. Removing the nutrients captured in the grass eventually depletes the soil of nutrients and carbon. Some years we will cut the grass and let it return to the soil.
Q: Will you have livestock on the farm?
A: We need to rebuild some infrastructure to have livestock on the farm. Someday, we hope to use livestock to help cycle nutrients and build better soil.
Q: How do I get more information?
A: Please use our contact form at https://farm.conservationdistrict.org/contact to reach us.

rgely completed by the end of December 2019.
Q: Why do you have a gate on the driveway?
A: On behalf of Clackamas County taxpayers, we need to protect the assets in our care. A gate is one way to help achieve this when the office is closed.
Q: How much will this cost?
A: The total cost of construction is projected to be $5.7 million, including site preparation. Project funding is through a loan to the District.
Q: How does this save taxpayer money?
A: Once the building loan is paid off the cost of maintaining the property will be far less than projected leasing costs. The money saved will be used to expand services to people in the Clackamas County community.
Q: Did you have to remove the old farmhouse?
A: We miss the old farmhouse, too. As explained above, we did have to remove it. We replaced the white fence on the driveway with a new white fence. We saved some of the trees along the driveway and planted new ones. We replaced the old flagpole with two modern flagpoles. We also retained most of the open space that was available and we are committed to maintaining the old wood barn.
Q: How has the community been informed of this activity?
A: We have discussed this many times at Hamlet of Beavercreek meetings. It has been featured in the Beavercreek Bulletin and in Pamplin Media newspapers. We have presented our plans during events held at the site. It has also been featured on our website. As part of the conditional use process, neighbors were contacted by Clackamas County for their comments.

New boys Tuks and Chippa meet
The University of Pretoria and Chippa United will meet in their first ever top-flight clash in the Absa Premiership when they meet on Saturday evening at the Tuks Stadium, kick-off at 8:15pm CAT (SA, GMT+2). Live on SS4 and supersport.com
The match will be the first time the two clubs have met since their promotion from the National First Division in June and it has been put down as a battle between who is the better promoted side.
“I think everyone is looking at it to see who is better. We are obviously higher on the table but only Saturday can decide who is better,” Tuks striker Mame Niang said.
“Their [Chippa] draw to Pirates is a boost to them and that is good for them, but our confidence is high too. We are playing and we are looking forward to the game.”
The home side come into the game off a goalless draw to fellow university team, Bidvest Wits, and it is a result that has given them mixed emotions ahead of the encounter.
“We are a bit disappointed in the draw because we felt we were the better team. We didn’t take our chances and we need to improve on those problems,” added Niang.
“Myself and the others need to take them [the chances] more often. It is a positive that we had one point unlike our last time out [against Black Leopards].
“We have struggled at home but sooner or later it will come. We have been unfortunate at home, but we can’t beat ourselves u

#31DNP Day 3 – IKAN’T Believe It’s Ikat!
I was thinking about posting my nails with no polish today as a joke (yes, they really are that stained), but I decided against it. You guys already have to look at my incredibly dry cuticles/hands so it would be cruel to make you look at my icky yellow nails! So instead of looking at my bare nails today you get some ikat print inspired nails. Aren’t they adorable?
This manicure was actually something I had been wanting to do after watching an ikat nail tutorial on youtube, but I just hadn’t gotten around to it. I really love the darker look in the video, but whenever I think of ikat print I always think of a cute yellow ikat skirt I saw on Pinterest forever ago so I wanted to recreate the look with a light yellow. I started with four coats of Sinful Colors Unicorn. You only need three coats to get full opacity, but this polish is so damn streaky that I needed a nice (bordering on) thick coat to even it all out! After that I just followed the directions in the video and made a white dia

What inspired the author's ikat print nails manicure

#31DNP Day 3 – IKAN’T Believe It’s Ikat!
I was thinking about posting my nails with no polish today as a joke (yes, they really are that stained), but I decided against it. You guys already have to look at my incredibly dry cuticles/hands so it would be cruel to make you look at my icky yellow nails! So instead of looking at my bare nails today you get some ikat print inspired nails. Aren’t they adorable?
This manicure was actually something I had been wanting to do after watching an ikat nail tutorial on youtube, but I just hadn’t gotten around to it. I really love the darker look in the video, but whenever I think of ikat print I always think of a cute yellow ikat skirt I saw on Pinterest forever ago so I wanted to recreate the look with a light yellow. I started with four coats of Sinful Colors Unicorn. You only need three coats to get full opacity, but this polish is so damn streaky that I needed a nice (bordering on) thick coat to even it all out! After that I just followed the directions in the video and made a white dia

rakosha for his ninth league goal of the season.
Milan should have added a fourth late on but Theo Hernandez missed a sitter, having earlier been denied by Strakosha following an impressive run.
What does it mean? Lazio’s Scudetto hopes all but over
Lazio’s slim Scudetto hopes are surely all over as this loss leaves them seven points adrift of leaders Juventus with eight games to go.
As for Milan, they now have 10 points from a possible 12 since the restart – the exception being a disappointing 2-2 draw with SPAL last time out – and are in sixth place.
Zlat is back
Ibrahimovic now has two goals in two starts since recovering from an injury during the lockdown that many feared would bring a premature end to his career.
He may have got a bit of luck with the penalty – Strakosha really should have kept it out – but he made his presence felt and also teed up Calhanoglu’s opener.
Immobile absence is felt
Lazio were without Immobile for the first time in Serie A this season, while fellow forward Felipe Caicedo was also suspended.
Joaquin Correa and Luis Alberto had nowhere the same impact, managing just one shot on target between them.
Milan host league leaders Juventus on Tuesday, the same day that Lazio, who will hope Stefano Pioli’s men can do them a favour, travel to relegation-threatened Lecce.

Troubleshooting issues with your computer
If you’ve determined that the ERR_CERT_DATE_INVALID is caused by an issue on your computer, try these steps to resolve it:
- First things first, check the Date and Time set on your computer, if these are wrong it probably explains how you got the ERR_CERT_DATE_INVALID error.
- Sometimes fixing this error is as simple as shutting down your browser and then restarting it. Other times a system reboot may work. However, there are a couple of instances where you’ll need to do a little more work to set things straight.
- Check your connection, if you’re connected to public WiFi or some other public network there’s a chance that your browser is right and you don’t actually have a secure connection. If that’s the case, stop browsing and resume when you’re on a more secure setup.
- Scan your computer with a trusted antivirus software, you may have malware of some sort that is causing the issue. Unfortunately we can’t provide you with info on how to fix every last piece of malware, but if your antivirus can’t, someone on the internet probably knows.
- Disable any third-party plugins you have running on Chrome. Sometimes these can cause unwanted problems.
- Clear your browser cache on Chrome. Click the menu icon, open History and select “clear browsing data.”
- Delete and then re-install Chrome. Sometimes this helps.
- There are a few other crazy fixes like bringing down your firewall or modifying network settings. Don’t do that. If none of these fixes work, the issue could be site-side. But don’t sacrifice your security to connect to one website.
We hope this helped you fix the “Your Connection is not private” error

------------question-----------------------
What was the previous use of the property before it was purchased by the Clackamas SWCD
------------correct----------------------
Frequently asked (and answered!) questions (FAQ)
What was here before?About the propertyPreparing for constructionWhat is the CRC project?What are the impacts of the CRC project?Future
Q: What was the property used for before?
A: There is evidence that sometime prior to 35 years ago, the property was used as an apple orchard. When the previous owner purchased the property, he improved it for raising llamas.
Q: Was the pond always there?
A: The pond visible from Beavercreek Road and Ferguson Road was developed by the previous landowner. Interestingly, it is fed entirely by groundwater sources. The other pond was built by the previous landowner to capture runoff during the spring. He built a waterwheel to use the energy from the pond but that system remains unfinished.
Q: Why did the District choose this property?
A: The Clackamas SWCD chose to build on the already developed part of the property so that farm fields and open space would be retained. When the property was up for sale in 2013 it was marketed as a possible subdivision. The District’s purchase of the property prevented the loss of open space that would have occurred if a subdivision had gone in.
Q: How long have you owned the farm property?
A: The District purchased the property in 2013.
Q: How big is the property?
A: The Beavercreek Demonstration Farm covers 15.15 acres. This includes the footprint with buildings, the small woodlot, and the two ponds.
Q: Where is the small woodlot?
A: A small woodlot exists in the southwest corner of the property where a stand of Douglas fir trees provides habitat. The District has no plans to remove trees unless needed to maintain tree health.
Q: Why were buildings removed?
A: The Clackamas SWCD chose to build on the already developed part of the property so that farm fields and open space would be retained. To retain open space, the District had to remove old buildings that were not usable for a public agency.
Q: Couldn’t the buildings have been saved?
A: We offered the buildings to the local community, hoping that someone might want them. The cost of upgrading the structures to meet current building codes and to meet the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act was more than they are worth. The most prudent use of the public funds entrusted to the District is to remove those buildings. We are saving some of the most useful outbuildings. The District is committed to preserving the century-old barn. We have already invested tens of thousands of dollars to keep it standing. More work remains to be done!
Q: How can the District build an office on this site?
A: The site is zoned RA-2 which allows us to build through a conditional use provision specified in the Clackamas County zoning and development ordinances.
Q: What is the CRC project?
A: The Clackamas SWCD created a permanent conservation center to better serve our constituents in Clackamas County. We hope to also house the USDA Farm Service Agency and USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service so that the facility becomes a one-stop shop for our customers.
Q: How big is the building?
A: The new Conservation Resource Center is nearly 11,000 square feet in size. It includes space for the District’s employees and has a wing for use by partners. A 1,500-square-foot meeting room is included in the facility.
Q: Are there pictures available?
A: Yes! Hover over the Conservation Resource Center menu choice to see month-by-month photo sets.
Q: Is the District the only tenant in the building?
A: At this time, yes. We hope to be able to bring our federal partners into the space so that we can provide “one-stop shopping” to our customers.
Q: How long did the project take?
A: The District purchased the property in 2013. Active planning for the project began in 2017. Financing and permitting occurred in 2018. Construction started in February 2019 and was la

How did Lazio's recent loss impact their Scudetto hopes
------------correct----------------------
rakosha for his ninth league goal of the season.
Milan should have added a fourth late on but Theo Hernandez missed a sitter, having earlier been denied by Strakosha following an impressive run.
What does it mean? Lazio’s Scudetto hopes all but over
Lazio’s slim Scudetto hopes are surely all over as this loss leaves them seven points adrift of leaders Juventus with eight games to go.
As for Milan, they now have 10 points from a possible 12 since the restart – the exception being a disappointing 2-2 draw with SPAL last time out – and are in sixth place.
Zlat is back
Ibrahimovic now has two goals in two starts since recovering from an injury during the lockdown that many feared would bring a premature end to his career.
He may have got a bit of luck with the penalty – Strakosha really should have kept it out – but he made his presence felt and also teed up Calhanoglu’s opener.
Immobile absence is felt
Lazio were without Immobile for the first time in Serie A this season, while fellow forward Felipe Caicedo was also suspended.
Joaquin Correa and Luis Alberto had nowhere the same impact, managing just one shot on target between them.
Milan host league leaders Juventus on Tuesday, the same day that Lazio, who will hope Stefano Pioli’s men can do them a favour, travel to relegation-threatened Lecce.

What was the result of the match between the Chilli Boys and Orlando Pirates
------------correct----------------------
p about it. We have to go out and win it.”
After a troubled start to the campaign the Chilli Boys have finally found some purpose under Farouk Abrahams- losing just one game in his five matches in charge.
His latest exposé was against the defending Champions, Orlando Pirates, where they managed to keep the Buccaneers at bay to hold them to a 0-0 draw.
“We play a high tempo game and sometimes the guys are going to cramp in the second half, but that is the risk we take. We don't play around in our half- we play a percentage football which is exciting,” the coach said after Wednesday night’s game.
“We play off the front man which means there are more goalscoring chances coming our way.
“I thought Pirates was confused in the first half and they didn't press us in our half at all which forced them to play it long. We play to our strengths and so far it is working.”
The draw has left the coach confident they can get a result in Pretoria, especially after seeing their goalkeeper Daouda Kassaly pull off some heroics against the Sea Robbers.
“We have Tuks next on Saturday and, you know, we think we can go there with this type of performance and take three points.
“Hats off to our goalkeeper Kassaly because I made him captain after our game two weeks ago against Ajax, where he made a couple of blunders. I made him captain and what a captain performance it was- I am very proud of him,” concluded the coach

“Consistent with our quality standards for Nestlé Toll House refrigerated cookie dough, this change will only further enhance the safety of our products,” said Paul Bakus, general manager, Nestlé USA Baking Group.

On January 11 of this year, Nestlé informed the FDA that two samples of the cookie dough manufactured at the
According to a Nestlé spokesperson, flour is a likely suspect in the contamination since it is a raw agricultural commodity, and raw ingredients can carry risk. The switch to heat-treated flour was made to improve product safety and minimize this risk.The process of converting to heat-treated flour began on January 13, and production with the new ingredient began January 25. Product made with the heat-treated flour is expected to appear on grocery store shelves in early March. Nestlé will continue its new protocol of testing ingredients and finished product.
New York City takes the lead in lowering salt levels
Excessive salt can be a major contributor to hypertension, stroke, heart and kidney disease and other ailments. Starting in 1978, CSPI has been urging FDA to treat salt, or sodium chloride, as a food additive, as opposed to classifying it as an ingredient that is generally recognized as safe (GRAS).
CSPI filed lawsuits against FDA in 1982 and in 2005 to try to compel it to take action, and later in 2005 filed a regulatory petition that asked the agency to set maximum levels of salt in various food categories. The agency held a public hearing in 2007 but hasn’t taken any action since.
“Reducing sodium levels in packaged and restaurant foods could save thousands of lives a year in
Seventy percent of the population-a group that includes the elderly, African Americans and people with existing high blood pressure-should consume no more than 1,500 mg of sodium per day, according to the federal government. Others should limit their intake to less than 2,300 mg per day.
In 2009, CSPI analyzed the salt content in several popular chain restaurant meals, finding several with sodium levels between 5,000 to 7,000 mg. A high scorer, for example, was Red Lobster’s Admiral’s feast with creamy lobster-topped mashed potato, Caesar salad with dressing, a complimentary Cheddar Bay biscuit and lemonade-topping out at 7,106 mg of salt-enough to satisfy almost five day’s-worth for those on the lower, restricted levels of 1,500 mg per day.CSPI found Chili’s Buffalo Chicken fajitas and Honey-Chipotle ribs with mashed potatoes, gravy and seasonal vegetables provided 6,916 mg and 6,440 mg sodium respectively, while two Olive Garden meals came in at 6,176 mg and 5,735 mg of sodium.
When a cereal bag is something else
The brigades will function as collection sites for post-use Malt-O-Meal cereal bags and help prevent a significant amount of packaging waste from going into landfills. Individuals or school groups can sign up to sponsor a brigade, with proceeds to benefit a designated school, school-sponsored club, or school-sponsored special interest group. There is no cost to start a brigade, and all shipping costs are paid. For each Malt-O-Meal cereal bag collected and upcycled through TerraCycle, the designated school will be paid $.02 from TerraCycle.To learn more about TerraCycle or to sign up to sponsor a Malt-O-Meal cereal bag brigade, visit TerraCycle’s Web site.
Databases: The perfect complement to PLCs
“You might ask how it is they’re even related. For one thing, RDBs can be [like] an extension of PLC memory,” says Hechtman. Live values can be mirrored in RDBs bi-directionally. Historical values and events can be recorded there as well. But operators and managers can interact with them too. “Over the last six years I’ve delved heavily into SQL and learned a lot about relational databases. I’ve discovered that working with SQL is remarkably similar to working with PLCs and ladder logic,” adds Hechtman.
SQL has four basic commands and about a hundred different modifiers that can be applied to each in various ways to achieve all types of results. Hechtman provides an example: Imagine effluent from a wastewater plant with its flow, pH and other things being monitored and logged. That’s what you typically see. But now associate these with other things: discrete lab results, the name of the persons who did the lab work, the lab equipment IDs and calibration expiration dates, who was on shift at the time and the shift just prior, their certification levels, what chemicals where added and when, who the chemical suppliers were, how long the chemicals sat before use and so forth. All of this becomes relational data, meaning that if it’s arranged properly in tables, users can run SQL queries to obtain all types of interesting results. The queries might provide insight into the most likely conditions that could result in an improper discharge so it can be prevented in the future.
“SQL is a high level language that isn’t very hard to learn, and you can be very clever with it,” adds Hechtman. He prefers to think of it as a natural extension of his PLC programming skills. SQL can be used to obtain or extract the history of a machine for the period it has been operating, and that history can be stored in a relational database. Furthermore, RDBs and SQL pull people and processes together. Machines don’t run alone. They’re merely part of a containing process, and that process was devised by people. SQL and relational databases form the bridge to integrate processes, machinery and people.
Hechtman doesn’t believe a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS ) software package can fit an application any more than a COTS palletizer program can fit into different food processors’ applications. Every machine is different and every business process is different. That’s where SQL comes in. It has to duplicate or augment existing process flows, and these are intimately connected to the machinery.To get started, Hechtman suggests picking up a “Dummies” type book. Then download and install the open-source MySQL database server along with the MySQL administrator and query browser. It only takes a few minutes to install, and then engineers can begin to experiment. “You can read about a LEFT JOIN or INNER JOIN, but typing one in and observing the results is worth about 1,000 words,” says Hechtman.

[ All of what follows is from the article below. Mumford makes the case that:
“Had the recommendations of NSSM 200 been implemented in 1975, the world would be very different today. The prospects would have improved for every nation and people to be significantly more secure. There would be less civil and regional warfare, less starvation and hunger, a cleaner environment and less disease, greater educational opportunities, expanded civil rights, especially for women, and a political climate more conducive to the expansion of democracy.”
In other words, we wouldn’t be 6.5 billion over the carrying capacity of the planet, and 235 million over the carrying capacity of the United States (~100 million). There’d be more ground water, fossil fuels would have lasted decades longer, there’d be less top soil erosion and pollution, less of the (rain)forest would be clearcut — really — can you think of a single problem that wouldn’t benefit from fewer people?
But hey, Nixon wanted to get reelected, and made a deal with the Catholic Church that he’d back off on population measures in exchange for more Catholic voters. Republicans have extended that deal to right-wing fundamentalists to remain in power.
Alice Friedemann www.energyskeptic.com author of “When Trucks Stop Running: Energy and the Future of Transportation, 2015, Springer]
Mumford, S. D. February 5, 2012. Excerpts from: The Life and Death of NSSM 200: How the Destruction of Political Will Doomed a U.S. Population Policy. Church and State.
“Editor’s note: Given this November’s U.S. Presidential election and the Catholic Church’s immense stake in the outcome, we are publishing a series of articles by our chairman Dr. Stephen D. Mumford, founder and President of the North Carolina-based Center for Research on Population and Security. The following article draws from selected passages of Dr. Mumford’s seminal book, The Life and Death of NSSM 200: How the Destruction of Political Will Doomed a U.S. Population Policy (1996). It reveals the anti-democratic and anti-American machinations of the Vatican that killed the United States’ National Security Study Memorandum 200 (NSSM 200) report and succeeded in destroying American political will to deal with the overpopulation problem. This article is as relevant and revealing today as it was when it was first published by Focus in 1998.
The 1960s saw a surge in American public awareness of the world population problem. The invention of the contraceptive pill in 1960 stimulated broad public debate on birth control and the need for it.
When Pope John XXIII created the Papal Commission on Population and Birth Control in 1963, he gave the world hope that the Church was about to change its position on birth control. After all, why would the Vatican study the issue if the Church was not in a position to change its teaching on birth control?
In 1968, Paul Ehrlich published his book, The Population Bomb, the most successful book of its kind, ever. That same year, the journal Science published one of its most controversial articles ever, an essay by Garrett Hardin titled, “The Tragedy of the Commons,” which sparked much discussion of the overpopulation threat.
Among mainstream protestant denominations, the Presbyterians were one of the first to call for a forthright response to the problem. In 1965, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) urged “the government of the United States to be ready to assist countries who request help in the development of programs of voluntary planned parenthood as a practical and humane means of controlling fertility and population growth.”
In 1971, it recognized that reliance on private, voluntary decisions: “will not be sufficient to provide the necessary limitation of population growth unless there is a radical and rapid change in the attitudes and desires. The Church must commit itself to effecting this change. The assumption that couples have the freedom to have as many children as they can support should be challenged. We can no longer justify bringing into existence as many children as we desire. Our corporate responsibility to each other prohibits this. Given the population crisis we must recognize and teach, beginning with ourselves, that man has an obligation to limit the size of his family.”
And in 1972, the Presbyterians called on governments “to take such actions as will stabilize population size…. We who are motivated by the urgency of over-population rather than the prospect of decimation would preserve the species by responding in faith: Do not multiply—the earth is filled!”
This kind of increasing out cry for action made it safe—almost compelling—for American political leadership to identify with the concept of population growth control and to call for new programs to deal with the problem.
It was in this climate of rising concern that President Nixon sent to Congress his “Special Message on Problems of Population Growth.” Special messages to the Congress are exceedingly rare and this was the first such message on population. This action punctuated the beginning of the peak of American political will to deal with the mounting population crisis. The message, for the first time, committed the United States to confronting the population problem. Also rare, this special message was approved by the Congress. Its passage was bipartisan, indicating broad political support for American political action to combat this problem. The message was a water shed development, yet few recall it.
The most important element of the Special Message was its creation of the Commission on Population Growth and the American Future. During the signing of the bill establishing the Commission, President Nixon commented on the broad political and public support: “I believe this is an historic occasion. It has been made historic not simply by the act of the President in signing this measure, but by the fact that it has had bipartisan support and also such broad support in the Nation.”
The 24 member Commission was chaired by John D. Rockefeller 3rd. It ordered more than 100 research projects which collected and analyzed data that would make possible the formulation of a comprehensive U.S. population policy. After 2 years of intense effort, the Commission completed a 186-page report titled, Population and the American Future which offered more than 70 recommendations. The recommendations were a bold but sane response to the challenges we faced in 1973. For example, they called for: passage of a Population Education Act to help school systems establish well-planned population education programs; sex education to be widely available for all, including minors, at government expense if necessary; vastly expanded research in many areas related to population-growth control; and the elimination of all employment of illegal aliens.
The recommendations represented the conclusions of some of the nation’s most capable people. The scientists who completed the Commission’s 100 research projects were among the best in their fields. These recommendations are included in this book because it is important for the reader to know what the U.S. response to the population problem could have been and should have been. On May 5, 1972, at a ceremony held for the purpose of formally submitting the Commission’s findings and conclusions, President Nixon publicly renounced the report. This was 6 months before the President faced re-election and he was feeling intense political heat from one particularly powerful, foreign-controlled special interest group—the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church. Nothing happened toward implementation of any of the more than three score recommendations that collectively would have created a comprehensive U.S. population policy. Not one recommendation was ever adopted. To this day, the U.S. has no population policy, one of the few major countries with this distinction.

What are ants?
Ants invade properties throughout Boca Raton and Southeast Florida, and their small size allows them to quickly sneak into your building through tiny cracks and crevices. Ants are social creatures that live together in large colonies and are rarely seen traveling alone. Despite their range of colors and sizes, these insects are among the most identifiable with their three distinct body regions: head, thorax, and abdomen. They have antennae, chewing mouthparts, and six legs; only the reproductive members have wings.
Some of the most common species of ants living throughout our area of Southeast Florida include the following:
Big-headed ants are small and vary in color from red, brown, or yellow. The workers are classified as majors or minors. The minor workers' bodies and heads are proportionate in size, while the major workers' heart-shaped heads are much larger than the rest of their bodies.
These large ants are one of the most significant, home-invading species of wood-destroying insects in the United States. Carpenter ants are usually black, red, or a combination of those colors.
Crazy ants are most often identified by their behavior rather than by their appearance; workers move in an erratic, frenzied pattern – giving the impression that they are crazy and do not know where they are going. Crazy ants are dark brown to black in color and may also have a gray sheen.
These ants have a unique color pattern that makes them difficult to see. Their heads and thoraxes are dark brown and their abdomens are a pale yellow color, giving them a ghostly appearance.
"Sugar ant" is a term used to describe a variety of small ant species that commonly invade homes. These ants are typically black and are highly attracted to sweets and sugary liquids. Sugar ants' small size allows them to gain entrance to your property through any small opening.
Tropical fire ants
Tropical fire ants are a reddish-brown color and come in a variety of sizes, with the major workers having large, square heads. They are typically outdoor pests that create their nests in open, sunny areas.
These ants brown or black in color and are very small in size. As their name suggests, their feet are a distinctive pale color.
Are ants dangerous?
The good news is that most ants we come across are nuisance pests. Nuisance ants don't cause any significant harm, but their presence around your home should never be allowed. Ants contaminate food, introduce bacteria, and once established, can be very difficult to eradicate. Ants are potentially hazardous to people and property, depending on their species. Carpenter ants are dangerous because of the destruction they cause when invading and nesting inside structural wood. Tropical fire ants are a danger to people because they are an aggressive species and will defend their colony by delivering painful stings.
Why do I have an ant problem?
Ants are in your home or business because of the sources of food, water, and shelter they offer. They gain access to food and water from gardens, compost piles and trash cans, pet bowls, outdoor eating areas, and leaky outdoor fixtures; all

How did Zlatan Ibrahimovic contribute to Milan's victory against Lazio
------------correct----------------------
Zlatan Ibrahimovic was on target again as Milan beat Lazio 3-0 at Stadio Olimpico to derail their opponents’ Scudetto hopes.
Juve moved seven points clear at the summit with a 4-1 win over rivals Torino earlier on Saturday and Lazio were unable to close the gap in their game in hand.
Lazio had not lost in 16 home games since May 2019 but were two down at half-time – Ibrahimovic scoring a penalty after setting up Hakan Calhanoglu for the opener.
Ante Rebic added a third for Europe-chasing Milan in the second half as Lazio, without leading goalscorer Ciro Immobile, fell to just a second loss in 25 league matches.
Calhanoglu continued his good form since the restart by opening the scoring after 23 minutes, the midfielder’s strike deflecting off Marco Parolo to help it over Thomas Strakosha.
Ibrahimovic had a goal ruled out for offside but did not have to wait long to score from the penalty spot after Alexis Saelemaekers’ cross struck Stefan Radu’s hand.
Strakosha got a hand to the spot-kick 11 minutes before the break but it squirmed under his body to leave Lazio, who recovered from a goal down to beat Fiorentina in midweek, with a big mountain to climb.
Manuel Lazzari thought that he had started a second-half comeback when he drilled home, only for the offside flag to deny him, and further misery followed when Rebic added a third goal.
The Croatia international took Giacomo Bonaventura’s pass in his stride and swept past St

------------question-----------------------
What are some common outdoor locations where ants build nests
------------correct----------------------
things that are common in most yards. Ants build nests in a variety of indoor and outdoor locations, often nesting in soil located very near or next to homes. Once they are nesting on your property, it is only a matter of before they find their way inside while out foraging for food and, once inside, it is common for ants to build satellite nests near their newly discovered food sources.
Where will I find ants?
Ants nest in a variety of locations, depending on their species. Common outdoor nesting spots include the soil along fence lines, sidewalks, and driveways. They also build nests under mulch, rocks, woodpiles, and landscaping ties. Some ant species, like the tropical fire ant, have their nests in wide-open areas like residential yards, parks, and golf courses. Ants that have decided to nest inside usually do so in hard-to-reach places. Spaces above ceilings, behind large appliances and walls, under floors, and around hot water pipes are all common nesting spots. Carpenter ants create nests inside structural wood and are initially attracted to water-damaged wood.

Where will I find ants?
Ants nest in a variety of locations, depending on their species. Common outdoor nesting spots include the soil along fence lines, sidewalks, and driveways. They also build nests under mulch, rocks, woodpiles, and landscaping ties. Some ant species, like the tropical fire ant, have their nests in wide-open areas like residential yards, parks, and golf courses. Ants that have decided to nest inside usually do so in hard-to-reach places. Spaces above ceilings, behind large appliances and walls, under floors, and around hot water pipes are all common nesting spots. Carpenter ants create nests inside structural wood and are initially attracted to water-damaged wood.

What reasons does the author give for encouraging people to attend their local church
------------correct----------------------
tic one a car ride away.
It breaks my heart when Christians say they cannot come because our worship is too formal; our spirituality too ‘dead’; the place too much of a spiritual risk for their children. How will we change unless you come?
Going back to my school analogy, this was one of the hardest decisions we’ve ever made. But our local headteacher convinced us of her passion and her commitment and this month our daughter started at her school, within the estate. Yes, we will have to commit right back but this is no sacrifice. This is about exposing our daughter to the values that we hold dear, and I believe this can work for church too. As a minister I will commit to you, if you will commit to us.
It is likely to be hard work to go to your local church rather than one that ‘suits your needs’. If you are socially mobile, attending our church may feel sacrificial. If you are single, you are unlikely to meet the companion of your dreams here. If you are a parent, there is no weekly children’s or youth group. It may be you are not in a place to do this, you may genuinely be too vulnerable right now. But go and visit if you can.
I want you to go to your local church not just to ‘fix it’. Come and hang out in broken buildings with broken people. You’ll only get glimpses into glory but I have found those glimpses into people’s lives and God’s grace at work amongst the most meaningful in my life. You are likely to find the worst coffee you’ll have ever tasted and the warmest handshake you’ll ever receive.
Come join us; dare to love your local church

Why might prepared vegetables and fruits be marketed to people with disposable income and little time
------------correct----------------------
This is one of those posts that I can’t use my usual humour and sarcasm….. Although I will try!
There has been lots in the news of late about the dangers of ‘single use plastics’, straws and in turn packaged, prepared vegetables and fruits.
But what are often marketed to those with disposable income and little time are also an expense for someone for whom cutting up a whole cauliflower or pineapple could be problematic or energy consuming, when energy wasn’t a luxury, rather a commodity to be saved

things that are common in most yards. Ants build nests in a variety of indoor and outdoor locations, often nesting in soil located very near or next to homes. Once they are nesting on your property, it is only a matter of before they find their way inside while out foraging for food and, once inside, it is common for ants to build satellite nests near their newly discovered food sources.
Where will I find ants?
Ants nest in a variety of locations, depending on their species. Common outdoor nesting spots include the soil along fence lines, sidewalks, and driveways. They also build nests under mulch, rocks, woodpiles, and landscaping ties. Some ant species, like the tropical fire ant, have their nests in wide-open areas like residential yards, parks, and golf courses. Ants that have decided to nest inside usually do so in hard-to-reach places. Spaces above ceilings, behind large appliances and walls, under floors, and around hot water pipes are all common nesting spots. Carpenter ants create nests inside structural wood and are initially attracted to water-damaged wood.
