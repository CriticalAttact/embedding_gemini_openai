What services does Eavesway provide for cruise passengers traveling from Southampton
------------correct----------------------
nuary 1st 2015.
I know they already offer a cruise link service for P&O Cruises, Princess and Cunard, but offering the service for the other cruise lines that homeport ships in Southampton can’t come soon enough and I am very excited about it. It’s going to give cruisers so much more choice when it comes to deciding which ship to pick and more importantly, take away the hassle of things like rail and longer journey options to and from the port.
I have never had a bad experience with Eavesway or arrived at the port later than scheduled and best of all, I have never been ticked off for the fact my bags are usually over weight, OK! Always overweight! 😉 They have a 20kg weight limit per bag, however passengers can bring as much luggage as they like unless the cruise is over 21 nights in which case it is restricted to 3 cases per person.
I would recommend Eavesway to everyone. If you usually drive to Southampton and park your car at the port then for your next cruise just give Eavesway a try, I am positive you will never use the car again. You meet your coach, your luggage is loaded for you and that’s the last time you will see it until it magically appears outside your cabin. It’s so hassle free that even if you lose your ticket it doesn’t matter because they will have you on their list. It really couldn’t be any more convenient.

Sharp plans to help consumers record giant HD movie files to a Blu-ray disc.
The company is coming out with 13 new Aquos DX Series LCD TVs with built-in Blu-ray players/recorders.
Sharp introduced the DX Series in 2008, but the second edition extends HD video recording time up to seven times the usual length (7X mode). Even at 7X, the recording maintains “the exact same full-HD quality as the original high-definition broadcast,” according to Sharp.
The new TVs come with Sharp’s new Motion Guide, which enables users to browse TV, Internet and Blu-ray content while watching TV in the background.
The Image Select feature automatically adjusts images to the ideal setting based on room brightness and type of TV/video program or scene.
The DX Series TVs, available in sizes from 26 inches to 52 inches, will be demonstrated at CEATEC in Japan next week. They come in black, white and red.
There’s no word on pricing and U.S. release dates.

What role did Sidney Childs assume at SVSU, and what does he come with in terms of previous experience
------------correct----------------------
ter 17 years of service. Judy was admired by her colleagues, and respected by her students; she would go to great lengths to help our international students master the English language, which can be a challenging task. My best wishes to Judy in her retirement.
As some colleagues depart, others arrive. Sidney Childs began his duties as associate provost for Student Affairs this week. He will have a few weeks to work alongside Merry Jo Brandimore before she retires. Sidney comes to us from Bowling Green State University in Ohio, his alma mater, where he had served for the past 23 years, most recently as interim vice president for student affairs. Sidney has led programs to enhance student retention and persistence to graduation, and we will look to him to lead similar efforts here and maintain the excellent student service our students have come to expect. As opportunity permits, please introduce yourself and welcome him to SVSU.
We enjoyed a nice event this week as the restaurant Cardinal’s Nest opened for business, across the street from campus on Pierce Road. They hosted a fundraiser to support Alumni Legacy and Forever Red scholarships, and the event drew hundreds of faculty, staff, students and friends of SVSU. They may have even presented the recipe for one of their featured burgers, the Bachand. I look forward to trying it. My thanks to everyone who came to the event, and my best wishes to all our local businesses.
Finally, I received a request from our recently retired colleague Gene Hamilton to share something with you in this Weekly Update. He was quite touched by everyone who attended the dedication ceremony for Hamilton Gymnasium. In his words:
“I have been overwhelmed with the outpouring of sentiments and recognition for my retirement. To have the gymnasium bear the ‘Hamilton’ name is truly an honor, and to have a special plaque included to acknowledge the contributions and commitment of my late wife, Mary Pat, was highly unexpected. My family deeply appreciates the love and respect of the entire Cardinal family. I will not be far away, and I expect to make frequent visits to campus to volunteer and to see my many friends – including you – and I will always be a faithful Cardinal. With love and sincere gratitude" -- Gene Hamilton
May we all express similar sentiments when our days of service to SVSU are complete. Until such time, however, please keep up the good work and please enjoy your summer.

ter 17 years of service. Judy was admired by her colleagues, and respected by her students; she would go to great lengths to help our international students master the English language, which can be a challenging task. My best wishes to Judy in her retirement.
As some colleagues depart, others arrive. Sidney Childs began his duties as associate provost for Student Affairs this week. He will have a few weeks to work alongside Merry Jo Brandimore before she retires. Sidney comes to us from Bowling Green State University in Ohio, his alma mater, where he had served for the past 23 years, most recently as interim vice president for student affairs. Sidney has led programs to enhance student retention and persistence to graduation, and we will look to him to lead similar efforts here and maintain the excellent student service our students have come to expect. As opportunity permits, please introduce yourself and welcome him to SVSU.
We enjoyed a nice event this week as the restaurant Cardinal’s Nest opened for business, across the street from campus on Pierce Road. They hosted a fundraiser to support Alumni Legacy and Forever Red scholarships, and the event drew hundreds of faculty, staff, students and friends of SVSU. They may have even presented the recipe for one of their featured burgers, the Bachand. I look forward to trying it. My thanks to everyone who came to the event, and my best wishes to all our local businesses.

Hopefully you’re planning a summer vacation, but it might surprise you to learn that the U.S. is the only country in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) with no legally required vacation days or holidays. Many countries give their citizens much more time off than the U.S., and the European Union requires at least four weeks of paid vacation a year.
So Who Gets the Most Time Off?
Austrians seem to get the most generous offer with 22 paid vacation days and 13 separate individual holiday days. France also provides a substantial time off package, with 30 paid vacation days a year. Spain and Portugal offer 34 and 35 paid vacation days and holidays, respectively. Belgium and Germany offer 20 paid vacation days and 10 individual holiday days annually.
Historically, so many Europeans choose to take their time off in August, that many businesses in those cities simply close down the for the month. French and Italians like to travel to major cities and beaches all around Europe during their month off in August.
Americans Do Not Utilize Time Off
Although there is no obligation for time off in the United States, the private sector usually offers workers 10 vacation days and six individual holiday days. That’s bad enough, but to make matters worse, most Americans don’t even utilize the full amount of paid time off they receive. Research firm Harris Interactive asserts that Americans only use about 51 percent of their eligible vacation time.
Adam Sacks, president of the Tourism Economics division of Oxford Economics, argues that unused vacation ti

------------question-----------------------
What significant changes in higher education does the author suggest regarding tuition costs and learning methods
------------correct----------------------
e, tenure-track member of the faculty.
The number of employees in central system offices has increased six-fold since 1987, and the number of administrators in them by a factor of more than 34.
I have demonstrated in my book The Nearly Free University and The Emerging Economy: The Revolution in Higher Education that the tuition for a four-year bachelor's degree could (and should) cost $5,000, not $100,000 or $200,000.
The technology and tools already exist to accredit the student, not the institution and provide distributed courses, adaptive learning and real-world, workplace-based workshops for a tiny fraction of the ineffective, unaffordable system of higher education we are currently burdened with.
Once costs decline 95%, there is no need for student loans or the bloated bureaucracies currently overseeing the parasitic student-loan system.
Once we accredit the student, not the institution, existing universities will compete directly with Nearly Free Universities not in issuing diplomas but in how much students actually learned and mastered. If students can learn as much or more for $5,000 (including workshops in real-world workplaces) than they do for $160,000 in conventional universities, then the sectors of higher education that charge $160,000 for a 4-year degree will vanish.
In essence, technology has leapfrogged the existing higher education Status Quo, just as it has leapfrogged the banking sector.
Gordon T. Long and I discuss these issues in this 25-minute program:
Here is a taste of what we discuss:
THE LEGACY SYSTEM IS OBSOLETE
- Media and knowledge are no longer scarce—both are essentially free
- Students no longer need to be congregated in classrooms to hear oral lectures; the lectures can be distributed at almost no cost via the Internet
- The factory model of teaching the same texts and curriculum no longer makes sense; every digital device is a library and a display for oral lectures
- Lessons and methodologies of learning can now be tailored to individual students (adaptive learning) via interactive software
- The need for live oral lectures as the primary (and presumed to be best) mode of teaching has vanished
- Students learn mastery in workshops held in real-world workplaces, not classrooms
THE FUNDAMENTALS HAVE BROKEN
- Colleges must separate Research and Educational funding
- Education versus Occupational Training
- Internships versus Apprenticeships; why corporations are no longer training
- "Time is the New Competitive Dimension;" the educational systems needs to understand what this means
- The New Economy requires Soft Skills such as Collaboration, Lifetime Learning, Continual Innovation and the full spectrum of Entrepreneurial Skill

It is with great pleasure and pride that I share the news that we were selected to achieve the “Great College to Work For” recognition from the Chronicle of Higher Education. We are one of only 93 institutions chosen; the list includes community colleges, private universities and public universities. This award has been given for nine years, but this is the first time we have participated in the survey. We join the University of Michigan as the state’s only institutions to earn the distinction. We were honored in three categories: compensation and benefits; facilities, workspace and security; and teaching environment. While the recognition is nice, the most satisfying piece of this award is that it is based on your responses. This is reflective of what you think of our university. My thanks to everyone who worked on this and/or took the time to complete a survey, and my deepest appreciation to everyone who comes to work each day and makes this such a special place for our students and our colleagues.
We may not have to wait long for our next national award. I send my best wishes to recent graduate Kim Salwey and the members of our student-alumni group Forever Red as they travel to Atlanta next week for the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE) Network Convention. In March, Kim won the Outstanding Student Leader award and SVSU’s Forever Red won the Outstanding Student Organization award from CASE District V, which encompasses Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Ohio and Wisconsin. Each of the district winners are now eligible for the national award in their category. We are sending 13 SVSU representatives to the conference; it is a wonderful growth opportunity for them, and we hope they report good news from the awards ceremony Saturday, Aug. 6.
Congratulations to Matt Zivich, professor of art, whose 2015 painting, "Overboard," acrylic on canvas, was chosen as one of three top-awarded art works at the University of Michigan's juried 2016 Stamps School of Art & Design Annual Alumni Show. Approximately 170 works were submitted and 68 were selected for the exhibition, which opened this week and runs through Sunday, Aug. 7 at the Argus II gallery in Ann Arbor.
As mentioned above, this is a great place to work because so many people consistently demonstrate remarkable dedication to the students we serve. Judy Youngquist, senior ESL specialist, was one of these people. She recently retired af

Diary of Cathy Minges - Week 4 - December 20-26
Monday, December 20, 2010
Allen did his barn chores before he left for work. Another cold day with a lot of snow on the ground that is not going anywhere anytime soon! I worked at the FB office. Short week for me with the holidays. Allen will finish the week on Thursday. After work Allen worked on the livestock trailer. The back doors seem a little loose and he is tightening up the bolts. Not a very easy task as the bolts are behind a welded piece with no easy access to them. I went to Harrison after work to pick up a few last minute supplies. Allen put out round bales of hay and then went to get some straw they will need for the sale next week. Wyatt is having a semi trailer haul his cattle in, we may meet the trailer north of Eaton on I-70 to put our 4 head on for the trip to Zanesville. Scott will pull a gooseneck trailer with the big supplies they will need such as: chutes, generators, blowers, space heaters, straw and hay. Allen will pull our livestock trailer with other supplies they will need. We join together with Carrie and Wyatt on supplies since we all help each other. Allen did his evening feeding and checked bedding and water. Allen and Scott will start clipping later in the week for transport on next Tuesday. It takes a good 3-4 hours or more to clip on each head, plus the calf has to be washed and blown dry thoroughly before you can clip. Clipping takes a lot of practice and patience and can be very meticulous. Allen does a little prep clipping, but Scott does the majority. A good clip job will enhance the calf and is necessity with show cattle. Wyatt was going to start his sale clipping on Sunday with all the cattle he has in the sale. Not sure if he got started, he had people looking at steers on Sunday and sold a few head. Carrie helps Wyatt clip when she can. A few years ago for her birthday he gave he a hot pink toolbox and painted all her tools and clippers hot pink for her. That is one of her favorite colors. With all of Scott's work and Allen's work week, they will probably spend a majority of the weekend clipping, along with Monday to be ready to send the cattle on Tuesday.

More snow this morning, maybe another 2-3 inches. Allen up and fed cattle and did chores before he left for work at 6:00. I worked at the FB office. Our office is closed on Wednesday so this is the last day this week for me for the Christmas holiday! After work, Allen put out round bales for the cows, fed the calves and finished his other chores before we went Christmas shopping. He said he would finish up early so we could get a good start. Early to him was around 6:30. Grabbed a bit to eat on the way and did our one stop shopping at JC Penney. After 1 1/2 hrs we were finished and Allen hopes he doesn't see another store besides Tractor Supply for at least another year. Allen and Scott already talking about the next calf crop. Depending on how the bred heifer we have in the sale will sell, we may flush the cow for eggs. They plan ahead on how they will A/I breed a cow to what bull based on the genetics of the cow and bull. They are many things you look for and if a calf turns out really well, other advanced reproductive techniques such as flushing for more eggs to try to get the same quality calves for embryo transfers with recip cows. This can be a costly venture and we only consider this option with cows that are super-producers. Breeders will purchase their bull semen from catalogs with the genetics of the bull along with other EPD's (Expected Progeny Differences) such as: birth weight, weaning weight, yearly weight, milking ability, calving ease and other data used to make the calculations. You have to be careful breeding a heifer or small cow to bulls that produce large calves. This can cause real problems at birth in which you can loose the calf and possibly the cow or heifer.

Allen fed and did his other chores before leaving for work. This is his last full work day at his job before the holiday. He was at the Zoo again today and will return there on Jan. 3. His company is closed down for the week between Christmas and New Year. This will work out well for him with the upcoming cattle sale next week. I met Sheri to pick-up Cole for the day. I took Cole down to Ross for a haircut and we had to go to the bank. Afterwards we worked on painting ornaments that he is giving to family for the holidays. I did the usual Wednesday chores, cleaned, laundry and put our fresh Christmas greens for decorations in the house. Love the evergreen smell. After lunch we went over to visit my parents, something he loves to do and looks forward to each week. After Allen returned home from work a little later than usual, he did his feeding and other chores for the evening. Allen met Sheri to drop-off Cole and also load our semen tank in her vehicle for Scott. Sheri is finished with this semester of school so she is off work on Wednesdays a little earlier now. It weighs about 40 pounds and currently has about 100 straws of semen in the tank. The tank is filled with nitrogen gas to keep the semen froze for proper storage. A straw of semen can cost between $20 and $100, or much more, depending on the quality of the bulls. We insure the semen tank as a separate rider on our insurance policy, when it is full, you can have a lot of money at stake. I made pancakes and sausage for supper, hit the spot. Nice to be home for the evening. The cattle are all doing very well and tolerating the bitter cold weather, much better than we are.

Allen was able to sleep in a little today and got up at 6:00 to feed and do other barn chores. They have a short day at work today. He and other co-workers met down at the little restaurant in Okeana for their annual breakfast get-together before they go into work. They have a short company meeting then a catered meal before their holiday break. Allen returned home around 12:30 to head out to the barn. He put more round bales out and had to put out some more corn stalk bales for bedding. Keeping dry bedding for the cattle is always a priority. I was off today and star

What strategy does the author use as a form of discipline for their children
------------correct----------------------
Friday, January 11, 2013
I find great truth in the adage that the way we speak to our children becomes their inner voice, (while cringing with conviction at some of what I may have contributed in my yuckier moments of motherhood.) Recently, God has laid it on my heart to get serious about the messages that are being programmed into the hearts, minds and spirits of my offspring.
Practically speaking, it has resulted in sentence writing becoming my preferred form of discipline. It has helped my own reactionary nature because I can walk away from a situation, contemplate the real issue at hand and write sentences, tailored specifically to the issue(s), laced with Scripture, encouragement and admonition. The child then copies the sentences a predetermined number of times.
I love this strategy because it allows for the observance of another parenting pearl I adore: Rules without relationship always lead to rebellion. -Josh McDowell Our sentences generally start with a promise of God's love & their parents' love and wrap up with the same.
Because my strongest willed child seems to have inherited his Mama's mouth and hard headedness, we experience our fair share of run ins. Being somewhat secluded with none of our usual distractions and 'breaks' from one another

What benefits does the author find in using Eavesway Travel's cruise link service for reaching the port of Southampton
------------correct----------------------
One of the most important things for me when it comes to cruising is how I actually get to the port of Southampton. I live more or less at the other end of the country so the cruise link service is vital, without it the only cruising I would be doing is down the River Tyne in a dinghy, not quite the same really, is it?
I have used Eavesway Travel since 2010 and it’s now a firm part of my cruise experience. The coach journey from Washington Services (my pick-up point with Eavesway) to the port of Southampton takes roughly 7 hours. It sounds like a long time I know, but I can honestly say it never feels as long as it is. All the coaches are very comfortable and more importantly, very spacious. I couldn’t believe the amount of leg room between the seats when I first used the coach service. The driver will also usually take 2 comfort stops so this breaks the journey up nicely, gives you a chance to grab some food and stretch your legs. In all it’s a very relaxed start to your cruise and I know a lot of people who stopped taking their cars to the port because the cruise link service was so convenient and reliable.
Because I rely on Eavesway, as I am sure many others do, I wanted to use today’s blog to let you know about what’s happening with their cruise link service in 2014. From April, they will offer a cruise link service for P&O Cruises, Cunard, Princess, Royal Caribbean, Celebrity Cruises and it was recently announced that Fred Olsen will also be on the list.

Crime risks of three-dimensional virtual environments
Trends & issues in crime and criminal justice no. 388
Ian Warren and Darren Palmer
Canberra: Australian Institute of Criminology, February 2010
Foreword | Three-dimensional virtual environments (3dves) are the new generation of digital multi-user social networking platforms. Their immersive character allows users to create a digital humanised representation or avatar, enabling a degree of virtual interaction not possible through conventional text-based internet technologies. As recent international experience demonstrates, in addition to the conventional range of cybercrimes (including economic fraud, the dissemination of child pornography and copyright violations), the 'virtual-reality' promoted by 3dves is the source of great speculation and concern over a range of specific and emerging forms of crime and harm to users. This paper provides some examples of the types of harm currently emerging in 3dves and suggests internal regulation by user groups, terms of service, or end-user licensing agreements, possibly linked to real-world criminological principles. This paper also provides some directions for future research aimed at understanding the role of Australian criminal law and the justice system more broadly in this emerging field.
Debate over the potential harmful and criminological impacts of virtual worlds first emerged when North American journalist Julian Dibble (1993) documented the Mr Bungle case. It involved an alleged 'virtual rape' of a female user in the purely text-based virtual world called LambdaMOO. Any connection between a virtual and real crime in this case is highly debatable, because the harm involved 'a real-time non-consensual textual description of the rape' through 'the display…of graphic and offensive…sentences' (Lastowka & Hunter 2004: 295). Nevertheless, since the early 1990s, the rapid technological evolution and global appeal of many Web 2.0 social software platforms such as Facebook and MySpace (Coates, Suzor & Fitzgerald 2007), ensures new forms of user-generated internet content and 'virtual-reality' pose various risks worthy of ongoing criminological investigation (Williams 2006).
Smith, Grabosky and Urbas (2004) define cybercrime as the use of digital technologies to commit an offence, behaviour targeting communications technologies, or the use of these technologies for the commission of other crimes. Along with improved graphic capabilities, their global reach and their immersive or 'inter-real' character, the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) identify five additional characteristics of three-dimensional virtual environments (3dves) or virtual worlds:
- persistence, meaning that the virtual environment as it is seen by all users is the same and continues to host activity even when users log out (unlike video games, which shut down when the user logs off);
- central storage on a database controlled by the service provider;
- users interact in real time;
- a set of physical laws to determine how interactions take place 'in-world'; and
- participation by using an 'avatar' (de Zwart 2009).
These characteristics add to the degree of 'presence' associated with 3dve use (Boellstorff 2008). This feature is the main challenge 3dves pose to conventional understandings of cybercrime and cyber-harm.
Games and worlds
Most current generation 3dves are goal-directed multi-user games. World of Warcraft boasts over 11.5 million members worldwide (Blizzard 2008) within a platform containing various fictitious digital landscapes. Users pay an initial fee to purchase the gaming software, then additional monthly participation fees. Users must complete various goal-directed quests, such as slaying monsters or gathering special items, with the complexity of tasks and rewards for successful completion increasing the further one journeys through each stage. The platform also allows users to forge ongoing social ties, while receiving training for in-world roles and exchanging virtual currency to complete game-based objectives.
In contrast, Second Life is not a goal-directed game, although it supports many game-related activities. Abrahams (2007) describes Second Life as a virtual world promoting various business, educational, artistic and governmental activities.
With over 14 million users and 27,000 parcels of land, the distinctive feature of Second Life is a thriving market economy. Linden Lab, the platform administrator, actively encourages trade through the LindeX currency exchange. In April 2009, Linden$260 were the equivalent of US$1 and around Linden$5,851,223,689 were in circulation (Linden Lab 2009a).
Users are charged small fees to upload content into the platform. However, the bulk of trading activity involves land sales, the exchange of goods and services such as clothing, prefabricated buildings and counselling services, and the conversion of Lindens$ into real-world currency.
The initial cost of a parcel of land for private users is around $1,300, plus a further $900 each year for maintenance. Educational and charitable users are offered discounted land rates. In addition, a monthly premium membership fee of around $20 provides users with Linden$1,000. Land can only be purchased by paid members. This structure allows fee-payers to develop their own virtual environments according to their preference, imagination and technical ability.
3dves have been used to develop simulations of real-world behaviours useful in understanding crime prevention and citizenship issues (Hall et al. 2006). However, the free-market economic structure and real-world value of virtual currency blurs the boundaries between the virtual and the real.
For example, in 2007, it was estimated that up to US$75,000 was lost when the Ginko Bank in Second Life collapsed after offering investors 40 percent interest per annum on their Linden$ investments (Semuels 2008). This Ponzi scheme was able to flourish in the absence of any real-world regulatory scrutiny. It is therefore possible that 3dves can provide a lucrative global environment for financial scams devoid of any external regulatory oversight.
'Inter-reality' and immersion
The convergence of technical functions promotes two forms of inter-reality in 3dves. The first involves the creation of realistic 3D environments for users to navigate. The second relates to the functionality of the 'avatar', which is the medium through which users engage with the 3dve platform and other users.
Paid members or site developers create fantasy worlds or replicas of real-world environments by uploading jpeg images into the central data repository and manipulating these files to create a 3D landscape. Only fully-paid members who own an Island can construct an environment in this way.
An 'avatar' is a human-like representation of its user, which moves through the digital world by walking, flying, or 'teleporting' to new locations. The user controls avatar movements and can communicate with other avatars (users) in real time through speech, text or simulated gestures. Studies indicate that users place more trust in avatars with human characteristics and prefer to develop avatars that reflect their own gender and racial profiles (Nowak & Rauh 2005). However, with a few simple commands, users can easily alter their avatar's physical appearance, switch gender or adopt any number of fictitious or androgynous characteristics.
These immersive and synchronous elements of 3dves alter conventional notions of cyber-harm by converging text, audio and video communication methods. Therefore, offensive conduct can encompass interaction through speech, gestures, or simulated behaviours including sexual acts, assaults, gunshots and even terrorist attacks.
The reach of real-world law
The question of whether real-world notions of interpersonal harm apply to virtual assault or sexual assault is unresolved. This complicates the question of regulation within virtual worl

These People Under Any Circumstances.”
Josie was not interested in anything but fussing and pouring everyone’s drink on the floor. Nicholas kept disappearing to the bathroom, the bar, the kitchen – God knows where. I was sweating bullets from running up and down mopping up puddles of Josie’s mess and trying to track down my son.
The highlight. My friend Sandy’s youngest was trying to be helpful and tried to carry Josie across the restaurant. He is only a few inches taller than she. Yep. Dropped her right on her face on the concrete floor. You could hear her screams all the way to my hometown.
I rush outside with Baby J to calm her down. Not even five minutes later, Nan comes running out yelling at me to get back inside. Nicholas has it in his head that we have left him there. And he is letting everyone know it by sobbing hysterically in the middle of the wrestling ring.
I throw Baby J down and try to console Nicholas (to absolutely no avail). In the meantime Baby J has wandered off. Too the bar. (like mother, like daughter).
I’ll just take my wine to go – thank you. Got my sippy cup right here.
Nan’s oldest son was getting tired of the drama (as was the rest of the restaurant). He is practically pulling his mom out the door to escape the madness.
However, she sees me out of the corner of her eye, looking wild eyed trying to pawn my children off on Jeramy (the owner of the restaurant). In the meantime – Josie is trying to make drinks at the bar and Nicholas has sequestered himself in a corner (still crying) and refusing to leave.
Nan was not about to leave me alone – for fear she would wake up in the morning and read about me on the front page of the paper.
She is a good friend. Ranks right up there with Chardonnay.
So on this note – mama is taking a break. Headed to the mountains for family vacay. Where I am not allowed to plan the day’s activities.
Good bye my readers – wish us luck on the road and I’ll be back in a couple weeks

Submitted by Charles Hugh-Smith of OfTwoMinds blog,
Once we accredit the student, not the institution, existing universities will compete directly with Nearly Free Universities not in issuing diplomas but in how much students actually learned and mastered.
One of the key insights from recent work in psychology is that humans tend to substitute easier problems rather than solve difficult problems. Daniel Kahneman explained this dynamic in his recent book Thinking, Fast and Slow.
To "solve" a difficult problem we are unfamiliar with, we substitute a lesser problem we already know the answer to, and then declare we've "solved" the original (often knotty, complex) problem.
The real problem then festers, unsolved and addressed, while the misguided "solution" only drains resources and exacerbates the real problem.
An excellent example of this dynamic is higher education: the real problems are soaring costs and sharply declining yields in actual learning and in the real-world value of a diploma.
Consider the study Academically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses which concluded that "American higher education is characterized by limited or no learning for a large proportion of students."
These charts illustrate the costs and diminishing returns:
The yield (in earnings) on the increasingly unaffordable college degree is declining sharply:
The Status Quo has substituted two false "solutions" that completely ignore the real problems of soaring costs and diminishing returns: increasing student loans and hiring hundreds of thousands of non-teaching administrators.
While student loans have soared to over $1 trillion, with direct Federal loans ballooning from $115 billion to over $700 billion in a few short years, only 37% of freshmen at four-year colleges graduate in four years (58% finally graduate in six years), and 53% of recent college graduates under the age of 25 are unemployed or doing work they could have done without going to college.
New Analysis Shows Problematic Boom In Higher Ed Administrators:
In all, from 1987 until 2011-12--the most recent academic year for which comparable figures are available—universities and colleges collectively added 517,636 administrators and professional employees, according to the analysis by the New England Center for Investigative Reporting.
“There’s just a mind-boggling amount of money per student that’s being spent on administration,” said Andrew Gillen, a senior researcher at the institutes. “It raises a question of priorities.”
The ratio of nonacademic employees to faculty has also doubled. There are now two nonacademic employees at public and two and a half at private universities and colleges for every one full-tim

What is the significance of building social capital in Uganda's society as described in the speech
------------correct----------------------
Leaders focus on a resurgent Sri Lanka:
Building social capital on the foundation of national unity
The following are excerpts from this year’s D.
A. Rajapaksa memorial oration delivered on November 11 at the BMICH by
Professor Karunaratne Hangawatte of the Department of Criminal Justice,
University of Nevada, Las Vegas, US.
I am honoured humbled by the invitation to deliver this year’s Hon.
D.A. Rajapaksa oration on this solemn occasion commemorating the life
and legacy of the late Mr. Rajapaksa.
This year’s commemoration ceremony is very significant, because the
year 2009 marks an important milestone of the history of Sri Lanka.
Driven by the legacy of the Late D.A. Rajapaksa, his progeny have led
the way to finally free the nation from the grip of violent and vicious
terror that has plagued Sri Lanka for several decades.
It is no secret that the national and international community stands
in gratitude and salutes Your Excellency for your unwavering leadership,
our defense leaders and personnel for their enormous sacrifices, the
public servants, and the civic community that bore the burdens of untold
The concept of social capital
The late Hon. D.A. Rajapaksa has left an exemplary legacy of public
service and a set of values rooted in Sri lankan heritage.
Sri Lankan heritage is rooted in Buddhism, and is influenced by the
philosophical doctrines and practices of Hinduism, Christianity and
It is particularly characterised by the values of compassion, unity
and caring for others.
Over the last three decades LTTE terrorism has for the most part
retarded this legacy, destroyed the economy and economic development,
and severely damaged the social capital of Sri Lanka.
President Mahinda Rajapaksa has a sharp intellect that is
native to rural folks of Sri Lanka
Social capital in this context refers to social networks, community
and civic order that strengthen and integrate communities while helping
individuals achieve their goals. In this sense social networks have
value just the same way economic capital has value.
Social capital comprises the networks of association and cohesion
These include social, cultural and community networks, and community
relations that foster trust and a sense of belonging.
The norms, values and networks developed within and between different
ethnic and religious communities, and the personal relationships that
aid in achieving community goals can generally be conceptualized as
social capital. Social contacts that occur through social networking
have value because they affect both individual and collective
Social capital is not a single explanation or variable, it is how
informal human social relationships are important to the quality of life
of the entire community.
Just as economic capital and investment brings economic riches,
social capital building by improving social networks and cohesion
improves the quality of life for everyone throughout the country.
The next logical step is to eradicate any lingering terrorist
environments and violent ideologies from our culture and society.
In this respect it is very heartening to notice that, in the noblest
traditions of our heritage, President Mahinda Rajapaksa has no dedicated
the legacy and the spirit of public service that he has inherited from
his father, the late D.A. Rajapaksa to develop “social capital” through
unity. In my view, carrying the military defeat of terrorism to its
ultimate goal of establishing peace, unity and prosperity through social
capital building will be the best celebration of the life of late D.A.
Over the course of centuries Sri Lankan communities have been bound
in cohesion and enriched social capital.
Sri Lanka is a multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-cultural
society. Buddha preached (Atthahi Atthano Natho) the importance of
compassion towards others while having faith in self and the importance
of self examination of truths. The Bhagwad Gita is a set of teachings
about the performance of one’s duties, without attachment and without
any heed to the rewards that might follow. It is a sense of duty towards
our fellow beings, both human and non human. The Biblical concept of
covenant teaches love, loyalty, responsibility, and compassion among
those who join in covenantal relationships. It is a bond of belonging.
North African Scholar Ibn Khaldun referred to asabiyya, an Arabic term
for the spirit of kinship or social bonding in fourteenth century Islam.
Human relationships in Sri Lanka are heavily influenced by these
ethos and values that are built into our mixed heritage.
This is our heritage and it runs in our blood. Our heritage has
evolved over thousands of years. Colonial influences could not destroy
The Sri Lankan people have weathered foreign invasions, incursions
and encroachments, and various communities have lived together in
harmony for centuries bound by a common social experience.
LTTE terrorism and social capital
The strength of Sri Lankan social capital has gradually developed and
shined through thousands of years. But it has been weakened and damaged
by the LTTE in just three decades.
LTTE routinely perpetrated horrific violence against innocent
civilians of every communal and religious group of the country.
These violent crimes include large scale massacres, murder,
decapitation, drug smuggling, gun running, violent suppression of
dissent, bombing civil

What are the types of harms associated with the use of 3dves, and how should they be addressed according to the text
------------correct----------------------
mal behavioural norms or even the establishment of site-specific policing, security and vigilante services (Wall & Williams 2007).
Johnson and Post (1996) used net-federalism to describe the decentralised regulatory nature of the internet. Figure 1 indicates this model can be easily adapted to explain regulatory approaches in 3dves.
Under the net-federalism model, layers of site-specific governance are developed by user communities within the 3dve platform. These are overlaid by the platform's ToS and EULAs which, in turn, co-exist with four generic forms of regulatory control to promote good conduct and site security: formal law, market forces, informal norms and digital code (Lessig 1999).
Recent law enforcement literature indicates decentralised policing and security arrangements exist in all realms of contemporary social life. This tends to occur when conventional forms of centralised policing no longer meet the crime prevention needs of diverse communities (Shearing & Wood 2003), or where 'opportunistic' forms of third-party policing evolve to support specific interests of the state or concerned social groups (Mazerolle & Ransley 2006).
The sheer technical sophistication and variety of digital coding mechanisms and site-specific conduct norms to identify and prevent harmful activity also ensure considerable levels of 'responsibilisation' are actively promoted by the very structure of 3dve platforms (O'Malley & Palmer 1996). This means individual users or user-groups do not require extensive scrutiny or intervention by formal justice agencies or site administrators in response to the majority of 3dve harms. Provided they have the technical knowledge, user groups are arguably best situated to develop viable forms of digital coding or site-specific norms to prevent harm to digital infrastructure or other users (Wall & Williams 2007).
A typology of 3dve harm
In a decentralised and highly technical environment with high levels of user 'responsibilisation' for harm identification, prevention and the development of appropriate norms of good conduct, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding role of the criminal law in these multi-user platforms. This uncertainty is compounded by the wide range of regulatory choices available to users, confusion over the real-world implications of much of the behaviour within 3dves, the transnational appeal and jurisdictional uncertainties associated with these emerging media and the broader lack of empirical research documenting how 3dve users perceive issues relating to harm, risk, safety and governance.
The body of knowledge on each of these issues is so recent that it is premature to speculate on the ideal role of the criminal law in this field. Nevertheless, a basic typology of harms associated with 3dve use can help to clarify the various regulatory and harm-prevention strategies available to individuals, user communities and formal justice agencies.
Table 1 outlines a graded series of harms associated with 3dve use, ranging from behaviours with purely in-world implications considered too trivial to warrant formal action, to those with clearly actionable consequences under the criminal law. Within these extremes, a grey area of inter-real harms bridges the virtual and the real. Inter-real harms differ from conventional cybercrimes due to the peculiarly immersive character of 3dve technologies. How 3dve users view the severity of these harms is the most appropriate measure of the ideal regulatory approach in any given case.
Harms mediated by the technical or coding mechanisms facilitated by the platform should remain subject to current disciplinary and complaints processes established by platform administrators or under ToS agreements. For example, while activities such as digital cloning might generate fears that 3dves facilitate widespread and persistent identity thefts, systematic frauds, obscene behaviour or predatory real-world conduct (Wall 2008; Yar 2008), these nuisances are best prevented through rigorous internal digital coding modifications or informal policing, enforcement and dispute resolution methods (Wall & Williams 2007).
|Types of harm||Conduct||Proposed outcome|
|Purely in-world harm||Cloning, theft, appropriation or damage to digital property of limited value or which can be easily replaced, breach of gaming rules (cheating), innocuous harassment, obscenity (flying genitalia, bots)||Internal regulation by user groups (including eviction), ToS, EULAs or formal discipline, methods of coding to prevent harm developed by platform managers|
|Inter-real harm||Conduct affecting avatars or property with real world physical or economic consequences: includes virtual rape, assault, sexual harassment, fraud and deception, destruction of property, abusive or threatening speech||Real-world impact must be measurable and substantial to justify formal intervention beyond the ToS, EULA and site management complaint processes|
|Criminal harm||Conspiracies or threats to engage in crime against the person, property, the state, communication networks or children: includes stalking, privacy, piracy and copyright violations, money laundering, disabling or tampering with 3dve platforms||Conventional criminal laws subject to jurisdictional issues and the severity or prevalence of the conduct. Internet Service Providers or platform managers to provide evidence of real-world offending|
The rape of an avatar may produce some real-world physical discomfort or shock among unsuspecting or novice users (Boellstorff 2008: 189). This could be prevented through modifying simulation codes, in- or real-world counselling to deal with psychological or emotional harms or improved education about recognised risks for new 3dve users. Formal criminal intervention would only have a place if an appreciable and measurable effect on the real-world victim could be established, or if the violation clearly falls under the established criminal provisions targeting harmful online conduct (Criminal Code 1995 Part 10.6).
Similarly, most cases of financial deception or the purchase of faulty virtual goods in 3dves will involve a minor in-world financial penalty in the order of Linden$10. Market force and greater education for vulnerable users will play a more useful harm-prevention role than the enforcement of ToS agreements or any formal legal provisions.
In contrast, systematic and organised scams aimed at using 3dves as a means of making illicit profits or for laundering real- and virtual-world money clearly have coverage under existing criminal laws. Here, the major complexity lies in assessing the scale of harm to justify a formal criminal investigation. In such cases, Internet Service Providers and platform administrators would provide crucial support to investigators aiming to establish a successful prosecution satisfying the criminal burden of proof.
The various strands associated with harm, safety, immersion and regulation in 3dves greatly extend our conventional understanding of cybercrime. Three pertinent issues should underscore future research in this field.
The first involves enhancing our understanding of the nature of harm within multi-user 3dve platforms. Our preliminary typology and the work of ENISA (2008) provide useful starting points. ENISA's detailed report recommended the development of industry-wide standards to prevent intellectual property violations, spamming, poor user authentication procedures, automated attacks and in-world harassment, along with greater legal clarity of each of these issues.
Future research should also assess perceptions of harm, risk and appropriate educational and prevention strategies amongst 3dve users. This is crucial, given most calls for increased regulation of new technologies are made by those with little direct experience or understanding of how they are used or how they might cause harm (Wall 2008; Yar 2008).

------------question-----------------------
What lesson did the parent learn from their child's response about the importance of balance in coaching and parenting
------------correct----------------------
this week in Honduras brought a lot of our issues to the surface. (i.e., there were some sentences being written.)
It was a gift to my heart yesterday when he chose to copy (and add to) my closing remarks.
I am choosing to believe it was precious rather than that he simply wanted to have the last word. :)
Tonight as I was tucking in said child, I acknowledged that I knew this had been an intense week of 'coaching' from me. Attempting to tap into his love of sports and competitive nature I said, "You know how coaches treat champions, right? They keep working them because they know what they are capable of. That's how I feel about your heart & character. I know God has big plans for you, we just need to work on your self control muscles. What do you think about that?"
His very serious reply was, "I think sometimes, Mama, the coaches give their champs a break too--just to see what would happen."
If his tone hadn't been so pensive, I might have been offended. It was a humbling, big gulp moment for me, but one I plan to swallow with an even bigger dose of prayer.
Don’t exasperate your children by coming down hard on them. Take them by the hand and lead them in the way of the Master.
Ephesians 6:4 The Message
I knew so much more about parenting before I was one.

Dear Dr. Motola:

e been tried to help prevent this, however the results are not very successful. Utilizing a different energy source such as a laser may provide some advantage.** I am not sure if you have had a TURP or a radical prostatectomy. If it were a TURP, a more complete resection of the prostate can be helpful. If you had treatment with a radical prostatectomy, this becomes an extremely challenging problem because if the removal of the scarring is too aggressive, permanent incontinence can occur. Various prostatic stents are available that may also be helpful.**

How does Vick feel about becoming live-aboards compared to the author who feels comforted by it
------------correct----------------------
This is it. As of Monday we are officially live-aboards. To me that means that, starting on Monday, I will come home to the boat, sleep on the boat and wake up on the boat every day for the foreseeable future. This is deeply comforting to me. To Vick it means a week (only a week) of final push to sell everything that we own that doesn’t fit this new life, or doesn’t fit in the boat/manvan/storage unit. Monday is not deeply comforting to Vick.
This morning Vick made the brilliant and unexpected decision to call our good friend Katherine in for some professional organizing help. Katherine arrived late in the afternoon and the two of them lit into the piles of stuff that we’ve accumulated over the years and reduced it to a tidy stack of boxes and neatly organized piles. They made it through two rooms. Tomorrow Vick will be flying solo, but she’s already significantly more optimistic.
Ruby seems genuinely overjoyed with the prospect of moving onto a sailboat. I think she’s even given it significant and rational consideration. She knows that she’ll have next to no toys for example, but seems to think that

What are the main characteristics of three-dimensional virtual environments (3dves) that contribute to the complexities of cybercrime

Crime risks of three-dimensional virtual environments
Trends & issues in crime and criminal justice no. 388
Ian Warren and Darren Palmer
Canberra: Australian Institute of Criminology, February 2010
Foreword | Three-dimensional virtual environments (3dves) are the new generation of digital multi-user social networking platforms. Their immersive character allows users to create a digital humanised representation or avatar, enabling a degree of virtual interaction not possible through conventional text-based internet technologies. As recent international experience demonstrates, in addition to the conventional range of cybercrimes (including economic fraud, the dissemination of child pornography and copyright violations), the 'virtual-reality' promoted by 3dves is the source of great speculation and concern over a range of specific and emerging forms of crime and harm to users. This paper provides some examples of the types of harm currently emerging in 3dves and suggests internal regulation by user groups, terms of service, or end-user licensing agreements, possibly linked to real-world criminological principles. This paper also provides some directions for future research aimed at understanding the role of Australian criminal law and the justice system more broadly in this emerging field.
Debate over the potential harmful and criminological impacts of virtual worlds first emerged when North American journalist Julian Dibble (1993) documented the Mr Bungle case. It involved an alleged 'virtual rape' of a female user in the purely text-based virtual world called LambdaMOO. Any connection between a virtual and real crime in this case is highly debatable, because the harm involved 'a real-time non-consensual textual description of the rape' through 'the display…of graphic and offensive…sentences' (Lastowka & Hunter 2004: 295). Nevertheless, since the early 1990s, the rapid technological evolution and global appeal of many Web 2.0 social software platforms such as Facebook and MySpace (Coates, Suzor & Fitzgerald 2007), ensures new forms of user-generated internet content and 'virtual-reality' pose various risks worthy of ongoing criminological investigation (Williams 2006).
Smith, Grabosky and Urbas (2004) define cybercrime as the use of digital technologies to commit an offence, behaviour targeting communications technologies, or the use of these technologies for the commission of other crimes. Along with improved graphic capabilities, their global reach and their immersive or 'inter-real' character, the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) identify five additional characteristics of three-dimensional virtual environments (3dves) or virtual worlds:
- persistence, meaning that the virtual environment as it is seen by all users is the same and continues to host activity even when users log out (unlike video games, which shut down when the user logs off);
- central storage on a database controlled by the service provider;
- users interact in real time;
- a set of physical laws to determine how interactions take place 'in-world'; and
- participation by using an 'avatar' (de Zwart 2009).
These characteristics add to the degree of 'presence' associated with 3dve use (Boellstorff 2008). This feature is the main challenge 3dves pose to conventional understandings of cybercrime and cyber-harm.
Games and worlds
Most current generation 3dves are goal-directed multi-user games. World of Warcraft boasts over 11.5 million members worldwide (Blizzard 2008) within a platform containing various fictitious digital landscapes. Users pay an initial fee to purchase the gaming software, then additional monthly participation fees. Users must complete various goal-directed quests, such as slaying monsters or gathering special items, with the complexity of tasks and rewards for successful completion increasing the further one journeys through each stage. The platform also allows users to forge ongoing social ties, while receiving training for in-world roles and exchanging virtual currency to complete game-based objectives.
In contrast, Second Life is not a goal-directed game, although it supports many game-related activities. Abrahams (2007) describes Second Life as a virtual world promoting various business, educational, artistic and governmental activities.
With over 14 million users and 27,000 parcels of land, the distinctive feature of Second Life is a thriving market economy. Linden Lab, the platform administrator, actively encourages trade through the LindeX currency exchange. In April 2009, Linden$260 were the equivalent of US$1 and around Linden$5,851,223,689 were in circulation (Linden Lab 2009a).
Users are charged small fees to upload content into the platform. However, the bulk of trading activity involves land sales, the exchange of goods and services such as clothing, prefabricated buildings and counselling services, and the conversion of Lindens$ into real-world currency.
The initial cost of a parcel of land for private users is around $1,300, plus a further $900 each year for maintenance. Educational and charitable users are offered discounted land rates. In addition, a monthly premium membership fee of around $20 provides users with Linden$1,000. Land can only be purchased by paid members. This structure allows fee-payers to develop their own virtual environments according to their preference, imagination and technical ability.
3dves have been used to develop simulations of real-world behaviours useful in understanding crime prevention and citizenship issues (Hall et al. 2006). However, the free-market economic structure and real-world value of virtual currency blurs the boundaries between the virtual and the real.
For example, in 2007, it was estimated that up to US$75,000 was lost when the Ginko Bank in Second Life collapsed after offering investors 40 percent interest per annum on their Linden$ investments (Semuels 2008). This Ponzi scheme was able to flourish in the absence of any real-world regulatory scrutiny. It is therefore possible that 3dves can provide a lucrative global environment for financial scams devoid of any external regulatory oversight.
'Inter-reality' and immersion
The convergence of technical functions promotes two forms of inter-reality in 3dves. The first involves the creation of realistic 3D environments for users to navigate. The second relates to the functionality of the 'avatar', which is the medium through which users engage with the 3dve platform and other users.
Paid members or site developers create fantasy worlds or replicas of real-world environments by uploading jpeg images into the central data repository and manipulating these files to create a 3D landscape. Only fully-paid members who own an Island can construct an environment in this way.
An 'avatar' is a human-like representation of its user, which moves through the digital world by walking, flying, or 'teleporting' to new locations. The user controls avatar movements and can communicate with other avatars (users) in real time through speech, text or simulated gestures. Studies indicate that users place more trust in avatars with human characteristics and prefer to develop avatars that reflect their own gender and racial profiles (Nowak & Rauh 2005). However, with a few simple commands, users can easily alter their avatar's physical appearance, switch gender or adopt any number of fictitious or androgynous characteristics.
These immersive and synchronous elements of 3dves alter conventional notions of cyber-harm by converging text, audio and video communication methods. Therefore, offensive conduct can encompass interaction through speech, gestures, or simulated behaviours including sexual acts, assaults, gunshots and even terrorist attacks.
The reach of real-world law
The question of whether real-world notions of interpersonal harm apply to virtual assault or sexual assault is unresolved. This complicates the question of regulation within virtual worl

What caused chaos in the restaurant during the author's visit
------------correct----------------------
These People Under Any Circumstances.”
Josie was not interested in anything but fussing and pouring everyone’s drink on the floor. Nicholas kept disappearing to the bathroom, the bar, the kitchen – God knows where. I was sweating bullets from running up and down mopping up puddles of Josie’s mess and trying to track down my son.
The highlight. My friend Sandy’s youngest was trying to be helpful and tried to carry Josie across the restaurant. He is only a few inches taller than she. Yep. Dropped her right on her face on the concrete floor. You could hear her screams all the way to my hometown.
I rush outside with Baby J to calm her down. Not even five minutes later, Nan comes running out yelling at me to get back inside. Nicholas has it in his head that we have left him there. And he is letting everyone know it by sobbing hysterically in the middle of the wrestling ring.
I throw Baby J down and try to console Nicholas (to absolutely no avail). In the meantime Baby J has wandered off. Too the bar. (like mother, like daughter).
I’ll just take my wine to go – thank you. Got my sippy cup right here.
Nan’s oldest son was getting tired of the drama (as was the rest of the restaurant). He is practically pulling his mom out the door to escape the madness.
However, she sees me out of the corner of her eye, looking wild eyed trying to pawn my children off on Jeramy (the owner of the restaurant). In the meantime – Josie is trying to make drinks at the bar and Nicholas has sequestered himself in a corner (still crying) and refusing to leave.
Nan was not about to leave me alone – for fear she would wake up in the morning and read about me on the front page of the paper.
She is a good friend. Ranks right up there with Chardonnay.
So on this note – mama is taking a break. Headed to the mountains for family vacay. Where I am not allowed to plan the day’s activities.
Good bye my readers – wish us luck on the road and I’ll be back in a couple weeks

What is the new feature of the Aquos DX Series LCD TVs that allows for extended recording times while maintaining full HD quality
------------correct----------------------
October 02, 2009 by Julie Jacobson
Sharp plans to help consumers record giant HD movie files to a Blu-ray disc.
The company is coming out with 13 new Aquos DX Series LCD TVs with built-in Blu-ray players/recorders.
Sharp introduced the DX Series in 2008, but the second edition extends HD video recording time up to seven times the usual length (7X mode). Even at 7X, the recording maintains “the exact same full-HD quality as the original high-definition broadcast,” according to Sharp.
The new TVs come with Sharp’s new Motion Guide, which enables users to browse TV, Internet and Blu-ray content while watching TV in the background.
The Image Select feature automatically adjusts images to the ideal setting based on room brightness and type of TV/video program or scene.
The DX Series TVs, available in sizes from 26 inches to 52 inches, will be demonstrated at CEATEC in Japan next week. They come in black, white and red.
There’s no word on pricing and U.S. release dates.

The new TVs come with Sharp’s new Motion Guide, which enables users to browse TV, Internet and Blu-ray content while watching TV in the background.
The Image Select feature automatically adjusts images to the ideal setting based on room brightness and type of TV/video program or scene.
The DX Series TVs, available in sizes from 26 inches to 52 inches, will be demonstrated at CEATEC in Japan next week. They come in black, white and red.
There’s no word on pricing and U.S. release dates.

South America's powerhouse faces tough dilemmas in 2014.
Brazil is hastily preparing to host two of the world's premier mega-events: the World Cup starting in June and the Olympics just 24 months later. While it has come under heavy criticism for the slow pace of preparations, among other things, this is a country that knows how to throw a party.
Meanwhile, the government is gearing up for a repeat of last year's social protests. In 2013, more than 1 million people flooded the streets to denounce poor-quality services, the skyrocketing cost of living and the deterioration in public safety. Brazil faces profound problems with violence, including more homicides than any other nation and an exploding prison population.
The way a society cares for its prison population is a good index of its values and civility. A cursory inspection of Brazil's penal justice system reveals a culture bordering on sadism. The country features the world's fourth-largest prison population, with roughly 550,000 inmates occupying cell space designed for less than 300,000. Almost half of them have yet to be tried and languish for years before seeing a judge. A study by the International Bar Association's Human Rights Institute found that 1 in 5 pretrial prisoners was jailed improperly. Almost a third of all inmate deaths are a result of homicide, six times the rate for the country as a whole.
Brazil's prisons have been among the world's most violent for decades. A 1992 prison riot in Sao Paulo's infamous Carandiru prison left 111 members of rival gangs dead. It took more than two decades for riot police accused of the killings to finally be brought to justice. The First Command of the Capital, or PCC, the nation's most powerful gang, was formed to avenge the victims of that riot.
Violence in Brazilian prisons amplifies violence on Brazilian streets. In 2006, the PCC launched a wave of attacks against law enforcement and penal personnel as a protest over prison conditions. At least 450 people were killed and riots were organised in more than 70 prisons.
Many of Brazil's poorly managed prisons are lorded over by gangs that serve as de facto judges, jurors and executioners. A recent government report describes crumbling facilities where torture, sexual violence and beheading are rampant. In the notorious Pedrinhas penitentiary in Maranhao state, for example, some 60 inmates were brutally slain in 2013. More than 60 deaths were reported in the Pernambuco state prison system a few years earlier. Gangs also recruit most of their rank and file from prisons and organise their business from within their walls. Even Justice Minister Jose Eduardo Cardozo recently said he'd rather die than be condemned to a Brazilian prison.
Brazil's penitentiaries are filling up faster than they can be built. Controversial privatisation efforts are far from keeping pace with the ever-increasing nu

One of the most important things for me when it comes to cruising is how I actually get to the port of Southampton. I live more or less at the other end of the country so the cruise link service is vital, without it the only cruising I would be doing is down the River Tyne in a dinghy, not quite the same really, is it?
I have used Eavesway Travel since 2010 and it’s now a firm part of my cruise experience. The coach journey from Washington Services (my pick-up point with Eavesway) to the port of Southampton takes roughly 7 hours. It sounds like a long time I know, but I can honestly say it never feels as long as it is. All the coaches are very comfortable and more importantly, very spacious. I couldn’t believe the amount of leg room between the seats when I first used the coach service. The driver will also usually take 2 comfort stops so this breaks the journey up nicely, gives you a chance to grab some food and stretch your legs. In all it’s a very relaxed start to your cruise and I know a lot of people who stopped taking their cars to the port because the cruise link service was so convenient and reliable.
Because I rely on Eavesway, as I am sure many others do, I wanted to use today’s blog to let you know about what’s happening with their cruise link service in 2014. From April, they will offer a cruise link service for P&O Cruises, Cunard, Princess, Royal Caribbean, Celebrity Cruises and it was recently announced that Fred Olsen will also be on the list. Eavesway will also be freezing their 2013 prices until Ja

------------question-----------------------
What type of molasses was used in the recipe, and why was honey added
------------correct----------------------
the chicken separately with the oven on convect. The chicken turned out beautifully and the potatoes turned orange because of the molasses. But it all worked out. It was delicious. Or at least no one complained.
The recipe is here and basically it’s very easy. I used all chicken thighs, Yotam likes the leg and thigh, and since pomegranate molasses is very sour I added a couple of TBs of my sister’s honey.

What is the estimated number of children diagnosed with cerebral palsy each year and what are some common risk factors
------------correct----------------------
bout 1 in 400 births (which means about 1,800 children, from all social backgrounds and ethnic groups, are diagnosed every year, and about 250 per year in the region in which Pace is based). Common risk factors include premature and multiple births. Cerebral palsy is often not diagnosed until developmental milestones are observed to be delayed (typically 3-18 months).

What were the primary effects of the LTTE's actions on social capital in Sri Lanka
------------correct----------------------
ian targets, child recruitment and kidnapping, and
The LTTE randomly targeted women and children, rural communities,
places of worship, and mass transportation including trains, buses and
bus stations. Babies were separated from breast feeding mothers and
hacked to death.
Their violence was random and unprovoked.
Their purpose was to cause havoc through random fear. This was their
morality. But at what cost! Do any events that happened in the past
justify this horrific violence against innocent Sri Lankans?
The worst consequence of LTTE terrorist campaign has been the
destruction of our long-developed social capital.
For example, personal relations between friends, neighbours and
families have been affected due to growing mistrust and suspicion among
ethnic groups, police and community relations have suffered due to
detachment of police from the community, political leaders have become
isolated from the public, people have lost access to their
representatives and public servants, barriers have prevented free
movement and socialization, multi community integration through
participation at religious ceremonies such as Vesak and Madu
celebrations and visits to multi religious places of worship such as
Kataragama, Sri Pada and Anuradhapura have been adversely affected, and
people have kept away from large community gatherings due to fear of
Loss of contact among people and between communities have affected
individual and collective productivity due to loss of employment, trade
Social functions such as Shrama Dana, through which people help each
other with various projects by donating labour, have ceased. Many
social, cultural and public institutions have crumbled under the weight
As a result of LTTE terror, communities that have the capacity to
peacefully co-exist have become sharply divided and grown suspicious of
each other. Violence has become a common norm in some urban areas. There
is a decline of civic engagement and our social and cultural
institutions have begun to crumble. Consequently it has created a
political culture that is authoritative and repressive. This
transformation seems to have occurred during the last three decades at
an accelerated pace. What should a democratically elected Government do
under these circumstances?
Successive governments in the last three decades have attempted to
tackle the LTTE problem.
They have attempted military and non-military options including peace
negotiations and the introduction of new constitutional and legal
frameworks. None of these were successful for various reasons. Peace
negotiations were unsuccessful mainly due to lack of forthright dealing
by the LTTE.
Finally the present Government led by President Mahinda Rajapaksa has
managed to wipe out LTTE terror from Sri Lanka by acting with laster
like focus and sheer determination on the task at hand.
The feat of the LTTE and the eradication of terrorism from our soil
are significant historical events because the major cause of the
dissipation and destruction of social capital has been removed.
We have reached an important milestone in our history. Presently we
are passing through a time when the hard fought victories against
vicious terror must be solidified to ensure that terrorism will never
again raise its ugly head in Sri Lanka.
We have suffered enough. It is crucial that every peace loving Sri
Lankan bond together with the Government in its effort to guarantee
everlasting peaceful co-existence under one banner of unity.
Otherwise all of the valuable lives, limbs and property lost and the
sorrow of families disjointed and scattered in the last three decades,
and the valiant efforts of those who fought will be in vain. May not the
lives and tearers of innocent mothers, fathers and children go to waste.
It will be the worst crime against humanity ever in the history of
Obviously rebuilding social capital by improving trust among and
within communities and by improving the sense of personal security takes
more hard work than building economic capital.
Nevertheless building social capital will enhance personal and
collective productivity, bring lasting peace and prosperity, and improve
the quality of life of every Sri Lankan citizen.
Crushing the LTTE terrorism militarily was a daunting task that
required enormous sacrifices and hard work.
Now, the same leadership can take us to a resurgent Sri Lanka through
building social capital on a foundation of national unity. Social
capital can be revitalised through economic development and through
social and legal frameworks. First I will discuss economic development.
Now that the military war is over it is time to rearrange budgetary
priorities and spend the war capital wisely.
In this respect it is laudable to note that the Government in
cooperation with the private sector has already embarked on various
development projects aimed at erecting infrastructures, building homes,
schools and places of worship in the areas of the North and East that
have been seriously affected by war.
In addition, various development schemes are under way to bring
economic well being to rural areas specially in the dry zone and at the
periphery that have been neglected for a long period of time.
Successive Governments of Sri Lanka have neglected development at the
periphery. Industrialization has focused around urban centres.

ter 17 years of service. Judy was admired by her colleagues, and respected by her students; she would go to great lengths to help our international students master the English language, which can be a challenging task. My best wishes to Judy in her retirement.
As some colleagues depart, others arrive. Sidney Childs began his duties as associate provost for Student Affairs this week. He will have a few weeks to work alongside Merry Jo Brandimore before she retires. Sidney comes to us from Bowling Green State University in Ohio, his alma mater, where he had served for the past 23 years, most recently as interim vice president for student affairs. Sidney has led programs to enhance student retention and persistence to graduation, and we will look to him to lead similar efforts here and maintain the excellent student service our students have come to expect. As opportunity permits, please introduce yourself and welcome him to SVSU.
We enjoyed a nice event this week as the restaurant Cardinal’s Nest opened for business, across the street from campus on Pierce Road. They hosted a fundraiser to support Alumni Legacy and Forever Red scholarships, and the event drew hundreds of faculty, staff, students and friends of SVSU. They may have even presented the recipe for one of their featured burgers, the Bachand. I look forward to trying it. My thanks to everyone who came to the event, and my best wishes to all our local businesses.
Finally, I received a request from our recently retired colleague Gene Hamilton to share something with you in this Weekly Update. He was quite touched by everyone who attended the dedication ceremony for Hamilton Gymnasium. In his words:
“I have been overwhelmed with the outpouring of sentiments and recognition for my retirement. To have the gymnasium bear the ‘Hamilton’ name is truly an honor, and to have a special plaque included to acknowledge the contributions and commitment of my late wife, Mary Pat, was highly unexpected. My family deeply appreciates the love and respect of the entire Cardinal family. I will not be far away, and I expect to make frequent visits to campus to volunteer and to see my many friends – including you – and I will always be a faithful Cardinal. With love and sincere gratitude" -- Gene Hamilton
May we all express similar sentiments when our days of service to SVSU are complete. Until such time, however, please keep up the good work and please enjoy your summer.

What significant events is Brazil preparing to hold in 2014, and how has it been criticized in relation to these preparations
------------correct----------------------
South America's powerhouse faces tough dilemmas in 2014.
Brazil is hastily preparing to host two of the world's premier mega-events: the World Cup starting in June and the Olympics just 24 months later. While it has come under heavy criticism for the slow pace of preparations, among other things, this is a country that knows how to throw a party.
Meanwhile, the government is gearing up for a repeat of last year's social protests. In 2013, more than 1 million people flooded the streets to denounce poor-quality services, the skyrocketing cost of living and the deterioration in public safety. Brazil faces profound problems with violence, including more homicides than any other nation and an exploding prison population.
The way a society cares for its prison population is a good index of its values and civility. A cursory inspection of Brazil's penal justice system reveals a culture bordering on sadism. The country features the world's fourth-largest prison population, with roughly 550,000 inmates occupying cell space designed for less than 300,000. Almost half of them have yet to be tried and languish for years before seeing a judge. A study by the International Bar Association's Human Rights Institute found that 1 in 5 pretrial prisoners was jailed improperly. Almost a third of all inmate deaths are a result of homicide, six times the rate for the country as a whole.
Brazil's prisons have been among the world's most violent for decades. A 1992 prison riot in Sao Paulo's infamous Carandiru prison left 111 members of rival gangs dead. It took more than two decades for riot police accused of the killings to finally be brought to justice. The First Command of the Capital, or PCC, the nation's most powerful gang, was formed to avenge the victims of that riot.
Violence in Brazilian prisons amplifies violence on Brazilian streets. In 2006, the PCC launched a wave of attacks against law enforcement and penal personnel as a protest over prison conditions. At least 450 people were killed and riots were organised in more than 70 prisons.
Many of Brazil's poorly managed prisons are lorded over by gangs that serve as de facto judges, jurors and executioners. A recent government report describes crumbling facilities where torture, sexual violence and beheading are rampant. In the notorious Pedrinhas penitentiary in Maranhao state, for example, some 60 inmates were brutally slain in 2013. More than 60 deaths were reported in the Pernambuco state prison system a few years earlier. Gangs also recruit most of their rank and file from prisons and organise their business from within their walls. Even Justice Minister Jose Eduardo Cardozo recently said he'd rather die than be condemned to a Brazilian prison.
Brazil's penitentiaries are filling up faster than they can be built. Controversial privatisation efforts are far from keeping pace with the ever-increasing nu

A recent government report describes crumbling facilities where torture, sexual violence and beheading are rampant. In the notorious Pedrinhas penitentiary in Maranhao state, for example, some 60 inmates were brutally slain in 2013. More than 60 deaths were reported in the Pernambuco state prison system a few years earlier. Gangs also recruit most of their rank and file from prisons and organise their business from within their walls. Even Justice Minister Jose Eduardo Cardozo recently said he'd rather die than be condemned to a Brazilian prison.
Brazil's penitentiaries are filling up faster than they can be built. Controversial privatisation efforts are far from keeping pace with the ever-increasing nu

Which country in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has no legally required vacation days or holidays
------------correct----------------------
Hopefully you’re planning a summer vacation, but it might surprise you to learn that the U.S. is the only country in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) with no legally required vacation days or holidays. Many countries give their citizens much more time off than the U.S., and the European Union requires at least four weeks of paid vacation a year.
So Who Gets the Most Time Off?
Austrians seem to get the most generous offer with 22 paid vacation days and 13 separate individual holiday days. France also provides a substantial time off package, with 30 paid vacation days a year. Spain and Portugal offer 34 and 35 paid vacation days and holidays, respectively. Belgium and Germany offer 20 paid vacation days and 10 individual holiday days annually.
Historically, so many Europeans choose to take their time off in August, that many businesses in those cities simply close down the for the month. French and Italians like to travel to major cities and beaches all around Europe during their month off in August.
Americans Do Not Utilize Time Off
Although there is no obligation for time off in the United States, the private sector usually offers workers 10 vacation days and six individual holiday days. That’s bad enough, but to make matters worse, most Americans don’t even utilize the full amount of paid time off they receive. Research firm Harris Interactive asserts that Americans only use about 51 percent of their eligible vacation time.

I find great truth in the adage that the way we speak to our children becomes their inner voice, (while cringing with conviction at some of what I may have contributed in my yuckier moments of motherhood.) Recently, God has laid it on my heart to get serious about the messages that are being programmed into the hearts, minds and spirits of my offspring.
Practically speaking, it has resulted in sentence writing becoming my preferred form of discipline. It has helped my own reactionary nature because I can walk away from a situation, contemplate the real issue at hand and write sentences, tailored specifically to the issue(s), laced with Scripture, encouragement and admonition. The child then copies the sentences a predetermined number of times.
I love this strategy because it allows for the observance of another parenting pearl I adore: Rules without relationship always lead to rebellion. -Josh McDowell Our sentences generally start with a promise of God's love & their parents' love and wrap up with the same.
Because my strongest willed child seems to have inherited his Mama's mouth and hard headedness, we experience our fair share of run ins. Being somewhat secluded with none of our usual distractions and 'breaks' from one another

What activities did Allen engage in to prepare for the sale cattle and family events during the Christmas holiday
------------correct----------------------
ted cleaning the house from top to bottom for Christmas Eve. Went to the grocery store early to get items for the holiday weekend. I seem to be very slow this year with my fall cleaning so have been trying to catch up the past month washing curtains, windows and scrubbing down walls and floors. Seems to be more work than usual with my hip problem. Allen worked in the barn cleaning and repairing supplies they will need for the sale next week. Allen washed the cows that will be in the sale next week. After they are washed, he uses a blower that is like a giant hair dryer and blows the cows dry. The cows hair must be clean for clipping. The sale cattle and calves are kept in pens in the show barn where the manure is cleaned each morning and evening. This helps keep the cattle clean. The vet was coming today around 4:00 to check over the sale cattle and leave the health papers needed for the sale. After the vet left, Allen put out more round bales and finished feeding the cows. Checked the waterers and tanks and picked pens in the show barn. This cold weather means busting ice in mornings and evenings in the water tanks, thank goodness we only have a few that we use now since we put in the automatic waterer. Allen in the house by 6:30, steak for dinner. Carrie called later in evening. They have been clipping on their sale cattle and have had buyers out at farm for steer calves. Something broke on their large tractor loader that they use to put out round bales, she said it was $6000 to fix it. Costly equipment repairs can really hurt!

Another cold morning. Allen up early to get his chores done before Scott comes out to clip. Allen had the cows ready for clipping when Scott arrived around 10:00. They stopped for a quick bite of lunch and clipped until about 3:00. The 2 cows are clipped and ready to go for the sale. Allen and Scott are very pleased with how they look and hopeful they sell well in the sale. My sister and family, along with Scott, Sheri and Cole are coming over for Christmas Eve. We have been following the weather all day since they were calling for snow. My sister is traveling from near Hillsboro and worried about the drive home. I cleaned and made cookies. Made all the other goodies we were having for the evening. Allen finished his chores for the day and in the house around 4:30. Had a very nice evening with family and enjoyed opening gifts and just visiting. We all enjoyed watching Cole open gifts and the expression on his face. We bought him a new coat for Christmas that has Minges Show Cattle on the back and his name on the front. He had to wear it for a while then finally decided he was getting hot and took it off. We have been showing and selling cattle as Minges Show Cattle since 1989 and our kids always enjoyed having coats with our name on it. Good advertising! We played games and everyone went home around 10:30. Roads were in good shape and we only had a dusting of snow.

Merry Christmas! Allen up early to feed. Even on holidays, the livestock is fed just like any other day and chores have to be done. Allen worked in barn for a while getting more supplies ready that will be loaded into our livestock trailer. I baked a pie that I was taking over to my parents for lunch with family. Allen finished his chores we left for my parents around noon. Like always at my parents, too much food and too many gifts! Allen left their house around 4:00 to go home and do his evening chores before we headed up to his sister's house for the Minges Christmas get-together. Carrie was not able to make it home for Christmas but we talked with her before we left for the day. They will be spending Christmas Day at the Baker family and also spending part of the day clipping cattle. Scott, Sheri and Cole came to my parents late in the afternoon after spending the day with her family. Cole fell asleep on the trip there, worn out from all the presents and excitment. They went to the Minges side and we all went home around 10:00.
Sunday, December 26, 2010
Allen up early to do the feeding and put out round bales. He washed the bred heifer that will sell in the sale and blew her dry so that Scott could clip her later that morning. Bitter cold today and the wind is really whipping around. Snow blowing over the roads. Scott and Allen clipped until around 3:00. They decided to wait until Monday to clip the open heifer. After clipping, they started loading supplies on our livestock trailer. Our dog Chloe, an Australian Shepherd, is Allen's shadow when he is out doing the chores. She likes to know what is going on. We originally bought her for Scott to go with his working border collie dog Jake. She was only out at Scott's for a few months, she liked to chase birds more than anything and was a distraction for his dog. Scott's cattle dog is really something to watch. He is his right-hand man and we credit him with saving Scott from serious injury a few years ago. Scott was loading several large bulls on a trailer when one of the bulls kicked back full force as he was trying to latch the door, hitting Scott in the forehead and knocking him out. His dog kept the bulls from stepping back off the trailer onto Scott until someone could get there to get him out of the way. Scott was okay, he just had stitches all the way across his forehead. You always have to be careful around cattle, especially bulls and cows with calves. We have raised a few bulls, but generally castrate our bull calves and sell them for steers. We just don't have the facilities to accommodate bulls and I don't like them around. Allen finished his evening chores and in the house early. We had to go to Harrison and get new bulbs for the lights they will use at the sale and decided to eat while we were down there. Carrie called in the evening to say they were just returning from picking up heifers on the eastern side of Indy. They will be clipping non-stop until Tuesday morning to have all the cattle ready. Glad the weather forecast shows warmer weather on Thursday. They will have to wash, blow-dry and fit 20 head of cattle before the 1:00 PM sale, which means they will probably start around 3:00 AM or earlier

Diary of Cathy Minges - Week 4 - December 20-26
Monday, December 20, 2010
Allen did his barn chores before he left for work. Another cold day with a lot of snow on the ground that is not going anywhere anytime soon! I worked at the FB office. Short week for me with the holidays. Allen will finish the week on Thursday. After work Allen worked on the livestock trailer. The back doors seem a little loose and he is tightening up the bolts. Not a very easy task as the bolts are behind a welded piece with no easy access to them. I went to Harrison after work to pick up a few last minute supplies. Allen put out round bales of hay and then went to get some straw they will need for the sale next week. Wyatt is having a semi trailer haul his cattle in, we may meet the trailer north of Eaton on I-70 to put our 4 head on for the trip to Zanesville. Scott will pull a gooseneck trailer with the big supplies they will need such as: chutes, generators, blowers, space heaters, straw and hay. Allen will pull our livestock trailer with other supplies they will need. We join together with Carrie and Wyatt on supplies since we all help each other. Allen did his evening feeding and checked bedding and water. Allen and Scott will start clipping later in the week for transport on next Tuesday. It takes a good 3-4 hours or more to clip on each head, plus the calf has to be washed and blown dry thoroughly before you can clip. Clipping takes a lot of practice and patience and can be very meticulous. Allen does a little prep clipping, but Scott does the majority. A good clip job will enhance the calf and is necessity with show cattle. Wyatt was going to start his sale clipping on Sunday with all the cattle he has in the sale. Not sure if he got started, he had people looking at steers on Sunday and sold a few head. Carrie helps Wyatt clip when she can. A few years ago for her birthday he gave he a hot pink toolbox and painted all her tools and clippers hot pink for her. That is one of her favorite colors. With all of Scott's work and Allen's work week, they will probably spend a majority of the weekend clipping, along with Monday to be ready to send the cattle on Tuesday.

More snow this morning, maybe another 2-3 inches. Allen up and fed cattle and did chores before he left for work at 6:00. I worked at the FB office. Our office is closed on Wednesday so this is the last day this week for me for the Christmas holiday! After work, Allen put out round bales for the cows, fed the calves and finished his other chores before we went Christmas shopping. He said he would finish up early so we could get a good start. Early to him was around 6:30. Grabbed a bit to eat on the way and did our one stop shopping at JC Penney. After 1 1/2 hrs we were finished and Allen hopes he doesn't see another store besides Tractor Supply for at least another year. Allen and Scott already talking about the next calf crop. Depending on how the bred heifer we have in the sale will sell, we may flush the cow for eggs. They plan ahead on how they will A/I breed a cow to what bull based on the genetics of the cow and bull. They are many things you look for and if a calf turns out really well, other advanced reproductive techniques such as flushing for more eggs to try to get the same quality calves for embryo transfers with recip cows. This can be a costly venture and we only consider this option with cows that are super-producers. Breeders will purchase their bull semen from catalogs with the genetics of the bull along with other EPD's (Expected Progeny Differences) such as: birth weight, weaning weight, yearly weight, milking ability, calving ease and other data used to make the calculations. You have to be careful breeding a heifer or small cow to bulls that produce large calves. This can cause real problems at birth in which you can loose the calf and possibly the cow or heifer.
Wednesday, December 22, 2010
Allen fed and did his other chores before leaving for work. This is his last full work day at his job before the holiday. He was at the Zoo again today and will return there on Jan. 3. His company is closed down for the week between Christmas and New Year. This will work out well for him with the upcoming cattle sale next week. I met Sheri to pick-up Cole for the day. I took Cole down to Ross for a haircut and we had to go to the bank. Afterwards we worked on painting ornaments that he is giving to family for the holidays. I did the usual Wednesday chores, cleaned, laundry and put our fresh Christmas greens for decorations in the house. Love the evergreen smell. After lunch we went over to visit my parents, something he loves to do and looks forward to each week. After Allen returned home from work a little later than usual, he did his feeding and other chores for the evening. Allen met Sheri to drop-off Cole and also load our semen tank in her vehicle for Scott. Sheri is finished with this semester of school so she is off work on Wednesdays a little earlier now. It weighs about 40 pounds and currently has about 100 straws of semen in the tank. The tank is filled with nitrogen gas to keep the semen froze for proper storage. A straw of semen can cost between $20 and $100, or much more, depending on the quality of the bulls. We insure the semen tank as a separate rider on our insurance policy, when it is full, you can have a lot of money at stake. I made pancakes and sausage for supper, hit the spot. Nice to be home for the evening. The cattle are all doing very well and tolerating the bitter cold weather, much better than we are.
Thursday, December 23, 2010
Allen was able to sleep in a little today and got up at 6:00 to feed and do other barn chores. They have a short day at work today. He and other co-workers met down at the little restaurant in Okeana for their annual breakfast get-together before they go into work. They have a short company meeting then a catered meal before their holiday break. Allen returned home around 12:30 to head out to the barn. He put more round bales out and had to put out some more corn stalk bales for bedding. Keeping dry bedding for the cattle is always a priority. I was off today and star

I know they already offer a cruise link service for P&O Cruises, Princess and Cunard, but offering the service for the other cruise lines that homeport ships in Southampton can’t come soon enough and I am very excited about it. It’s going to give cruisers so much more choice when it comes to deciding which ship to pick and more importantly, take away the hassle of things like rail and longer journey options to and from the port.
I have never had a bad experience with Eavesway or arrived at the port later than scheduled and best of all, I have never been ticked off for the fact my bags are usually over weight, OK! Always overweight! 😉 They have a 20kg weight limit per bag, however passengers can bring as much luggage as they like unless the cruise is over 21 nights in which case it is restricted to 3 cases per person.
I would recommend Eavesway to everyone. If you usually drive to Southampton and park your car at the port then for your next cruise just give Eavesway a try, I am positive you will never use the car again. You meet your coach, your luggage is loaded for you and that’s the last time you will see it until it magically appears outside your cabin. It’s so hassle free that even if you lose your ticket it doesn’t matter because they will have you on their list. It really couldn’t be any more convenient.
This is the link to the Eavesway 2013 newsletter. It contains information on fare prices for 2014, new pick up points for 2014 and contact information should you require any further information

------------question-----------------------
What events did the mother and her children attend before the dinner with friends
------------correct----------------------
It was a meltdown of epic proportions.
And I’m not talking about my sweet Baby J turned temperamental toddler who I am thinking already has raging hormones.
Nor am I talking about my six year old son who has an impeccable flair for the dramatic.
No, this time it was mama.
It was my own fault, really.
I mean as they say – too much of a good thing is bad? (or however the hell that saying goes).
Anyway. Yes. Kids have their limits.
So I decided to cram in one more social event in an already overly scheduled day. I dragged my completely worn out kids out to dinner with friends and their completely worn out kids.
Seriously? Did I REALLY think this could possibly end well?
Again, my naivety never ceases to astound me.
The day started off great – my friend Nan and I took Baby J and our two youngest boys to Nonni’s for a tour of their factory to learn how they make their to-die-for biscotti (thanks T-Town Moms!).
The magic is done all right here in Tulsa, Oklahoma, people. Think Willy Wonka minus the creepy voice and the Oompa Loompas.
After 2 hours of learning how to make the heavenly twice-baked goodness (and chasing Baby J around the factory, trying to keep her hairnet on and keeping Nicholas out of the massive vat of chocolate) – most people would have called it a day.
But we were just getting started.
Lunch at Nan’s house.
Two hours at the pool in the 100 plus degree weather.
Another playdate at our house…four kids playing Survival Man while Baby J tried to sleep. You can imagine that scenario.
And of course I didn’t stop there. Because I’m an idiot.
Fast forward to our Super Fun Relaxing Dinner with Friends and All Their Kids. An Oxymoron at its best.
Nicholas cried the entire way to Elote (my favorite restaurant – in downtown Tulsa) because his friends left. Josie just cried.
Six tired kids. One unhappy baby. Four frazzled parents. You do the math.
I’m pretty sure our photo is posted to the hostess stand with the note: “Do Not Seat

------------question-----------------------
What is Miles' attitude toward the family's move and how does his demeanor help during this transition
------------correct----------------------
is a good compromise for being close to each other and eventually spending much more time as a family.
Miles—I believe— is just along for the ride. His good nature and relative flexibility are a godsend right now. He knows we are moving, and sometimes jokes about going early or not at all. I’m pretty sure he’s gauging our reaction, but we just play it cool.
The house is of course a disaster. There’s nothing like a good comprehensive purge to reduce a seemingly orderly life to smoldering piles of Cerberean effluence.

I have read a bit about this kind of purging, and don’t recall anyone speaking of any kind of effluence, so I felt it important to add that note to the record.
On the boat there will be quite literally no place for disorder. At least not if we want to sail, and oh how I want to sail. Our stated goal is to keep the boat ready to sail within one hour. From what I gather, this is not a reasonable goal, but its ours and we’re sticking to it… for now 😉

is a good compromise for being close to each other and eventually spending much more time as a family.
Miles—I believe— is just along for the ride. His good nature and relative flexibility are a godsend right now. He knows we are moving, and sometimes jokes about going early or not at all. I’m pretty sure he’s gauging our reaction, but we just play it cool.
The house is of course a disaster. There’s nothing like a good comprehensive purge to reduce a seemingly orderly life to smoldering piles of Cerberean effluence.

me makes the economy less efficient. “Leaving earned days on the table,” he argues, “harms, not helps, employers by creating a less productive and less loyal employee.”
It seems that the American work ethic and job worries provide an unhealthy pressure, making them less likely to take time off. When Americans do take time off, many of them still answer emails and complete other work-related tasks. This all-work mentality has serious implications for companies, employees, and the overall economy.
A report in Forbes concluded that if employees took an additional day off each year, the U.S. economy would benefit with an extra $73 billion in output and advantages to both employees and businesses.
Benefits of Holidays
There are many obvious benefits to vacations. Individuals often mention feeling more relaxed, productive, and happy. There is also research that shows that annual holidays significantly decrease the risk of heart attacks in both men and women. Vacationers also report lower blood pressure, improved mental health, less stress, and enhanced energy.
Companies with individuals who take time off also experience lower burnout rates and higher retention. Nevertheless, according to National Geographic, don’t look for quick solutions immediately after a vacation. The study shows that the recuperative benefits of a vacation start kicking in after two weeks.
So…stop reading this and take some time off!

What are the main issues facing higher education according to the text
------------correct----------------------
Submitted by Charles Hugh-Smith of OfTwoMinds blog,
Once we accredit the student, not the institution, existing universities will compete directly with Nearly Free Universities not in issuing diplomas but in how much students actually learned and mastered.
One of the key insights from recent work in psychology is that humans tend to substitute easier problems rather than solve difficult problems. Daniel Kahneman explained this dynamic in his recent book Thinking, Fast and Slow.
To "solve" a difficult problem we are unfamiliar with, we substitute a lesser problem we already know the answer to, and then declare we've "solved" the original (often knotty, complex) problem.
The real problem then festers, unsolved and addressed, while the misguided "solution" only drains resources and exacerbates the real problem.
An excellent example of this dynamic is higher education: the real problems are soaring costs and sharply declining yields in actual learning and in the real-world value of a diploma.
Consider the study Academically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses which concluded that "American higher education is characterized by limited or no learning for a large proportion of students."
These charts illustrate the costs and diminishing returns:
The yield (in earnings) on the increasingly unaffordable college degree is declining sharply:
The Status Quo has substituted two false "solutions" that completely ignore the real problems of soaring costs and diminishing returns: increasing student loans and hiring hundreds of thousands of non-teaching administrators.
While student loans have soared to over $1 trillion, with direct Federal loans ballooning from $115 billion to over $700 billion in a few short years, only 37% of freshmen at four-year colleges graduate in four years (58% finally graduate in six years), and 53% of recent college graduates under the age of 25 are unemployed or doing work they could have done without going to college.
New Analysis Shows Problematic Boom In Higher Ed Administrators:
In all, from 1987 until 2011-12--the most recent academic year for which comparable figures are available—universities and colleges collectively added 517,636 administrators and professional employees, according to the analysis by the New England Center for Investigative Reporting.
“There’s just a mind-boggling amount of money per student that’s being spent on administration,” said Andrew Gillen, a senior researcher at the institutes. “It raises a question of priorities.”
The ratio of nonacademic employees to faculty has also doubled. There are now two nonacademic employees at public and two and a half at private universities and colleges for every one full-tim

mbers of detainees. Overcrowding and poor conditions have been repeatedly condemned by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. But with a dizzying average of 3,000 new incarcerations each month, the situation is becoming more horrendous by the day. The Brazilian criminal justice and penal system has been repeatedly criticised for its failings, including by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Conectas and Justica Global, not least for violating the government's legal responsibility to protect human rights.
Not all of Brazil's incarcerated population suffers equally. The penal system is intrinsically elitist. The minority of detainees with a university diploma or public connections are often issued separate cells and better conditions. The poor are seldom afforded such treatment. One study found that more than 80 per cent of prisoners could not afford to hire a lawyer. Making matters worse, there are no public defenders in more than 70 per cent of all judicial jurisdictions. It's hardly surprising, then, that those killed in custody tend to be poorer Brazilians, a sobering finding of the United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions.
A rash of federal and state investigations has confirmed that the penal system is disastrously overcrowded, stacked against the poor and rife with police brutality. So why do the deplorable conditions persist? One reason may be that Brazilian society tolerates the status quo. Criminals, so the argument goes, are simply unworthy of public concern. Opinion polls confirm that many Brazilians support tough penalties, prefer punishment over rehabilitation and accept that police abuses may occur. And Brazil's politicians lack not the material resources but the political and moral resolve to do the right thing.
Turning around Brazil's backward penal system will require a dramatic shift in public attitudes. If popular pressure is applied on politicians, entrenched resistance can be overcome. But real change requires political leadership. President Dilma Rousseff, who was imprisoned and tortured during the dictatorship era, pledged to improve prison conditions. Sadly, she has yet to move the agenda forward.
If she does, reforms should focus on reducing overcrowding and improving conditions. At the federal level, much-needed changes in drug legislation could drastically reduce the nonviolent-offender caseload. States should be encouraged to adopt alternatives to pretrial detention and invest in non-custodial sentencing and rehabilitation programs.
Even Justice Minister Jose Eduardo Cardozo recently said he'd rather die than be condemned to a Brazilian prison.
The justice system need not be reinvented. What is required is the implementation of key provisions of the constitution, not least the safeguarding of basic rights that all Brazilians are entitled to.

mal behavioural norms or even the establishment of site-specific policing, security and vigilante services (Wall & Williams 2007).
Johnson and Post (1996) used net-federalism to describe the decentralised regulatory nature of the internet. Figure 1 indicates this model can be easily adapted to explain regulatory approaches in 3dves.
Under the net-federalism model, layers of site-specific governance are developed by user communities within the 3dve platform. These are overlaid by the platform's ToS and EULAs which, in turn, co-exist with four generic forms of regulatory control to promote good conduct and site security: formal law, market forces, informal norms and digital code (Lessig 1999).
Recent law enforcement literature indicates decentralised policing and security arrangements exist in all realms of contemporary social life. This tends to occur when conventional forms of centralised policing no longer meet the crime prevention needs of diverse communities (Shearing & Wood 2003), or where 'opportunistic' forms of third-party policing evolve to support specific interests of the state or concerned social groups (Mazerolle & Ransley 2006).
The sheer technical sophistication and variety of digital coding mechanisms and site-specific conduct norms to identify and prevent harmful activity also ensure considerable levels of 'responsibilisation' are actively promoted by the very structure of 3dve platforms (O'Malley & Palmer 1996). This means individual users or user-groups do not require extensive scrutiny or intervention by formal justice agencies or site administrators in response to the majority of 3dve harms. Provided they have the technical knowledge, user groups are arguably best situated to develop viable forms of digital coding or site-specific norms to prevent harm to digital infrastructure or other users (Wall & Williams 2007).
A typology of 3dve harm
In a decentralised and highly technical environment with high levels of user 'responsibilisation' for harm identification, prevention and the development of appropriate norms of good conduct, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding role of the criminal law in these multi-user platforms. This uncertainty is compounded by the wide range of regulatory choices available to users, confusion over the real-world implications of much of the behaviour within 3dves, the transnational appeal and jurisdictional uncertainties associated with these emerging media and the broader lack of empirical research documenting how 3dve users perceive issues relating to harm, risk, safety and governance.
The body of knowledge on each of these issues is so recent that it is premature to speculate on the ideal role of the criminal law in this field. Nevertheless, a basic typology of harms associated with 3dve use can help to clarify the various regulatory and harm-prevention strategies available to individuals, user communities and formal justice agencies.
Table 1 outlines a graded series of harms associated with 3dve use, ranging from behaviours with purely in-world implications considered too trivial to warrant formal action, to those with clearly actionable consequences under the criminal law. Within these extremes, a grey area of inter-real harms bridges the virtual and the real. Inter-real harms differ from conventional cybercrimes due to the peculiarly immersive character of 3dve technologies. How 3dve users view the severity of these harms is the most appropriate measure of the ideal regulatory approach in any given case.
Harms mediated by the technical or coding mechanisms facilitated by the platform should remain subject to current disciplinary and complaints processes established by platform administrators or under ToS agreements. For example, while activities such as digital cloning might generate fears that 3dves facilitate widespread and persistent identity thefts, systematic frauds, obscene behaviour or predatory real-world conduct (Wall 2008; Yar 2008), these nuisances are best prevented through rigorous internal digital coding modifications or informal policing, enforcement and dispute resolution methods (Wall & Williams 2007).
|Types of harm||Conduct||Proposed outcome|
|Purely in-world harm||Cloning, theft, appropriation or damage to digital property of limited value or which can be easily replaced, breach of gaming rules (cheating), innocuous harassment, obscenity (flying genitalia, bots)||Internal regulation by user groups (including eviction), ToS, EULAs or formal discipline, methods of coding to prevent harm developed by platform managers|
|Inter-real harm||Conduct affecting avatars or property with real world physical or economic consequences: includes virtual rape, assault, sexual harassment, fraud and deception, destruction of property, abusive or threatening speech||Real-world impact must be measurable and substantial to justify formal intervention beyond the ToS, EULA and site management complaint processes|
|Criminal harm||Conspiracies or threats to engage in crime against the person, property, the state, communication networks or children: includes stalking, privacy, piracy and copyright violations, money laundering, disabling or tampering with 3dve platforms||Conventional criminal laws subject to jurisdictional issues and the severity or prevalence of the conduct. Internet Service Providers or platform managers to provide evidence of real-world offending|
The rape of an avatar may produce some real-world physical discomfort or shock among unsuspecting or novice users (Boellstorff 2008: 189). This could be prevented through modifying simulation codes, in- or real-world counselling to deal with psychological or emotional harms or improved education about recognised risks for new 3dve users. Formal criminal intervention would only have a place if an appreciable and measurable effect on the real-world victim could be established, or if the violation clearly falls under the established criminal provisions targeting harmful online conduct (Criminal Code 1995 Part 10.6).
Similarly, most cases of financial deception or the purchase of faulty virtual goods in 3dves will involve a minor in-world financial penalty in the order of Linden$10. Market force and greater education for vulnerable users will play a more useful harm-prevention role than the enforcement of ToS agreements or any formal legal provisions.
In contrast, systematic and organised scams aimed at using 3dves as a means of making illicit profits or for laundering real- and virtual-world money clearly have coverage under existing criminal laws. Here, the major complexity lies in assessing the scale of harm to justify a formal criminal investigation. In such cases, Internet Service Providers and platform administrators would provide crucial support to investigators aiming to establish a successful prosecution satisfying the criminal burden of proof.
The various strands associated with harm, safety, immersion and regulation in 3dves greatly extend our conventional understanding of cybercrime. Three pertinent issues should underscore future research in this field.
The first involves enhancing our understanding of the nature of harm within multi-user 3dve platforms. Our preliminary typology and the work of ENISA (2008) provide useful starting points. ENISA's detailed report recommended the development of industry-wide standards to prevent intellectual property violations, spamming, poor user authentication procedures, automated attacks and in-world harassment, along with greater legal clarity of each of these issues.
Future research should also assess perceptions of harm, risk and appropriate educational and prevention strategies amongst 3dve users. This is crucial, given most calls for increased regulation of new technologies are made by those with little direct experience or understanding of how they are used or how they might cause harm (Wall 2008; Yar 2008).

ian targets, child recruitment and kidnapping, and
The LTTE randomly targeted women and children, rural communities,
places of worship, and mass transportation including trains, buses and
bus stations. Babies were separated from breast feeding mothers and
hacked to death.
Their violence was random and unprovoked.
Their purpose was to cause havoc through random fear. This was their
morality. But at what cost! Do any events that happened in the past
justify this horrific violence against innocent Sri Lankans?
The worst consequence of LTTE terrorist campaign has been the
destruction of our long-developed social capital.
For example, personal relations between friends, neighbours and
families have been affected due to growing mistrust and suspicion among
ethnic groups, police and community relations have suffered due to
detachment of police from the community, political leaders have become
isolated from the public, people have lost access to their
representatives and public servants, barriers have prevented free
movement and socialization, multi community integration through
participation at religious ceremonies such as Vesak and Madu
celebrations and visits to multi religious places of worship such as
Kataragama, Sri Pada and Anuradhapura have been adversely affected, and
people have kept away from large community gatherings due to fear of
Loss of contact among people and between communities have affected
individual and collective productivity due to loss of employment, trade
Social functions such as Shrama Dana, through which people help each
other with various projects by donating labour, have ceased. Many
social, cultural and public institutions have crumbled under the weight
As a result of LTTE terror, communities that have the capacity to
peacefully co-exist have become sharply divided and grown suspicious of
each other. Violence has become a common norm in some urban areas. There
is a decline of civic engagement and our social and cultural
institutions have begun to crumble. Consequently it has created a
political culture that is authoritative and repressive. This
transformation seems to have occurred during the last three decades at
an accelerated pace. What should a democratically elected Government do
under these circumstances?
Successive governments in the last three decades have attempted to
tackle the LTTE problem.
They have attempted military and non-military options including peace
negotiations and the introduction of new constitutional and legal
frameworks. None of these were successful for various reasons. Peace
negotiations were unsuccessful mainly due to lack of forthright dealing
by the LTTE.
Finally the present Government led by President Mahinda Rajapaksa has
managed to wipe out LTTE terror from Sri Lanka by acting with laster
like focus and sheer determination on the task at hand.
The feat of the LTTE and the eradication of terrorism from our soil
are significant historical events because the major cause of the
dissipation and destruction of social capital has been removed.
We have reached an important milestone in our history. Presently we
are passing through a time when the hard fought victories against
vicious terror must be solidified to ensure that terrorism will never
again raise its ugly head in Sri Lanka.
We have suffered enough. It is crucial that every peace loving Sri
Lankan bond together with the Government in its effort to guarantee
everlasting peaceful co-existence under one banner of unity.
Otherwise all of the valuable lives, limbs and property lost and the
sorrow of families disjointed and scattered in the last three decades,
and the valiant efforts of those who fought will be in vain. May not the
lives and tearers of innocent mothers, fathers and children go to waste.
It will be the worst crime against humanity ever in the history of
Obviously rebuilding social capital by improving trust among and
within communities and by improving the sense of personal security takes
more hard work than building economic capital.
Nevertheless building social capital will enhance personal and
collective productivity, bring lasting peace and prosperity, and improve
the quality of life of every Sri Lankan citizen.
Crushing the LTTE terrorism militarily was a daunting task that
required enormous sacrifices and hard work.
Now, the same leadership can take us to a resurgent Sri Lanka through
building social capital on a foundation of national unity. Social
capital can be revitalised through economic development and through
social and legal frameworks. First I will discuss economic development.
Now that the military war is over it is time to rearrange budgetary
priorities and spend the war capital wisely.
In this respect it is laudable to note that the Government in
cooperation with the private sector has already embarked on various
development projects aimed at erecting infrastructures, building homes,
schools and places of worship in the areas of the North and East that
have been seriously affected by war.
In addition, various development schemes are under way to bring
economic well being to rural areas specially in the dry zone and at the
periphery that have been neglected for a long period of time.
Successive Governments of Sri Lanka have neglected development at the
periphery. Industrialization has focused around urban centres.

What measures are being taken to address the parking shortages for Gautrain users at the Centurion, Pretoria, and Rhodesfield stations
------------correct----------------------
More parking bays for Gautrain usersComment on this story
Cape Town - Land has been obtained for additional parking at Gautrain stations in Centurion, Pretoria and Rhodesfield stations.
Several feasibility studies are also on the cards, the findings of which will guide plans to increase capacity of Africa’s first rapid rail system.
Barbara Jensen, spokeswoman for the Gautrain Management Agency, said necessary studies such as the environmental and transport impact assessments would be undertaken in due course at the three locations.
The Gautrain system includes about 10 000 parking bays spread across all stations.
But parking facilities at the Pretoria, Centurion and Rhodesfield stations are filled to capacity, and occasionally at Rosebank and Park stations, Jensen said.
The move to increase parking and overall capacity followed complaints from passengers about parking shortages, as well as overcrowding in trains.
Such is the popularity of the Gautrain that its usage surpassed all expectations – the current average weekday use varies between 54 000 and 56 000 train passengers and about 21 000 bus passengers.
Already train services are being operated at levels originally anticipated only in 2026, according to the Gautrain Management Agency.
This growth in passenger demand has been attributed to the project’s focus on key customer satisfaction cri

What are some benefits of taking time off from work according to the text

me makes the economy less efficient. “Leaving earned days on the table,” he argues, “harms, not helps, employers by creating a less productive and less loyal employee.”
It seems that the American work ethic and job worries provide an unhealthy pressure, making them less likely to take time off. When Americans do take time off, many of them still answer emails and complete other work-related tasks. This all-work mentality has serious implications for companies, employees, and the overall economy.
A report in Forbes concluded that if employees took an additional day off each year, the U.S. economy would benefit with an extra $73 billion in output and advantages to both employees and businesses.
Benefits of Holidays
There are many obvious benefits to vacations. Individuals often mention feeling more relaxed, productive, and happy. There is also research that shows that annual holidays significantly decrease the risk of heart attacks in both men and women. Vacationers also report lower blood pressure, improved mental health, less stress, and enhanced energy.
Companies with individuals who take time off also experience lower burnout rates and higher retention. Nevertheless, according to National Geographic, don’t look for quick solutions immediately after a vacation. The study shows that the recuperative benefits of a vacation start kicking in after two weeks.
So…stop reading this and take some time off!

What is the potential consequence of aggressive removal of scarring after a radical prostatectomy
------------correct----------------------
e been tried to help prevent this, however the results are not very successful. Utilizing a different energy source such as a laser may provide some advantage.** I am not sure if you have had a TURP or a radical prostatectomy. If it were a TURP, a more complete resection of the prostate can be helpful. If you had treatment with a radical prostatectomy, this becomes an extremely challenging problem because if the removal of the scarring is too aggressive, permanent incontinence can occur. Various prostatic stents are available that may also be helpful.**

Leaders focus on a resurgent Sri Lanka:
Building social capital on the foundation of national unity
The following are excerpts from this year’s D.
A. Rajapaksa memorial oration delivered on November 11 at the BMICH by
Professor Karunaratne Hangawatte of the Department of Criminal Justice,
University of Nevada, Las Vegas, US.
I am honoured humbled by the invitation to deliver this year’s Hon.
D.A. Rajapaksa oration on this solemn occasion commemorating the life
and legacy of the late Mr. Rajapaksa.
This year’s commemoration ceremony is very significant, because the
year 2009 marks an important milestone of the history of Sri Lanka.
Driven by the legacy of the Late D.A. Rajapaksa, his progeny have led
the way to finally free the nation from the grip of violent and vicious
terror that has plagued Sri Lanka for several decades.
It is no secret that the national and international community stands
in gratitude and salutes Your Excellency for your unwavering leadership,
our defense leaders and personnel for their enormous sacrifices, the
public servants, and the civic community that bore the burdens of untold
The concept of social capital
The late Hon. D.A. Rajapaksa has left an exemplary legacy of public
service and a set of values rooted in Sri lankan heritage.
Sri Lankan heritage is rooted in Buddhism, and is influenced by the
philosophical doctrines and practices of Hinduism, Christianity and
It is particularly characterised by the values of compassion, unity
and caring for others.
Over the last three decades LTTE terrorism has for the most part
retarded this legacy, destroyed the economy and economic development,
and severely damaged the social capital of Sri Lanka.
President Mahinda Rajapaksa has a sharp intellect that is
native to rural folks of Sri Lanka
Social capital in this context refers to social networks, community
and civic order that strengthen and integrate communities while helping
individuals achieve their goals. In this sense social networks have
value just the same way economic capital has value.
Social capital comprises the networks of association and cohesion
These include social, cultural and community networks, and community
relations that foster trust and a sense of belonging.
The norms, values and networks developed within and between different
ethnic and religious communities, and the personal relationships that
aid in achieving community goals can generally be conceptualized as
social capital. Social contacts that occur through social networking
have value because they affect both individual and collective
Social capital is not a single explanation or variable, it is how
informal human social relationships are important to the quality of life
of the entire community.
Just as economic capital and investment brings economic riches,
social capital building by improving social networks and cohesion
improves the quality of life for everyone throughout the country.
The next logical step is to eradicate any lingering terrorist
environments and violent ideologies from our culture and society.
In this respect it is very heartening to notice that, in the noblest
traditions of our heritage, President Mahinda Rajapaksa has no dedicated
the legacy and the spirit of public service that he has inherited from
his father, the late D.A. Rajapaksa to develop “social capital” through
unity. In my view, carrying the military defeat of terrorism to its
ultimate goal of establishing peace, unity and prosperity through social
capital building will be the best celebration of the life of late D.A.
Over the course of centuries Sri Lankan communities have been bound
in cohesion and enriched social capital.
Sri Lanka is a multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-cultural
society. Buddha preached (Atthahi Atthano Natho) the importance of
compassion towards others while having faith in self and the importance
of self examination of truths. The Bhagwad Gita is a set of teachings
about the performance of one’s duties, without attachment and without
any heed to the rewards that might follow. It is a sense of duty towards
our fellow beings, both human and non human. The Biblical concept of
covenant teaches love, loyalty, responsibility, and compassion among
those who join in covenantal relationships. It is a bond of belonging.
North African Scholar Ibn Khaldun referred to asabiyya, an Arabic term
for the spirit of kinship or social bonding in fourteenth century Islam.
Human relationships in Sri Lanka are heavily influenced by these
ethos and values that are built into our mixed heritage.
This is our heritage and it runs in our blood. Our heritage has
evolved over thousands of years. Colonial influences could not destroy
The Sri Lankan people have weathered foreign invasions, incursions
and encroachments, and various communities have lived together in
harmony for centuries bound by a common social experience.
LTTE terrorism and social capital
The strength of Sri Lankan social capital has gradually developed and
shined through thousands of years. But it has been weakened and damaged
by the LTTE in just three decades.

ted cleaning the house from top to bottom for Christmas Eve. Went to the grocery store early to get items for the holiday weekend. I seem to be very slow this year with my fall cleaning so have been trying to catch up the past month washing curtains, windows and scrubbing down walls and floors. Seems to be more work than usual with my hip problem. Allen worked in the barn cleaning and repairing supplies they will need for the sale next week. Allen washed the cows that will be in the sale next week. After they are washed, he uses a blower that is like a giant hair dryer and blows the cows dry. The cows hair must be clean for clipping. The sale cattle and calves are kept in pens in the show barn where the manure is cleaned each morning and evening. This helps keep the cattle clean. The vet was coming today around 4:00 to check over the sale cattle and leave the health papers needed for the sale. After the vet left, Allen put out more round bales and finished feeding the cows. Checked the waterers and tanks and picked pens in the show barn. This cold weather means busting ice in mornings and evenings in the water tanks, thank goodness we only have a few that we use now since we put in the automatic waterer. Allen in the house by 6:30, steak for dinner. Carrie called later in evening. They have been clipping on their sale cattle and have had buyers out at farm for steer calves. Something broke on their large tractor loader that they use to put out round bales, she said it was $6000 to fix it. Costly equipment repairs can really hurt!

Another cold morning. Allen up early to get his chores done before Scott comes out to clip. Allen had the cows ready for clipping when Scott arrived around 10:00. They stopped for a quick bite of lunch and clipped until about 3:00. The 2 cows are clipped and ready to go for the sale. Allen and Scott are very pleased with how they look and hopeful they sell well in the sale. My sister and family, along with Scott, Sheri and Cole are coming over for Christmas Eve. We have been following the weather all day since they were calling for snow. My sister is traveling from near Hillsboro and worried about the drive home. I cleaned and made cookies. Made all the other goodies we were having for the evening. Allen finished his chores for the day and in the house around 4:30. Had a very nice evening with family and enjoyed opening gifts and just visiting. We all enjoyed watching Cole open gifts and the expression on his face. We bought him a new coat for Christmas that has Minges Show Cattle on the back and his name on the front. He had to wear it for a while then finally decided he was getting hot and took it off. We have been showing and selling cattle as Minges Show Cattle since 1989 and our kids always enjoyed having coats with our name on it. Good advertising! We played games and everyone went home around 10:30. Roads were in good shape and we only had a dusting of snow.

Merry Christmas! Allen up early to feed. Even on holidays, the livestock is fed just like any other day and chores have to be done. Allen worked in barn for a while getting more supplies ready that will be loaded into our livestock trailer. I baked a pie that I was taking over to my parents for lunch with family. Allen finished his chores we left for my parents around noon. Like always at my parents, too much food and too many gifts! Allen left their house around 4:00 to go home and do his evening chores before we headed up to his sister's house for the Minges Christmas get-together. Carrie was not able to make it home for Christmas but we talked with her before we left for the day. They will be spending Christmas Day at the Baker family and also spending part of the day clipping cattle. Scott, Sheri and Cole came to my parents late in the afternoon after spending the day with her family. Cole fell asleep on the trip there, worn out from all the presents and excitment. They went to the Minges side and we all went home around 10:00.

Allen up early to do the feeding and put out round bales. He washed the bred heifer that will sell in the sale and blew her dry so that Scott could clip her later that morning. Bitter cold today and the wind is really whipping around. Snow blowing over the roads. Scott and Allen clipped until around 3:00. They decided to wait until Monday to clip the open heifer. After clipping, they started loading supplies on our livestock trailer. Our dog Chloe, an Australian Shepherd, is Allen's shadow when he is out doing the chores. She likes to know what is going on. We originally bought her for Scott to go with his working border collie dog Jake. She was only out at Scott's for a few months, she liked to chase birds more than anything and was a distraction for his dog. Scott's cattle dog is really something to watch. He is his right-hand man and we credit him with saving Scott from serious injury a few years ago. Scott was loading several large bulls on a trailer when one of the bulls kicked back full force as he was trying to latch the door, hitting Scott in the forehead and knocking him out. His dog kept the bulls from stepping back off the trailer onto Scott until someone could get there to get him out of the way. Scott was okay, he just had stitches all the way across his forehead. You always have to be careful around cattle, especially bulls and cows with calves. We have raised a few bulls, but generally castrate our bull calves and sell them for steers. We just don't have the facilities to accommodate bulls and I don't like them around. Allen finished his evening chores and in the house early. We had to go to Harrison and get new bulbs for the lights they will use at the sale and decided to eat while we were down there. Carrie called in the evening to say they were just returning from picking up heifers on the eastern side of Indy. They will be clipping non-stop until Tuesday morning to have all the cattle ready. Glad the weather forecast shows warmer weather on Thursday. They will have to wash, blow-dry and fit 20 head of cattle before the 1:00 PM sale, which means they will probably start around 3:00 AM or earlier

What plans are being proposed to address overcrowding on existing train routes
------------correct----------------------
teria such as safety, reliability and cost effectiveness, and external factors such as the cost of fuel and the introduction of e-tolling.
To address these problems, feasibility studies will commence soon into the introduction of new routes, Jensen said. Proposals include extending the line from the existing stations at Park to Westgate, Rhodesfield to Boksburg as well as Sandton to Randburg and Honeydew.
The fourth line will link Naledi in Soweto and Mamelodi using either a proposed new station at Samrand or the existing one at Midrand.
Jensen said studies would “most probably” take more than a year to complete.
“Two eight-car trains were introduced in April in the morning peak hours and another in the afternoon peak periods in an attempt to alleviate overcrowding.
“Certain trains are still quite crowded, but no incidents have been reported that the hourly capacity threshold has been reached.”
The feasibility and possible introduction of a dedicated morning shuttle train between Centurion and Sandton – currently the busiest and most used route – will also be done.
The off-peak fare discount has changed from 15 percent to 20 percent when compared with the previous year, resulting in marginal fare increases on the longer distances, said Jensen.
“This option is available system-wide for commuters, except those travelling to and from the airport.”

------------question-----------------------
What recognition did the university recently achieve, and in which three categories were they honored
------------correct----------------------
It is with great pleasure and pride that I share the news that we were selected to achieve the “Great College to Work For” recognition from the Chronicle of Higher Education. We are one of only 93 institutions chosen; the list includes community colleges, private universities and public universities. This award has been given for nine years, but this is the first time we have participated in the survey. We join the University of Michigan as the state’s only institutions to earn the distinction. We were honored in three categories: compensation and benefits; facilities, workspace and security; and teaching environment. While the recognition is nice, the most satisfying piece of this award is that it is based on your responses. This is reflective of what you think of our university. My thanks to everyone who worked on this and/or took the time to complete a survey, and my deepest appreciation to everyone who comes to work each day and makes this such a special place for our students and our colleagues.
We may not have to wait long for our next national award. I send my best wishes to recent graduate Kim Salwey and the members of our student-alumni group Forever Red as they travel to Atlanta next week for the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE) Network Convention. In March, Kim won the Outstanding Student Leader award and SVSU’s Forever Red won the Outstanding Student Organization award from CASE District V, which encompasses Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Ohio and Wisconsin. Each of the district winners are now eligible for the national award in their category. We are sending 13 SVSU representatives to the conference; it is a wonderful growth opportunity for them, and we hope they report good news from the awards ceremony Saturday, Aug. 6.
Congratulations to Matt Zivich, professor of art, whose 2015 painting, "Overboard," acrylic on canvas, was chosen as one of three top-awarded art works at the University of Michigan's juried 2016 Stamps School of Art & Design Annual Alumni Show. Approximately 170 works were submitted and 68 were selected for the exhibition, which opened this week and runs through Sunday, Aug. 7 at the Argus II gallery in Ann Arbor.
As mentioned above, this is a great place to work because so many people consistently demonstrate remarkable dedication to the students we serve. Judy Youngquist, senior ESL specialist, was one of these people. She recently retired af

teria such as safety, reliability and cost effectiveness, and external factors such as the cost of fuel and the introduction of e-tolling.
To address these problems, feasibility studies will commence soon into the introduction of new routes, Jensen said. Proposals include extending the line from the existing stations at Park to Westgate, Rhodesfield to Boksburg as well as Sandton to Randburg and Honeydew.
The fourth line will link Naledi in Soweto and Mamelodi using either a proposed new station at Samrand or the existing one at Midrand.
Jensen said studies would “most probably” take more than a year to complete.
“Two eight-car trains were introduced in April in the morning peak hours and another in the afternoon peak periods in an attempt to alleviate overcrowding.
“Certain trains are still quite crowded, but no incidents have been reported that the hourly capacity threshold has been reached.”
The feasibility and possible introduction of a dedicated morning shuttle train between Centurion and Sandton – currently the busiest and most used route – will also be done.
The off-peak fare discount has changed from 15 percent to 20 percent when compared with the previous year, resulting in marginal fare increases on the longer distances, said Jensen.
“This option is available system-wide for commuters, except those travelling to and from the airport.”

this week in Honduras brought a lot of our issues to the surface. (i.e., there were some sentences being written.)
It was a gift to my heart yesterday when he chose to copy (and add to) my closing remarks.
I am choosing to believe it was precious rather than that he simply wanted to have the last word. :)
Tonight as I was tucking in said child, I acknowledged that I knew this had been an intense week of 'coaching' from me. Attempting to tap into his love of sports and competitive nature I said, "You know how coaches treat champions, right? They keep working them because they know what they are capable of. That's how I feel about your heart & character. I know God has big plans for you, we just need to work on your self control muscles. What do you think about that?"
His very serious reply was, "I think sometimes, Mama, the coaches give their champs a break too--just to see what would happen."
If his tone hadn't been so pensive, I might have been offended. It was a humbling, big gulp moment for me, but one I plan to swallow with an even bigger dose of prayer.
Don’t exasperate your children by coming down hard on them. Take them by the hand and lead them in the way of the Master.
Ephesians 6:4 The Message
I knew so much more about parenting before I was one.

------------question-----------------------
What are some main reasons for the grievances in Brazil's penal system highlighted in the text
------------correct----------------------
mbers of detainees. Overcrowding and poor conditions have been repeatedly condemned by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. But with a dizzying average of 3,000 new incarcerations each month, the situation is becoming more horrendous by the day. The Brazilian criminal justice and penal system has been repeatedly criticised for its failings, including by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Conectas and Justica Global, not least for violating the government's legal responsibility to protect human rights.
Not all of Brazil's incarcerated population suffers equally. The penal system is intrinsically elitist. The minority of detainees with a university diploma or public connections are often issued separate cells and better conditions. The poor are seldom afforded such treatment. One study found that more than 80 per cent of prisoners could not afford to hire a lawyer. Making matters worse, there are no public defenders in more than 70 per cent of all judicial jurisdictions. It's hardly surprising, then, that those killed in custody tend to be poorer Brazilians, a sobering finding of the United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions.
A rash of federal and state investigations has confirmed that the penal system is disastrously overcrowded, stacked against the poor and rife with police brutality. So why do the deplorable conditions persist? One reason may be that Brazilian society tolerates the status quo. Criminals, so the argument goes, are simply unworthy of public concern. Opinion polls confirm that many Brazilians support tough penalties, prefer punishment over rehabilitation and accept that police abuses may occur. And Brazil's politicians lack not the material resources but the political and moral resolve to do the right thing.
Turning around Brazil's backward penal system will require a dramatic shift in public attitudes. If popular pressure is applied on politicians, entrenched resistance can be overcome. But real change requires political leadership. President Dilma Rousseff, who was imprisoned and tortured during the dictatorship era, pledged to improve prison conditions. Sadly, she has yet to move the agenda forward.
If she does, reforms should focus on reducing overcrowding and improving conditions. At the federal level, much-needed changes in drug legislation could drastically reduce the nonviolent-offender caseload. States should be encouraged to adopt alternatives to pretrial detention and invest in non-custodial sentencing and rehabilitation programs.
Even Justice Minister Jose Eduardo Cardozo recently said he'd rather die than be condemned to a Brazilian prison.
The justice system need not be reinvented. What is required is the implementation of key provisions of the constitution, not least the safeguarding of basic rights that all Brazilians are entitled to.

Even Justice Minister Jose Eduardo Cardozo recently said he'd rather die than be condemned to a Brazilian prison.
The justice system need not be reinvented. What is required is the implementation of key provisions of the constitution, not least the safeguarding of basic rights that all Brazilians are entitled to.

This is it. As of Monday we are officially live-aboards. To me that means that, starting on Monday, I will come home to the boat, sleep on the boat and wake up on the boat every day for the foreseeable future. This is deeply comforting to me. To Vick it means a week (only a week) of final push to sell everything that we own that doesn’t fit this new life, or doesn’t fit in the boat/manvan/storage unit. Monday is not deeply comforting to Vick.
This morning Vick made the brilliant and unexpected decision to call our good friend Katherine in for some professional organizing help. Katherine arrived late in the afternoon and the two of them lit into the piles of stuff that we’ve accumulated over the years and reduced it to a tidy stack of boxes and neatly organized piles. They made it through two rooms. Tomorrow Vick will be flying solo, but she’s already significantly more optimistic.
Ruby seems genuinely overjoyed with the prospect of moving onto a sailboat. I think she’s even given it significant and rational consideration. She knows that she’ll have next to no toys for example, but seems to think that

It was a meltdown of epic proportions.
And I’m not talking about my sweet Baby J turned temperamental toddler who I am thinking already has raging hormones.
Nor am I talking about my six year old son who has an impeccable flair for the dramatic.
No, this time it was mama.
It was my own fault, really.
I mean as they say – too much of a good thing is bad? (or however the hell that saying goes).
Anyway. Yes. Kids have their limits.
So I decided to cram in one more social event in an already overly scheduled day. I dragged my completely worn out kids out to dinner with friends and their completely worn out kids.
Seriously? Did I REALLY think this could possibly end well?
Again, my naivety never ceases to astound me.
The day started off great – my friend Nan and I took Baby J and our two youngest boys to Nonni’s for a tour of their factory to learn how they make their to-die-for biscotti (thanks T-Town Moms!).
The magic is done all right here in Tulsa, Oklahoma, people. Think Willy Wonka minus the creepy voice and the Oompa Loompas.
After 2 hours of learning how to make the heavenly twice-baked goodness (and chasing Baby J around the factory, trying to keep her hairnet on and keeping Nicholas out of the massive vat of chocolate) – most people would have called it a day.
But we were just getting started.
Lunch at Nan’s house.
Two hours at the pool in the 100 plus degree weather.
Another playdate at our house…four kids playing Survival Man while Baby J tried to sleep. You can imagine that scenario.
And of course I didn’t stop there. Because I’m an idiot.
Fast forward to our Super Fun Relaxing Dinner with Friends and All Their Kids. An Oxymoron at its best.
Nicholas cried the entire way to Elote (my favorite restaurant – in downtown Tulsa) because his friends left. Josie just cried.
Six tired kids. One unhappy baby. Four frazzled parents. You do the math.
I’m pretty sure our photo is posted to the hostess stand with the note: “Do Not Seat

More parking bays for Gautrain usersComment on this story

Several feasibility studies are also on the cards, the findings of which will guide plans to increase capacity of Africa’s first rapid rail system.
Barbara Jensen, spokeswoman for the Gautrain Management Agency, said necessary studies such as the environmental and transport impact assessments would be undertaken in due course at the three locations.
The Gautrain system includes about 10 000 parking bays spread across all stations.

the chicken separately with the oven on convect. The chicken turned out beautifully and the potatoes turned orange because of the molasses. But it all worked out. It was delicious. Or at least no one complained.
The recipe is here and basically it’s very easy. I used all chicken thighs, Yotam likes the leg and thigh, and since pomegranate molasses is very sour I added a couple of TBs of my sister’s honey.

e, tenure-track member of the faculty.
The number of employees in central system offices has increased six-fold since 1987, and the number of administrators in them by a factor of more than 34.
I have demonstrated in my book The Nearly Free University and The Emerging Economy: The Revolution in Higher Education that the tuition for a four-year bachelor's degree could (and should) cost $5,000, not $100,000 or $200,000.
The technology and tools already exist to accredit the student, not the institution and provide distributed courses, adaptive learning and real-world, workplace-based workshops for a tiny fraction of the ineffective, unaffordable system of higher education we are currently burdened with.
Once costs decline 95%, there is no need for student loans or the bloated bureaucracies currently overseeing the parasitic student-loan system.
Once we accredit the student, not the institution, existing universities will compete directly with Nearly Free Universities not in issuing diplomas but in how much students actually learned and mastered. If students can learn as much or more for $5,000 (including workshops in real-world workplaces) than they do for $160,000 in conventional universities, then the sectors of higher education that charge $160,000 for a 4-year degree will vanish.
In essence, technology has leapfrogged the existing higher education Status Quo, just as it has leapfrogged the banking sector.
Gordon T. Long and I discuss these issues in this 25-minute program:
Here is a taste of what we discuss:
THE LEGACY SYSTEM IS OBSOLETE
- Media and knowledge are no longer scarce—both are essentially free
- Students no longer need to be congregated in classrooms to hear oral lectures; the lectures can be distributed at almost no cost via the Internet
- The factory model of teaching the same texts and curriculum no longer makes sense; every digital device is a library and a display for oral lectures
- Lessons and methodologies of learning can now be tailored to individual students (adaptive learning) via interactive software
- The need for live oral lectures as the primary (and presumed to be best) mode of teaching has vanished
- Students learn mastery in workshops held in real-world workplaces, not classrooms
THE FUNDAMENTALS HAVE BROKEN
- Colleges must separate Research and Educational funding
- Education versus Occupational Training
- Internships versus Apprenticeships; why corporations are no longer training
- "Time is the New Competitive Dimension;" the educational systems needs to understand what this means
- The New Economy requires Soft Skills such as Collaboration, Lifetime Learning, Continual Innovation and the full spectrum of Entrepreneurial Skill

What preparations are Allen and Scott making for the upcoming cattle sale next week
------------correct----------------------
- Van Wert
Diary of Cathy Minges - Week 4 - December 20-26
Monday, December 20, 2010
Allen did his barn chores before he left for work. Another cold day with a lot of snow on the ground that is not going anywhere anytime soon! I worked at the FB office. Short week for me with the holidays. Allen will finish the week on Thursday. After work Allen worked on the livestock trailer. The back doors seem a little loose and he is tightening up the bolts. Not a very easy task as the bolts are behind a welded piece with no easy access to them. I went to Harrison after work to pick up a few last minute supplies. Allen put out round bales of hay and then went to get some straw they will need for the sale next week. Wyatt is having a semi trailer haul his cattle in, we may meet the trailer north of Eaton on I-70 to put our 4 head on for the trip to Zanesville. Scott will pull a gooseneck trailer with the big supplies they will need such as: chutes, generators, blowers, space heaters, straw and hay. Allen will pull our livestock trailer with other supplies they will need. We join together with Carrie and Wyatt on supplies since we all help each other. Allen did his evening feeding and checked bedding and water. Allen and Scott will start clipping later in the week for transport on next Tuesday. It takes a good 3-4 hours or more to clip on each head, plus the calf has to be washed and blown dry thoroughly before you can clip. Clipping takes a lot of practice and patience and can be very meticulous. Allen does a little prep clipping, but Scott does the majority. A good clip job will enhance the calf and is necessity with show cattle. Wyatt was going to start his sale clipping on Sunday with all the cattle he has in the sale. Not sure if he got started, he had people looking at steers on Sunday and sold a few head. Carrie helps Wyatt clip when she can. A few years ago for her birthday he gave he a hot pink toolbox and painted all her tools and clippers hot pink for her. That is one of her favorite colors. With all of Scott's work and Allen's work week, they will probably spend a majority of the weekend clipping, along with Monday to be ready to send the cattle on Tuesday.

More snow this morning, maybe another 2-3 inches. Allen up and fed cattle and did chores before he left for work at 6:00. I worked at the FB office. Our office is closed on Wednesday so this is the last day this week for me for the Christmas holiday! After work, Allen put out round bales for the cows, fed the calves and finished his other chores before we went Christmas shopping. He said he would finish up early so we could get a good start. Early to him was around 6:30. Grabbed a bit to eat on the way and did our one stop shopping at JC Penney. After 1 1/2 hrs we were finished and Allen hopes he doesn't see another store besides Tractor Supply for at least another year. Allen and Scott already talking about the next calf crop. Depending on how the bred heifer we have in the sale will sell, we may flush the cow for eggs. They plan ahead on how they will A/I breed a cow to what bull based on the genetics of the cow and bull. They are many things you look for and if a calf turns out really well, other advanced reproductive techniques such as flushing for more eggs to try to get the same quality calves for embryo transfers with recip cows. This can be a costly venture and we only consider this option with cows that are super-producers. Breeders will purchase their bull semen from catalogs with the genetics of the bull along with other EPD's (Expected Progeny Differences) such as: birth weight, weaning weight, yearly weight, milking ability, calving ease and other data used to make the calculations. You have to be careful breeding a heifer or small cow to bulls that produce large calves. This can cause real problems at birth in which you can loose the calf and possibly the cow or heifer.

Allen fed and did his other chores before leaving for work. This is his last full work day at his job before the holiday. He was at the Zoo again today and will return there on Jan. 3. His company is closed down for the week between Christmas and New Year. This will work out well for him with the upcoming cattle sale next week. I met Sheri to pick-up Cole for the day. I took Cole down to Ross for a haircut and we had to go to the bank. Afterwards we worked on painting ornaments that he is giving to family for the holidays. I did the usual Wednesday chores, cleaned, laundry and put our fresh Christmas greens for decorations in the house. Love the evergreen smell. After lunch we went over to visit my parents, something he loves to do and looks forward to each week. After Allen returned home from work a little later than usual, he did his feeding and other chores for the evening. Allen met Sheri to drop-off Cole and also load our semen tank in her vehicle for Scott. Sheri is finished with this semester of school so she is off work on Wednesdays a little earlier now. It weighs about 40 pounds and currently has about 100 straws of semen in the tank. The tank is filled with nitrogen gas to keep the semen froze for proper storage. A straw of semen can cost between $20 and $100, or much more, depending on the quality of the bulls. We insure the semen tank as a separate rider on our insurance policy, when it is full, you can have a lot of money at stake. I made pancakes and sausage for supper, hit the spot. Nice to be home for the evening. The cattle are all doing very well and tolerating the bitter cold weather, much better than we are.

Allen was able to sleep in a little today and got up at 6:00 to feed and do other barn chores. They have a short day at work today. He and other co-workers met down at the little restaurant in Okeana for their annual breakfast get-together before they go into work. They have a short company meeting then a catered meal before their holiday break. Allen returned home around 12:30 to head out to the barn. He put more round bales out and had to put out some more corn stalk bales for bedding. Keeping dry bedding for the cattle is always a priority. I was off today and star
------------expect----------------------
ted cleaning the house from top to bottom for Christmas Eve. Went to the grocery store early to get items for the holiday weekend. I seem to be very slow this year with my fall cleaning so have been trying to catch up the past month washing curtains, windows and scrubbing down walls and floors. Seems to be more work than usual with my hip problem. Allen worked in the barn cleaning and repairing supplies they will need for the sale next week. Allen washed the cows that will be in the sale next week. After they are washed, he uses a blower that is like a giant hair dryer and blows the cows dry. The cows hair must be clean for clipping. The sale cattle and calves are kept in pens in the show barn where the manure is cleaned each morning and evening. This helps keep the cattle clean. The vet was coming today around 4:00 to check over the sale cattle and leave the health papers needed for the sale. After the vet left, Allen put out more round bales and finished feeding the cows. Checked the waterers and tanks and picked pens in the show barn. This cold weather means busting ice in mornings and evenings in the water tanks, thank goodness we only have a few that we use now since we put in the automatic waterer. Allen in the house by 6:30, steak for dinner. Carrie called later in evening. They have been clipping on their sale cattle and have had buyers out at farm for steer calves. Something broke on their large tractor loader that they use to put out round bales, she said it was $6000 to fix it. Costly equipment repairs can really hurt!

Another cold morning. Allen up early to get his chores done before Scott comes out to clip. Allen had the cows ready for clipping when Scott arrived around 10:00. They stopped for a quick bite of lunch and clipped until about 3:00. The 2 cows are clipped and ready to go for the sale. Allen and Scott are very pleased with how they look and hopeful they sell well in the sale. My sister and family, along with Scott, Sheri and Cole are coming over for Christmas Eve. We have been following the weather all day since they were calling for snow. My sister is traveling from near Hillsboro and worried about the drive home. I cleaned and made cookies. Made all the other goodies we were having for the evening. Allen finished his chores for the day and in the house around 4:30. Had a very nice evening with family and enjoyed opening gifts and just visiting. We all enjoyed watching Cole open gifts and the expression on his face. We bought him a new coat for Christmas that has Minges Show Cattle on the back and his name on the front. He had to wear it for a while then finally decided he was getting hot and took it off. We have been showing and selling cattle as Minges Show Cattle since 1989 and our kids always enjoyed having coats with our name on it. Good advertising! We played games and everyone went home around 10:30. Roads were in good shape and we only had a dusting of snow.

Merry Christmas! Allen up early to feed. Even on holidays, the livestock is fed just like any other day and chores have to be done. Allen worked in barn for a while getting more supplies ready that will be loaded into our livestock trailer. I baked a pie that I was taking over to my parents for lunch with family. Allen finished his chores we left for my parents around noon. Like always at my parents, too much food and too many gifts! Allen left their house around 4:00 to go home and do his evening chores before we headed up to his sister's house for the Minges Christmas get-together. Carrie was not able to make it home for Christmas but we talked with her before we left for the day. They will be spending Christmas Day at the Baker family and also spending part of the day clipping cattle. Scott, Sheri and Cole came to my parents late in the afternoon after spending the day with her family. Cole fell asleep on the trip there, worn out from all the presents and excitment. They went to the Minges side and we all went home around 10:00.
Sunday, December 26, 2010
Allen up early to do the feeding and put out round bales. He washed the bred heifer that will sell in the sale and blew her dry so that Scott could clip her later that morning. Bitter cold today and the wind is really whipping around. Snow blowing over the roads. Scott and Allen clipped until around 3:00. They decided to wait until Monday to clip the open heifer. After clipping, they started loading supplies on our livestock trailer. Our dog Chloe, an Australian Shepherd, is Allen's shadow when he is out doing the chores. She likes to know what is going on. We originally bought her for Scott to go with his working border collie dog Jake. She was only out at Scott's for a few months, she liked to chase birds more than anything and was a distraction for his dog. Scott's cattle dog is really something to watch. He is his right-hand man and we credit him with saving Scott from serious injury a few years ago. Scott was loading several large bulls on a trailer when one of the bulls kicked back full force as he was trying to latch the door, hitting Scott in the forehead and knocking him out. His dog kept the bulls from stepping back off the trailer onto Scott until someone could get there to get him out of the way. Scott was okay, he just had stitches all the way across his forehead. You always have to be careful around cattle, especially bulls and cows with calves. We have raised a few bulls, but generally castrate our bull calves and sell them for steers. We just don't have the facilities to accommodate bulls and I don't like them around. Allen finished his evening chores and in the house early. We had to go to Harrison and get new bulbs for the lights they will use at the sale and decided to eat while we were down there. Carrie called in the evening to say they were just returning from picking up heifers on the eastern side of Indy. They will be clipping non-stop until Tuesday morning to have all the cattle ready. Glad the weather forecast shows warmer weather on Thursday. They will have to wash, blow-dry and fit 20 head of cattle before the 1:00 PM sale, which means they will probably start around 3:00 AM or earlier
