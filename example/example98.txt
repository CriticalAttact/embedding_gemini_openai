Why has Jets head coach Rex Ryan decided to start Greg McElroy instead of Tim Tebow
------------correct----------------------
r the game, came the news that Sanchez is benched -- because apparently Jets head coach Rex Ryan believes in the "better late than never" approach. Ryan now provides the "WTF" moment of the season, announcing Tuesday he plans to start Greg McElroy -- the third string QB -- instead of Tim Tebow.
This bizarre decision will surely prompt conspiracy theorists to wonder if there is some behind the scenes payoff being offered to keep Tebow off the field. Because, really? McElroy? Really.
ESPN reports Ryan has no good explanation for the mysterious move, telling reporters, "I can answer this question a million ways -- frontward, backward, sideways, anything else. It's my decision and I based it on a gut feeling or whatever."

sive.
But I do think that privilege is best understood as a two-tiered system. There are some people, and some types of privilege,for which you got benefits you didn’t have to earn and in a perfect world wouldn’t have– think about the thankfully-no-longer-existent right of men to have sex with their wives whenever they liked, without the wives having to consent. That kind of privilege deserves to disappear and should be given up or used for the benefit of greater equality, as much as is possible, by those who have it.
And there are the types of privilege for which you just don’t have to put up with the shit other people do or have the basic human rights that they don’t. The right to not get pulled over for driving while black. The right to get married to the person you love. The right to choose what will happen to your own body. That kind of privilege doesn’t need to be given up, obviously. It needs to be extended to everyone.
I wonder if people would be more willing to accept the concept of privilege if it were presented less as “you have advantages other people don’t” and more as “other people have disadvantages you have escaped.

What are the areas where equestrian riders are most susceptible to muscle strain, according to performance coach Steve Morris
------------correct----------------------
Do riders really need to do stretches before they mount up? In a recent interview with Horse Network, performance coach, Steve Morris, of Morris Coaching in Calgary, Alberta says that the body is put under strain when a person has some muscles that are too short and some that are too long. By riding for hours every day, the muscle distortion piles up, especially over the years. Which areas are susceptible for equestrians? Not surprising, the hamstrings, the hips, and the groin. Why is your back hurting? “90% of the time it’s because your hip flexors are too tight, particularly in combination with tight hamstrings,” reveals Morris. By targeting these areas with pre- and/or post-ride stretching, you can help prevent muscle tearing and support the joints.
For hamstrings, Steve suggests combining a moving stretch with a stationary stretch. Hips respond well to a forward lunge position with your back knee on the ground.“You’re looking to get deep into a forward stretch across the front of the hip. You’re pushing your hip forward and down as deeply as possible, really thinking about the front of the hip being long and elastic,” he coaches. The more elasticity you can create in the groin, the less likely it is to tear. You’ll even find you have more strength. A muscle that has a good range of motion and elasticity is a stronger muscle,”
The groin is one of the most important stretches for riders as these muscles tend to get short and tight from holding onto the horse. Steve teaches a start with one leg out to the side in a deep static stretch to encourage the groin m

What negative effects are attributed to overexposure to electromagnetic radiation, particularly among children, as discussed in the text

and are attributed to the Earth’s spherical form. (14)
It is also understood by most Tesla researchers that Schumann in fact only
Rediscovered this resonance; some of Nikola Tesla's experiments indicate
that not only was he aware of it, he actually employed it, harnessing it for
his own use during high power wireless experiments.
The lightning energies produced at the Colorado
laboratory are just one indication of this.
Because this resonance has been constantly altered by the many atmospheric
experiments involving nuclear explosions etc., there is no doubt that it has
effected all life on the planet below, and also no doubt that this was
observed by the experimenters, at least over periods of time, through
statistics of disease, mental illness, increased crime, crop failures,
drought, etc. etc.. (15)
Today we have to come to grips with the fact
that overexposure to Electromagnetic Radiation causes a great number of the
ills within our society, especially among children.
One example just coming to light: many science
groups have issued stark warnings against children using cell phones, and in
certain places in Asia cell towers are restricted from being anywhere near
schools. Microwave overexposure has been indicated in the ever increasing
cases of autism among children and bipolar disorder has almost exactly the
same symptoms as over exposure to EM energy as well.
Scalar electromagnetic processes, which utilize interfering
energy zones and fields on vast scales, are becoming a well known cause of
gastric disorders, fractured thought, untreatable biological disruption at
the molecular level, and much more. It should be noted and Highlighted that
the Russians began a lot of these experimentations before America did.
The early wireless broadcasting experiments like Argus, and the twenty or
thirty other unclassified tests during the 50's 60's and 70's (11),
literally caused the government to speed up its efforts to act even more
irresponsibly, for some reason. Perhaps the government agencies became
enthused with the mind control aspects of these experiments, the virtual
stunning of the life below with invisible but gigantic energies, and/or the
manipulation of a resonant frequency humans had evolved to over many
Disrupted quickly as it has been, in the last
two decades especially, its a wonder anyone can still think, let alone act,
for the betterment of the overall situation here.
These foolish experimenters in our government may just be a bunch of
diabolical ghouls, or they may just be stupid as hell. Or both. One way or
another, the early experiments in broadcasting electromagnetic energy seemed
only to whet the appetites of these maniacs, and we are now in the fifth or
sixth generation of this planetary alteration program.
It continues at an ever increasing pace.
There is much more concerning the military’s interest in broadcast
technology for environmental modification, communication, and silent
invisible weaponry in the following chapters.
The above is mentioned to illustrate the fact
that even though there appears to be an hiatus between Nikola Tesla's work,
and later experiments beginning in the 1950’s, broadcast technology was not
forgotten, and just became larger in scope and use, though hidden as top
secret technologies of control.
This natural progression of Nikola Tesla's work was in fact the development
of much more powerful antennae, even unconventional antennae: the
perpetuation of Tesla's work in the conventional arena have taken place as
what are known as phased arrays, where many antennae are used in concert,
for various purposes, not least of which is called Ionospheric Heating.
Later, antennae technologies went really macro
once plasma sciences were employed, so that broadcast and satellite enabled
active-auroras could augment the more conventional antennae systems via
reflection, redirection, and amplification of signals.
All that comes later though. For now we are still studying the earliest
types of broadcast technologies, and that is rather limited to the type of
antenna most people are familiar with, meaning the dishes or myriad other
configurations mounted on poles or towers. The type of antennae that are
fairly permanent, and rigid in the their physical aspects.
Many are receivers (Monopoles), some are used to

These latter day conventional antennae types are
known mostly for their ability to act together, many parts as one single
entity, in what is known as a phased array. These arrays are sometimes found
in close proximity to one another; that configuration is known as an
Antennae Farm. That means many antennae in a small area, perhaps even in the
These antennae in phased array will be computer
controlled and synchronized to create certain conditions within the
environment. Many researchers now believe, by simple virtue of prudence and
past actions, that a large number of the antennae strewn throughout all the
cities of the world are actually phased array, on a very large scale.
Computer control of these emitters is very easy to achieve, and the
operators would actually be remiss if they had not accomplished this, if for
no other reason than to create backup systems in case of failures of one or

very popular as law enforcement devices, are directed with broadcast energy
They too are a very large part of the overall
surveillance/behavior modification system.
GWEN Loves HAARP
To some people, the HAARP antennae
technology is a logical extension of another, earlier antennae network
devised and deployed by the U.S. Government during the 1980's, known as the
GWEN stands for Ground Wave Emergency Network,
and it consists of a system of towers with extensive radiate forms copper
wire, each wire 100 feet long, extending outward from the base of each tower
below the ground.
These GWEN towers are spaced 200 miles apart
across the northern areas of America. These are part of a plan called
Continuance of Government, a program to keep government in place in the
event of a nuclear attack or natural disaster. Like the HAARP project there
is more here than meets the eye, though. One of the main bloopers in the
explanation given by the government concerning GWEN is that the towers would
surely be destroyed in any protracted nuclear conflict.
This was noted by the director of the program
itself. GWEN towers are also subject to damage by Electromagnetic pulse;
those two factors illustrate graphically that the Government Continuance
scenario of GWEN lacks plausibility in the extreme. (16)
Many researchers have stated openly that GWEN serves one purpose and one
purpose only, which is the entrainment of a subject populations thought
processes. Some very heavy hitters in the electro-medical field, such as
Robert O. Becker M.D., Author of The Body Electric, made the statement
"GWEN is a superb system, in combination
with Cyclotron Resonance (HAARP) for producing behavioral alterations in
the civilian population."
More than a few researchers think that Gwen and
HAARP are closely related, in that they are just two parts of one program.
This remains to be seen, but many details and
known information does point to just that. The real goal of the combined
programs seems to be a single nefarious weapon used clandestinely against
the entire population of the United States, and even the world.
The first unclassified HAARP installation took place in the wilds of Alaska,
very near the same place Tesla had formulated as being best for pumping the
world full of usable energy in a wireless grid.
Operated by various corporate entities like
Phillips Laboratory and Atlantic Richfield Corporations subsidiaries for the
United States Air Force and Navy, the program has always been labeled

very popular as law enforcement devices, are directed with broadcast energy
They too are a very large part of the overall
surveillance/behavior modification system.
GWEN Loves HAARP
To some people, the HAARP antennae
technology is a logical extension of another, earlier antennae network
devised and deployed by the U.S. Government during the 1980's, known as the
GWEN stands for Ground Wave Emergency Network,
and it consists of a system of towers with extensive radiate forms copper
wire, each wire 100 feet long, extending outward from the base of each tower
below the ground.
These GWEN towers are spaced 200 miles apart
across the northern areas of America. These are part of a plan called
Continuance of Government, a program to keep government in place in the
event of a nuclear attack or natural disaster. Like the HAARP project there
is more here than meets the eye, though. One of the main bloopers in the
explanation given by the government concerning GWEN is that the towers would
surely be destroyed in any protracted nuclear conflict.
This was noted by the director of the program
itself. GWEN towers are also subject to damage by Electromagnetic pulse;
those two factors illustrate graphically that the Government Continuance
scenario of GWEN lacks plausibility in the extreme. (16)
Many researchers have stated openly that GWEN serves one purpose and one
purpose only, which is the entrainment of a subject populations thought
processes. Some very heavy hitters in the electro-medical field, such as
Robert O. Becker M.D., Author of The Body Electric, made the statement
"GWEN is a superb system, in combination
with Cyclotron Resonance (HAARP) for producing behavioral alterations in
the civilian population."
More than a few researchers think that Gwen and
HAARP are closely related, in that they are just two parts of one program.
This remains to be seen, but many details and
known information does point to just that. The real goal of the combined
programs seems to be a single nefarious weapon used clandestinely against
the entire population of the United States, and even the world.
The first unclassified HAARP installation took place in the wilds of Alaska,
very near the same place Tesla had formulated as being best for pumping the
world full of usable energy in a wireless grid.
Operated by various corporate entities like
Phillips Laboratory and Atlantic Richfield Corporations subsidiaries for the
United States Air Force and Navy, the program has always been labeled
experimental, in spite of overt statemen

he palace of grand. There whisper each other my white nightly skies Of somebodys love, very secret and high. And all shines with jasper and pearl in the night… But nobody knows a source of the light.
Edward Lear 12 or 13 May January 1888 He was an English artist, illustrator, musician, author and poet, and is known now mostly for his literary nonsense in poetry and prose and especially his limericks, a form he popularized. As an author, he is known principally for his popular nonsense collections of poems, songs, short stories, botanical drawings, recipes, and alphabets.
There was a Young Lady whose chin, Resembled the point of a pin; So she had it made sharp, And purchased a harp, And played several tunes with her chin. *** There was an Old Man in a boat, Who said, 'I'm afloat, I'm afloat!' When they said, 'No! you ain't!' He was ready to faint, That unhappy Old Man in a boat. There was an Old Man of Moldavia, Who had the most curious behavior; For while he was able, He slept on a table. That funny Old Man of Moldavia. *** There was an Old Man of Peru, Who never knew what he should do; So he tore off his hair, And behaved like a bear, That intrinsic Old Man of Peru.
Thomas More 7 February 1478 – 6 July 1535 He was an English lawyer, social philosopher, author, statesman and noted Renaissance humanist. He was also a councilor to Henry VIII and Lord Chancellor from October 1529 to 16 May 1532.
Those evening bells! How many a tale their music tells, Of youth, and home, and those sweet time, When last I heard their soothing chime. Those joyous hours are passed away; And many a heart, that then was gay, Within the tomb now darkly dwells, And hears no more those evening bells. And sot will be when I am gone; That tuneful peal will still ring on, While other bards shall walk these dells, And sing your praise, sweet evening bells.
John Keats 31 October 1795 – 23 February 1821 He was an English Romantic poet. He was one of the main figures of the second generation of Romantic poets along with Lord Byron, despite his work having been in publication for only four years before his death. Although his poems were not generally well received by critics during his life, his reputation grew after his death, so that by the end of the 19th century, he had become one of the most beloved of all English poets.
THE GRASSHOPPER AND CRICKET The poetry of earth is never dead: When all the birds are faint with the hot sun, And hide in cooling trees, a voice will run From hedge to hedge about the new- mown mead; That is the Grasshopper's – he takes the lead In summer luxury, - he has never done With his delights; for when tired out with fun He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed. The poetry of earth is ceasing never: On a lone winter evening, when the frost Has wrought a silence, from the stove there shrills The Cricket's song, in warmth increasing ever, And seems to one in drowsiness half lost, The Grasshopper's among some grassy hills.
Alexander Blok 28 November 1880 – 7 August 1921 He the greatest of the Russian Symbolists, progressed from the ethereal purity of Verses about the Beautiful Lady (1904) to the powerful expressiveness of his mature manner, fully developed by His last masterpiece is The Twelve, a long poem which expresses his short-lived enthusiasm for the Revolution.
I see the long forgotten blaze, And I can clearly hear, in silence, Another song behind the violins, The chesty voice that filled the space. Thats how she answered all my pledges, My love and passion, first and last, I recognize it when the blast Of wind and blizzard wails and rages. The past has gone without a trace, And only some ones aspiration Reminds me somehow, with good grace, Of happiness and exultation.

I was familiar with the remake of "I Am The Black Gold of the Sun", I enjoyed most of rest of the cd as well, the fusion of the different styles - jazz, dance, Latin, it is always good to hear music that doesn't recognize barriers, but of course, there is little place on radio for such music.

".... I hope to hear this album on a weekly basis. I bought the NuYoricanSoul album when it first came out and still,whenever I go into a bar, a restaurant or a club and hear the soulful tones of India and Jocelyn Brown, accompanied by Roy Ayers, George Benson and Tito Puente, Mastered by MAW (Lil' Louie Vega - The Bucketheads - and Kenny Dope Gonzalez).... I die and go to heaven. This is the music that you would want to accompany your laid-back, funky, sunny, HAPPY lifestyle. Since this album blew up, nobody has been able to match it.Everyone who has this agrees that it is one of the best albums to come out of the 90's, and it's relatively undiscovered by the vultures, so it hasn't dated in trend or reputation.

Sausage and bubblegum? One might think the duo would be about as successful as that classic combo of Nuts and Gum--that is to say, not at all, and an all-around terrible idea--but Katja Pettersson managed to make a perfect paring, shown as part of the Glass Elephant exhibition during Stockholm’s recent design week.
The directive for the show was to use glass as muse while exploring the unique outcomes that can occur when contrasts come together. Pettersson--one of the founding members of Swedish design group Front, who now lectures, works independently, and heads up the Fifty Fifty Projects--wanted to tackle a kind of synesthesia through design. In other words, can you sense a taste by seeing a form?
She began brainstorming by asking herself a series of questions that revolved around the materiality and basic qualities of each of her chosen component parts

ction, disk swapping, or modem. Specific cables for the PowerBook are included.
The MacVGA Video Adapter displays up to 256 colors on VGA and SVGA monitors when connected to a PowerBook 160/180, or MiniDocked Duo 210/230. Apple is quick to supply two lengthy lists, one of monitors that are known to work and the one those that definitely do not.
Ever try to print to what we in the Mac environment would call a non-standard printer? To address this, Apple includes PowerPrint from GDT Softworks. The literature claims PowerPrint prints text and graphics to any of more than a 1000 different printers, whether they be laser, ink-jet or dot-matrix. Rather than send us looking for cables, PowerPrint includes a serial-to-parallel cable.
[In our limited experience, PowerPrint worked wonderfully on an old Epson LX-80 and Hewlett-Packard DeskJet. It was amazing to see a screeching old LX-80 knock off decent-looking Macintosh output after five years of service. -Adam]

amazing is the fact that it's without genre - a fusion of soul, jazz, funk, Latin, Disco, Beats rhymes and life... It's a big part of mine, and if you like the sound of the above make it part of yours.(but no, the Armand Van Helden remix of Runaway isn't on it)"

"This album was quite a pleasant suprise for me. I knew very little, if nothing, about this group. I only heard "Runaway" on the radio, but I was so impressed by that song that I decided to get the album. I don't know about all you folks out there, but for me, whenever I buy an album for one good song, the rest of the album is never up to the same level as that ONE song. This album will prove the contrary. Virtually every song on the album is as good as the other. What I also love about this album is that it crosses so many different genres of music, while making it actually sound in harmony with one another! Far too often artists try to do this mixing and matching of different genres but the end results sounds so abstract and with no streamline flow to it, however Nuyorican Soul is a wonderful mix of Latin-House-R&B-Smooth Jazz-Ambient-Soul all in one! This album also has some great contributions by some classic artists, like George Benson and Roy Ayers. Be sure to check it out!!!"

Broadcast Technology -
A Short History
"At the dawn of the scientific-technical
progress, dictators and rulers of totalitarian governments dreamt about
how to embody the most ancient occult sciences and hidden potentials of
mankind's psyche in technical weapons in order to, with their help, make
their own populations obediently conformist, blindly fulfilling the
wishes of the dictator and his associates.
They even cherished monstrous ideas, after
the creation of super-weapons, of using these for the enslavement of
other governments and of becoming rulers of the world... Psychotronic
weapons are a complex of unique electronic-irradiating apparatuses
capable, over a large distance, of controlling the psycho-physical
activities of a person, purposefully destroying his health. Psychotronic
weapons are lofty, rational weapons which are applied in combination
with other types of non-lethal weapons and psycho-technological weapons.
Usually people who become victims are gifted
people not loyal to the regime, servicemen from military subdivisions,
athletes, those held in prisons and concentration camps, people who make
up the ranks of dispensaries, without exception prisoners of psychiatric
hospitals, and also the population in free behavior. With the
realization of the psycho-programming and terror, the criminals strictly
adhere to the basic principle of psycho-com-fascism which consists of
the gradual suppression and destruction of the person in a
psycho-physical plan, as with the personality and the destruction of his
In connection with this, the conclusion
suggests itself : that governmental departments, called upon to stand as
the guardian of the health of the people, appear to be direct
participants in these abominable crimes."
N.I. Anisimov, 1999, from:
“The technetronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more
controlled society. Such a society would be dominated by an elite,
unrestrained by traditional values.”
Zbigniew Brzezinski - Between Two
Though it is beyond the scope of this
book to delve too deeply into the life and genius of
Tesla, it would be impossible to address our subject matter
without covering at least the basics, because a lot of what has been
deployed since 911 are actually forms of Tesla technology which have been
willfully hidden for many years.
According to Tesla's FBI file (1),
upon his death the personal items belonging to him, including most of his
documentation, were impounded by the office of Alien Property, Department of
Justice. Many Freedom of information Act requests have been made to the FBI
concerning these personal goods of Nikola Tesla, especially concerning the
notes and books, and these requests, numbering in the hundreds or even
thousands - have come up empty.
There are some of Tesla's private communications
and publications among the public though, and most of these papers are
extremely collectible and valuable.
The United States Navy is mentioned several times within the heavily
redacted FBI records of Nikola Tesla, as well as among many other references
to Tesla's work, up to and including the modern HAARP program, which will be
covered in some depth later.
The overall conclusion most researchers have drawn is that Tesla’s work was
first buried, then developed clandestinely by secret groups within the
government of the United States. There is a lot of evidence for this
proposal; judging from other cases concerning government experimentation in
mind control and behavior modification, a reader/researcher may at least
begin to see that this is the way the United States government generally
operates, while spouting a creed of DENY DENY DENY, even when faced with
proof positive of their activities.
Because this is the same government which writes
the laws, they naturally exempt themselves from any kind of accountability
that way as well. A police state cannot occur without a secrecy regime
Fortunately for us, Nikola Tesla did a pretty good job of making most of his
work publicly known in books, magazines and patents before his death, in
spite of the fact that most people found his work incomprehensible while he
was alive. It is now possible to do a little reading, and get a decent
picture of what has happened, and what is just beginning to happen after all
these years again.
Tesla was born in Smiljan, Croatia in 1865, and he showed intellectual
restlessness, some say precociousness, at an early age. Tesla's father was a
clergyman, and had planned a life in the priesthood for his son, though
Nikola prevailed upon him for advanced schooling in what he loved: machinery
and electricity; eventually he was allowed to pursue an engineering degree
at the Technical University at Graz Austria, and the University of Prague.
In 1882 Tesla traveled to Paris France, where he
found work with the Continental Edison Company. It was there Tesla began
visualizing motors powered with alternating current (AC).
At that time direct current (DC) was all the
rage, being used by the world entire to power experiments and new
inventions, even though DC was dangerous and inefficient compared to
alternating current. Nobody wanted to hear about improvements from a young
super-unknown such as Nikola Tesla, so the young scientist did what any good
maverick would do: he split the scene for better opportunities elsewhere.
Tesla came to America in 1884, and for a short time he worked with Thomas
Edison himself, but the two did not see things eye to eye at all, and Tesla
quickly left the Edison Labs. He soon proved his superiority in certain
aspects of the electrical sciences though, and went on to develop patents in
his own name, which later became a large part of the Westinghouse
Corporation, and more.
Many of Tesla's patents went without development
in his later years, and Nikola Tesla died in 1943 with some of his later
inventions never being realized, except on paper. Some of the inventions by
Nikola Tesla that were developed are the polyphase induction (Electric)
motor, neon and fluorescent lights, the automobile ignition system, and 2 &
3 phase alternating current.
Nikola Tesla was also responsible for almost all wireless technologies.
Though Marconi is given credit for the radio, it was Tesla who actually
developed the science and patented it, along with other novel and powerful
wireless technologies. From The Journal of The International Tesla Society,
Power and Resonance, vol. 6, no. 4:
"Tesla's most important work at the end of
the nineteenth century was his original system of transmission of energy
by wireless antenna. In 1900 Tesla obtained two fundamental patents (#’s
645,576 and 649,6212) on the transmission of true wireless energy
covering both methods and apparatus and involving the use of four tuned
In 1943 (3 months after Tesla's death -
Ed.), the Supreme Court of the United States granted full patent rights
to Nikola Tesla for the invention of the radio, superseding and
nullifying any prior claim by Marconi and others in regards to the
"Fundamental Radio Patent"..."
A dream of Nikola Tesla was free wireless power
for the world.
This was the main reason behind the construction
of his various and well known (Wardenclyffe/Colorado Springs) antennae, but
it was also to be his ultimate undoing, because it discouraged his two main
financiers, George Westinghouse, of the Westinghouse Electric Company, and
J.P. Morgan; both were heavily vested in metered electricity-for-money
These same people then invited him to invent
military weapons technologies as a means to further financing, although this
went against the scientists basic ideals. Later he became so strapped for
money that he began thinking along these lines, but by then he had scared
the moguls of finance so badly they wanted nothing to do with him.
One of the Tesla inventions (Patent 1,119,732) designed to create wireless
power resulted in what he called his Magnifying Transmitter, which has since
come to be called the Tesla Magnifying Transmitter, or TMT.

Презентация на конкурс «Радуга презентаций – 2015» My favorite poet Автор: Анастасия Геннадиевна Моисеева, учитель английского языка МБОУ СОШ 7, г. Мичуринска
William Shakespeare 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616 His extant works, including some collaborations, consist of about 38 plays,154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, of which the authorship of some is uncertain. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.
Sonnet 130 My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun; Coral is far more red than her lips' red; If snow be white; why then her breasts are dun; If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head. I have seen roses damasked, red and white, But no such roses see I in her cheeks, And in some perfumes is there more delight Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks. I love to hear her speak, yet well I know That music hath a far more pleasing sound; I grant I never saw a goddess go - My mistress when she walks treads on the ground. And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare As any she belied with false compare.
Sergei Yesenin 3 October 1895 – 28 December 1925 He was one of Russia's most popular poets, most of his writings were banned by the Kremlin. Only in 1966 were most of his works republished. Today Yesenin's poems are taught to Russian schoolchildren; many have been set to music and recorded as popular songs. His early death, coupled with unsympathetic views by some of the literary elite, adoration by ordinary people, and sensational behavior, all contributed to the enduring and near mythical popular image of the Russian poet.
Silver road, I wonder where You are calling me anew? Like a Thursday candle there Shines a starlet over you. Are you fraught with joy or sorrow? Isnt madness your intent? Help me, heart and soul, tomorrow Love your hard snow to the end. Give me sunset for the sleigh and Willow branch that beautifies. Maybe I will in the end Reach the gate of paradise.
George Gordon Byron 22 January 1788 – 19 April 1824 Lord Byron, was an English poet and a leading figure in the Romantic movement. Among Byron's best-known works are the lengthy narrative poems Don Juan and Childe Harold's Pilgrimage and the short lyric She Walks in Beauty.
She walks in Beauty, like the night Of cloudless climes and starry skies; And all that's best of dark and bright Meet in her aspect and her eyes: Thus mellowed to that tender light Which Heaven to gaudy day denies. One shade the more, one ray the less, Had half impaired the nameless grace Which waves in every raven tress, Or softly lightens o'er her face; Where thoughts serenely sweet express, How pure, how dear their dwelling-place. And on that cheek, and o'er that brow, So soft, so calm, yet eloquent, The smiles that win, the tints that glow, But tell of days in goodness spent, A mind at peace with all below, A heart whose love is innocent!
Anna Akhmatova 23 June 1889 – 5 March 1966 She was a Russian modernist poet, one of the most acclaimed writers in the Russian canon. Her talent in composition and translation is evidenced in her fine translations of the works of poets writing in French, English, Italian, Armenian, and Korean.
I crave for the roses and garden my best, Thats clad in the best in the word airy fence. Where statues remember me youthful and blessed, And I – them all covered by Nevas cold waves. In silence, so fragrant, amidst limes of kings, I hear: the ship's masts are squeaking in swings. And sails the white swain through the ages again, Enjoying the charm of his brother-of-twain. And deadly sleep hundreds of thousands steps Of friends and of foes, of foes and friends. And the train of shadows has no the end From vases granite to t

What recommendations did the NRC review board make regarding the safety systems of GE BWR Mark I units
------------correct----------------------
ltaneous loss of all off-site and on-site electrical power for safety systems.
The NRC review process will now consider the review board’s recommendation to “accept” in part Beyond Nuclear’s requested actions for additional investigation to include:
(1) “Immediately revoke prior pre-approval of the hardened vent system or direct torus vent system at each GE BWR Mark I unit under the provisions of 10 CFR 50.59,” and;
(2) “Immediately issue Confirmatory Action Orders to all GE BWR Mark I units to promptly install safety-related backup electrical power (Class E-1) and additional backup DC battery system to ensure reliable supply for the spent fuel pool cooling system.”
The review board further recommended that the agency “reject” in part Beyond Nuclear’s requested actions for any further review to include;
1) “Immediately suspend operating licenses of all GE BWR Mark I units pending full NRC review with independent expert and public participation from the affected emergency planning zone communities,” and;
2) “Conduct public meetings within each of the ten-mile emergency planning zone for each GE BWR site for the purpose of receiving public comment and independent expert testimony regarding the reliability of hardened vent system or direct torus vent system.”

ls,
and are attributed to the Earth’s spherical form. (14)
It is also understood by most Tesla researchers that Schumann in fact only
Rediscovered this resonance; some of Nikola Tesla's experiments indicate
that not only was he aware of it, he actually employed it, harnessing it for
his own use during high power wireless experiments.
The lightning energies produced at the Colorado
laboratory are just one indication of this.
Because this resonance has been constantly altered by the many atmospheric
experiments involving nuclear explosions etc., there is no doubt that it has
effected all life on the planet below, and also no doubt that this was
observed by the experimenters, at least over periods of time, through
statistics of disease, mental illness, increased crime, crop failures,
drought, etc. etc.. (15)
Today we have to come to grips with the fact
that overexposure to Electromagnetic Radiation causes a great number of the
ills within our society, especially among children.
One example just coming to light: many science
groups have issued stark warnings against children using cell phones, and in
certain places in Asia cell towers are restricted from being anywhere near
schools. Microwave overexposure has been indicated in the ever increasing
cases of autism among children and bipolar disorder has almost exactly the
same symptoms as over exposure to EM energy as well.
Scalar electromagnetic processes, which utilize interfering
energy zones and fields on vast scales, are becoming a well known cause of
gastric disorders, fractured thought, untreatable biological disruption at
the molecular level, and much more. It should be noted and Highlighted that
the Russians began a lot of these experimentations before America did.
The early wireless broadcasting experiments like Argus, and the twenty or
thirty other unclassified tests during the 50's 60's and 70's (11),
literally caused the government to speed up its efforts to act even more
irresponsibly, for some reason. Perhaps the government agencies became
enthused with the mind control aspects of these experiments, the virtual
stunning of the life below with invisible but gigantic energies, and/or the
manipulation of a resonant frequency humans had evolved to over many
Disrupted quickly as it has been, in the last
two decades especially, its a wonder anyone can still think, let alone act,
for the betterment of the overall situation here.
These foolish experimenters in our government may just be a bunch of
diabolical ghouls, or they may just be stupid as hell. Or both. One way or
another, the early experiments in broadcasting electromagnetic energy seemed
only to whet the appetites of these maniacs, and we are now in the fifth or
sixth generation of this planetary alteration program.
It continues at an ever increasing pace.
There is much more concerning the military’s interest in broadcast
technology for environmental modification, communication, and silent
invisible weaponry in the following chapters.
The above is mentioned to illustrate the fact
that even though there appears to be an hiatus between Nikola Tesla's work,
and later experiments beginning in the 1950’s, broadcast technology was not
forgotten, and just became larger in scope and use, though hidden as top
secret technologies of control.
This natural progression of Nikola Tesla's work was in fact the development
of much more powerful antennae, even unconventional antennae: the
perpetuation of Tesla's work in the conventional arena have taken place as
what are known as phased arrays, where many antennae are used in concert,
for various purposes, not least of which is called Ionospheric Heating.
Later, antennae technologies went really macro
once plasma sciences were employed, so that broadcast and satellite enabled
active-auroras could augment the more conventional antennae systems via
reflection, redirection, and amplification of signals.
All that comes later though. For now we are still studying the earliest
types of broadcast technologies, and that is rather limited to the type of
antenna most people are familiar with, meaning the dishes or myriad other
configurations mounted on poles or towers. The type of antennae that are
fairly permanent, and rigid in the their physical aspects.
Many are receivers (Monopoles), some are used to
both broadcast and receive (Dipole).
One of the latest incarnations of conventional
broadcast antennae systems is known as
which is an acronym for High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program.
These latter day conventional antennae types are
known mostly for their ability to act together, many parts as one single
entity, in what is known as a phased array. These arrays are sometimes found
in close proximity to one another; that configuration is known as an
Antennae Farm. That means many antennae in a small area, perhaps even in the
These antennae in phased array will be computer
controlled and synchronized to create certain conditions within the
environment. Many researchers now believe, by simple virtue of prudence and
past actions, that a large number of the antennae strewn throughout all the
cities of the world are actually phased array, on a very large scale.
Computer control of these emitters is very easy to achieve, and the
operators would actually be remiss if they had not accomplished this, if for
no other reason than to create backup systems in case of failures of one or
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, which are becoming
very popular as law enforcement devices, are directed with broadcast energy
They too are a very large part of the overall
surveillance/behavior modification system.
GWEN Loves HAARP
To some people, the HAARP antennae
technology is a logical extension of another, earlier antennae network
devised and deployed by the U.S. Government during the 1980's, known as the
GWEN stands for Ground Wave Emergency Network,
and it consists of a system of towers with extensive radiate forms copper
wire, each wire 100 feet long, extending outward from the base of each tower
below the ground.
These GWEN towers are spaced 200 miles apart
across the northern areas of America. These are part of a plan called
Continuance of Government, a program to keep government in place in the
event of a nuclear attack or natural disaster. Like the HAARP project there
is more here than meets the eye, though. One of the main bloopers in the
explanation given by the government concerning GWEN is that the towers would
surely be destroyed in any protracted nuclear conflict.
This was noted by the director of the program
itself. GWEN towers are also subject to damage by Electromagnetic pulse;
those two factors illustrate graphically that the Government Continuance
scenario of GWEN lacks plausibility in the extreme. (16)
Many researchers have stated openly that GWEN serves one purpose and one
purpose only, which is the entrainment of a subject populations thought
processes. Some very heavy hitters in the electro-medical field, such as
Robert O. Becker M.D., Author of The Body Electric, made the statement
"GWEN is a superb system, in combination
with Cyclotron Resonance (HAARP) for producing behavioral alterations in
the civilian population."
More than a few researchers think that Gwen and
HAARP are closely related, in that they are just two parts of one program.
This remains to be seen, but many details and
known information does point to just that. The real goal of the combined
programs seems to be a single nefarious weapon used clandestinely against
the entire population of the United States, and even the world.
The first unclassified HAARP installation took place in the wilds of Alaska,
very near the same place Tesla had formulated as being best for pumping the
world full of usable energy in a wireless grid.
Operated by various corporate entities like
Phillips Laboratory and Atlantic Richfield Corporations subsidiaries for the
United States Air Force and Navy, the program has always been labeled
experimental, in spite of overt statemen

ction, disk swapping, or modem. Specific cables for the PowerBook are included.
The MacVGA Video Adapter displays up to 256 colors on VGA and SVGA monitors when connected to a PowerBook 160/180, or MiniDocked Duo 210/230. Apple is quick to supply two lengthy lists, one of monitors that are known to work and the one those that definitely do not.
Ever try to print to what we in the Mac environment would call a non-standard printer? To address this, Apple includes PowerPrint from GDT Softworks. The literature claims PowerPrint prints text and graphics to any of more than a 1000 different printers, whether they be laser, ink-jet or dot-matrix. Rather than send us looking for cables, PowerPrint includes a serial-to-parallel cable.
[In our limited experience, PowerPrint worked wonderfully on an old Epson LX-80 and Hewlett-Packard DeskJet. It was amazing to see a screeching old LX-80 knock off decent-looking Macintosh output after five years of service. -Adam]
I live and work in a Mac-only environment. Occasionally, I need to work with foreign data formats. For this, Macintosh PC Exchange and the MacLink/Plus Translators have been useful. For Mac users in a primarily MS-DOS environment, I can easily see the need for all four utilities

Yesterday, popular gambling website Paddy Power found itself admitting that it had suffered a serious data breach - the kind of position that no company ever wants to find itself in.
Not that you would know if you visited their website, of course. Because there’s no mention of the issue on the front page that their customers visit. Instead they will need to find the link buried away in their press release section.
But when you dig into the details of this particular breach, and its public disclosure, you find things are actually a lot worse.
Firstly, this wasn’t a breach involving a small number of customers. Paddy Power believes that the personal details of almost 650,000 customers (649,055 if we’re being precise) were put at risk by hackers who broke into the company’s computer systems.
That’s a lot of gambling customers who have been exposed to more risk than perhaps they feel comfortable with.
Secondly, although financial information such as credit card details were not compromised (thank goodness) there was an awful lot of information which was - including customers’ names, usernames, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth and “prompted question and answer”.
Even though no passwords were grabbed by the hackers, there are still plenty of ways in which fraudsters and online criminals could exploit the information which has been exposed. For instance, it’s simple to imagine carefully crafted emails could be sent to customers (using the personal information taken from the stolen user database to make them appear more convincing) that could be designed to trick innocent victims into revealing more details about themselves, or clicking on dangerous links that could put their computers and their financial information at greater risk.
Thirdly, Paddy Power is at pains to point out that the incident has “no impact on customers who opened accounts after 2010”.
Now, you may think that’s good news - but dig a little deeper into the story and the truth tumbles out.
You see, Paddy Power first identified that it had been hacked back in 2010.
In its own words:
“Paddy Power had detected malicious activity in an attempted breach of its data security system in 2010. A detailed investigation was undertaken at the time and determined that no financial informa

How Beautiful the Ordinary , edited by Michael Cart, is a welcome addition to the small but growing collection of young adult fiction exploring gender identity and sexual orientation. Being a young person is difficult, what with all the changes physical, emotional, and social. Most of us spend our whole lives getting to know ourselves, and those initial explorations in our youth are some of the most confusing and painful (and exhilarating and profound) because they are so new. All of this can be overwhelming, and when you throw in societal condemnation of some of these identities and/or lifestyles it is especially hard. This collection of short fiction by well-respected young adult authors takes a loving and unrelenting look at the struggle not only to discover what we are as young women and men, but to accept and own that identity as well.
"My Virtual World" by Francesca Lia Block chronicles the ways in which online connections can serve to safely hide or reveal one's true self. Through a series of increasingly open instant messages, two young people struggling with depression find acceptance and in turn learn to accept themselves. Ariel Schrag and Eric Shanower contribute a humorous look at gay pride events and the pangs of a secret high school love, respectively, in graphic novel format. Poetic verse (Julie Anne Peters' intimate "The First Time") and screenplay (Ron Koertge's experimental story of a gay son's coming out to his father) also add variety to the collection.

------------question-----------------------
What actions did Paddy Power take in response to the data breach involving customer information
------------correct----------------------
tion or customer passwords had been put at risk. It was, however, suspected that some non-financial customer information may have been exposed and a full review of security systems was undertaken.”
The important thing to note is that Paddy Power did *not* at this point inform its 650,000 affected users. Instead they waited until this week - four years later - after a Canadian man was found in possession of the stolen data.
Paddy Power says it “takes its responsibilities regarding customer data extremely seriously” and is now warning customers “proactively”, as clearly there could be other websites where affected users could be using the same question and answer as security measures. (As with passwords, you shouldn’t reuse your trusted question/answer either).
“We take our responsibilities regarding customer data extremely seriously and have conducted an extensive investigation into the breach and the recovered data,” said Paddy Power’s online managing director, Peter O’Donovan. “That investigation shows that there is no evidence that any customer accounts have been adversely impacted by this breach. We are communicating with all of the people whose details have been compromised to tell them what has happened.”
What’s going on here is really damage limitation. It’s not so much about limiting the damage done by the data stolen by the hackers four years ago, but minimising the damage caused by Paddy Power’s sloppy handling of the incident.
It should have warned their users about the security breach back in 2010, and advised them to review passwords and security questions/answers as a precaution. At the same time Paddy Power could have warned users about the risks of bogus emails and fraud connected with the personal data (names, dates of birth, addresses) that might have fallen into the hands of cybercriminals.
And they should have informed the data protection commissioners four years ago too.
Waiting four years to tell your customers and the authorities that your company has suffered a security breach isn’t just sloppy, it seems downright irresponsible to me.
It should have shared the bad news much earlier, and not tried to hide it away four years later on a webpage that few of its customers will ever visit.

What is the reason for postponing the Nancy Drew Blog Hop until March
------------correct----------------------
Well, when one door closes another one opens they always say!
We were to start a Nancy Drew Blog Hop in January but the fabric is coming out way too late to give everyone time to make their creations so Madame Samm has put that hop off until March and in it's place has given us something fun to do instead!!
This blog hop has us including words on whatever we create, be it pieced, paper pieced, appliqued, stitched... or whatever medium we create in!! This is going to be a lot of fun and so exciting! I am going to be anxious to see what everyone creates for this hop!

She just seems like the kind of girl that I would want to be friends with…one who has her own sense of style, her own unique perspective.
By the way, the shoes were actually bought on the fly from a clearance rack at DSW! Again, SO the kind of girl that I want to be friends with!

As I scanned my newsfeed this morning, I had another one of those, “No duh, Bruce.” moments.
Yes, I am a Christian.
Yes, I am a citizen of the United States of America.
As a Christian – I believe that we must love and serve one another: the stranger, the enemy, the prisoner, the poor, the outcast, the hungry and the oppressed. And while often falling short, I strive to live this daily – even to the detriment of my own wealth, comfort and station.

Like I said, “No duh, Bruce.”
This is not a comfortable or simple tension to hold and it would be much much much easier to compartmentalize my world pretending as if the two are always in state of blissful alignment and never in direct conflict. But with our country’s ideologically discourse seemingly at a constant boil, as we debate

What are the speaker's beliefs regarding their obligations as a Christian and a U.S. citizen
------------correct----------------------
As I scanned my newsfeed this morning, I had another one of those, “No duh, Bruce.” moments.
Yes, I am a Christian.
Yes, I am a citizen of the United States of America.
As a Christian – I believe that we must love and serve one another: the stranger, the enemy, the prisoner, the poor, the outcast, the hungry and the oppressed. And while often falling short, I strive to live this daily – even to the detriment of my own wealth, comfort and station.
As a US Citizen – I believe that each of us has been “endowed by their creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness” – even if this belief gives people the right to make choices that are not always in their best interest.
Add this one in the “easy to say, hard to do” file.
Reading story after opinion after post, each tackling important questions around mental health, war, immigration, gun control, abortion, marriage equality or healthcare, I was again reminded that I must hold in tension the commitment to live my Christian faith with the responsibility of being a citizen of the United States of America.
Like I said, “No duh, Bruce.”
This is not a comfortable or simple tension to hold and it would be much much much easier to compartmentalize my world pretending as if the two are always in state of blissful alignment and never in direct conflict. But with our country’s ideologically discourse seemingly at a constant boil, as we debate

I think there’s an aspect of privilege that a lot of people haven’t really paid attention to: there are at least two kinds of it.
I see some people in the social justice community saying things like, “cis people benefit from transphobia.” But the thing is, they really, really don’t. Everything cis people have that trans people don’t– from the low chance of being murdered to the ability to have people respect their pronouns– is something that cis people are going to have come the Tranny Revolution. Like, literally, I have sat here for five minutes attempting to figure out every benefit that cis people get from transphobia, and the list looks like this:
- Does not have to remember weird pronouns.
- Is allowed to laugh at Ace Ventura Pet Detective.
And Ace Ventura Pet Detective isn’t that funny of a movie anyway.
Now, I’m not saying that privileged people never get any sort of benefit from privilege whatsoever. My clothes are cheaper than they would have been if the nice workers in China had been paid a living wage, and that’s my class and country privilege acting up. In a Social Justice Utopia, my clothes would probably be more expen

What kind of style does the bride have that impresses the author
------------correct----------------------
I knew the shoes on the last post would get everyone excited…but, for me, it’s the absolutely lovely bride and her eclectic, vintage chic style that really soars in this wedding. She just seems like the kind of girl that I would want to be friends with…one who has her own sense of style, her own unique perspective.
By the way, the shoes were actually bought on the fly from a clearance rack at DSW! Again, SO the kind of girl that I want to be friends with!

Do riders really need to do stretches before they mount up? In a recent interview with Horse Network, performance coach, Steve Morris, of Morris Coaching in Calgary, Alberta says that the body is put under strain when a person has some muscles that are too short and some that are too long. By riding for hours every day, the muscle distortion piles up, especially over the years. Which areas are susceptible for equestrians? Not surprising, the hamstrings, the hips, and the groin. Why is your back hurting? “90% of the time it’s because your hip flexors are too tight, particularly in combination with tight hamstrings,” reveals Morris. By targeting these areas with pre- and/or post-ride stretching, you can help prevent muscle tearing and support the joints.
For hamstrings, Steve suggests combining a moving stretch with a stationary stretch. Hips respond well to a forward lunge position with your back knee on the ground.“You’re looking to get deep into a forward stretch across the front of the hip. You’re pushing your hip forward and down as deeply as possible, really thinking about the front of the hip being long and elastic,” he coaches. The more elasticity you can create in the groin, the less likely it is to tear. You’ll even find you have more strength. A muscle that has a good range of motion and elasticity is a stronger muscle,”
The groin is one of the most important stretches for riders as these muscles tend to get short and tight from holding onto the horse. Steve teaches a start with one leg out to the side in a deep static stretch to encourage the groin m

What specific complaints did detainees have regarding the treatment and recovery of personal items during deportation
------------correct----------------------
a dog...They asked if [I] wanted water, but when [I] responded ‘yes,’ they wouldn’t give [me] any,” a 16 year-old Guatemalan boy told interviewers.
About 10% of detainees reported physical abuse at some point. The report also documents 433 cases where detainees required medical treatment, with only 59 being allowed access to a doctor or medicine before deportation. Several of those taken into custody reported having their medications taken away from them and not returned.
Other items were frequently not returned to migrants upon their release. Items commonly reported as taken included cash, shoes, and identification documents.
Further complaints included intentional destruction of water jugs placed in the Sonora Desert by the No More Deaths group and repatriation (deportation) occurring after dark, which violates an agreement between the Mexican Consulate and US Customs and Border Protection. This practice allegedly endangers migrants, who are frequently in close proximity to criminal activity when they’re dropped off. 869 family members that were captured together ended up being deported at different times and in different locations, including 41 teens and 17 young children who were separated from parents.

Abtech Holdings Expands Oil & Gas Offering Across N. America: Validates Technology in Ten Shale Plays; Validates Cross-Linked Gel Frac Recycle Technology; Signs Four Teaming Agreements with Oil & Gas Services Companies
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., April 25, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Abtech Holdings, Inc. (OTC QB: ABHD) ("AbTech" or the "Company"), a full-service environmental technologies and engineering firm dedicated to providing innovative solutions to communities, industry and governments addressing issues of water pollution and contamination, today announced teaming agreements with four water service companies to facilitate the expansion of its oil & gas water management offering. The Company also has multiple additional teaming, licensing, and distribution agreements near final stages of completion.
Through its teaming agreements, AbTech and its teaming partners will be able to offer a full range of water treatment and management capabilities to their clients. AbTech has signed teaming agreements with:
- TETRA Technologies, Inc. – a Texas-based global, diversified oil and gas services company with employees and operations on five continents covering both onshore and offshore services. TETRA was recently named Water Management Company of the Year for the Northeast Region (Marcellus and Utica) at the Oil & Gas Awards.
- Crescent Services, LLC – an Oklahoma-based water management and environmental services company with over 700 employees and locations in eight states.
- Wastewater Solutions Unlimited, LLC – a Texas-based water treatment company with over 30 years of experience covering industrial and Oil & Gas water treatments.
- Ground/Water Treatment & Technology, Inc. – a New Jersey-based company that delivers water management and treatment services with over 17 years of experience and having treated in excess of 400 Million Barrels (16 Billion Gallons) of wastewater from hundreds of project sites throughout North America.
AbTech's Oil & Gas solutions combine best-of-breed commercial technologies, innovative systems engineering, and specialty technologies such as the Smart Sponge® de-oiling technology. The Company's Smart Sponge technology is gaining worldwide recognition as an effective tool in de-oiling applications for the Oil & Gas industry, after having validated its technology on the produced waters of ten different shale plays in the United States, including the Permian, Fayetteville, Bakken, Cana Woodford, Marcellus, Eagleford, Piceance, Frenchie Draw, and Utica shale plays. AbTech was recently named Water Management Company of the Year for the Gulf Coast region at the Oil & Gas Awards and last year's Technological Innovator of the Year at the World Shale Oil & Gas Awards.
AbTech is also announced the validation and scale-up of its cross-linked gel frac recycle unit. Cross-linked gels, one of the two main hydraulic fracturing fluid streams, include various agents to increase viscosity and otherwise improve the fracturing process. AbTech is scaling up its cross-linked gel frac recycle unit to meet the daily flowrate needs of operators particularly in liquid rich basins. AbTech recently validated its ability to remove up to 99% of key cross-link agents such as boron.
AbTech's Executive Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Business Development, Bjornulf White, stated, "We believe that AbTech's proven capabilities in complex water treatment, combined with the broader oil & gas industry-specific expertise of our teaming partners, will enable us to offer the best value to our clients, including delivery and operation of cost-effective, efficient water treatment systems to operators across the country and abroad. We have expanded our offerings to include mobile trailer-based treatment systems and fixed treatment systems for nearly any treatment need. AbTech is finding significant receptivity and interest amongst operators for our systems and have developed a strong pipeline of near term opportunities."

a dog...They asked if [I] wanted water, but when [I] responded ‘yes,’ they wouldn’t give [me] any,” a 16 year-old Guatemalan boy told interviewers.
About 10% of detainees reported physical abuse at some point. The report also documents 433 cases where detainees required medical treatment, with only 59 being allowed access to a doctor or medicine before deportation. Several of those taken into custody reported having their medications taken away from them and not returned.
Other items were frequently not returned to migrants upon their release. Items commonly reported as taken included cash, shoes, and identification documents.
Further complaints included intentional destruction of water jugs placed in the Sonora Desert by the No More Deaths group and repatriation (deportation) occurring after dark, which violates an agreement between the Mexican Consulate and US Customs and Border Protection. This practice allegedly endangers migrants, who are frequently in close proximity to criminal activity when they’re dropped off. 869 family members that were captured together ended up being deported at different times and in different locations, including 41 teens and 17 young children who were separated from parents.

------------question-----------------------
What is the importance of elasticity in the groin according to Steve Morris
------------correct----------------------
uscle to release.“The more elasticity you can create in the groin, the less likely it is to tear. You’ll even find you have more strength. A muscle that has a good range of motion and elasticity is a stronger muscle,” emphasizes Morris. “Finish with a Plié squat with the toes and knees turned out. You’re really trying to sit your bum deep into your Plié squat to find the groin stretch at the bottom of that.”
Other suggestions for your stretches:
- If you find one side is tighter, make sure you linger a little longer or “double dose” that side. For instance, if your left side is tighter, go left, right, left so it equalizes better. Your end game is to find symmetry and flexibility through the whole body.
- Find a time in the morning and/or evening when you might have a little bit of time to yourself so you can settle into your stretching more easily.
- You don’t want to protect and hold against any stretch. You want to be in a place where you’re comfortable enough that there’s a balance between intensity and ability. You want to feel able to get deep into that stretch and continue to find more depth as you go, using relaxing breath to help you get there.
- Repeat your stretch sequences in part or in sequence as often as possible.
“The more you can maintain yourself and keep yourself feeling limber and agile, the stronger you’ll feel and the less likely you’ll be injured,” Steve says, “so you can ride pain free and at the top of your game.” Sounds like this will work off the saddle too!

tion or customer passwords had been put at risk. It was, however, suspected that some non-financial customer information may have been exposed and a full review of security systems was undertaken.”
The important thing to note is that Paddy Power did *not* at this point inform its 650,000 affected users. Instead they waited until this week - four years later - after a Canadian man was found in possession of the stolen data.
Paddy Power says it “takes its responsibilities regarding customer data extremely seriously” and is now warning customers “proactively”, as clearly there could be other websites where affected users could be using the same question and answer as security measures. (As with passwords, you shouldn’t reuse your trusted question/answer either).
“We take our responsibilities regarding customer data extremely seriously and have conducted an extensive investigation into the breach and the recovered data,” said Paddy Power’s online managing director, Peter O’Donovan. “That investigation shows that there is no evidence that any customer accounts have been adversely impacted by this breach. We are communicating with all of the people whose details have been compromised to tell them what has happened.”
What’s going on here is really damage limitation. It’s not so much about limiting the damage done by the data stolen by the hackers four years ago, but minimising the damage caused by Paddy Power’s sloppy handling of the incident.
It should have warned their users about the security breach back in 2010, and advised them to review passwords and security questions/answers as a precaution. At the same time Paddy Power could have warned users about the risks of bogus emails and fraud connected with the personal data (names, dates of birth, addresses) that might have fallen into the hands of cybercriminals.
And they should have informed the data protection commissioners four years ago too.
Waiting four years to tell your customers and the authorities that your company has suffered a security breach isn’t just sloppy, it seems downright irresponsible to me.
It should have shared the bad news much earlier, and not tried to hide it away four years later on a webpage that few of its customers will ever visit.

------------question-----------------------
What are some examples of athletes demonstrating sportsmanship in difficult situations
------------correct----------------------
Too often these days, fans and athletes alike focus on the negative side of sports, whether it's a fight that breaks out on the field or trash talk off the field. Still, there are many instances of athletes taking the high road and doing the right thing. Here are five perfect examples of athletes showing us what sportsmanship is all about.
1. Bobby Jones, 1925 U.S. Open Assessed himself a one-stroke penalty on the par-4 11th hole for an infraction nobody saw. He’d eventually lose in a playoff. Praised for his honesty, Jones said, “You might as well praise a man for not robbing a bank.”
2. Armando Galarraga, Detroit Tigers, 2010 With Galarraga one out away from a perfect game, umpire Jim Joyce blew a call at first base to spoil the achievement. Rather than lash out, Galarraga defended Joyce and accepted his apology.
3. Shawn Crawford, 2008 Beijing Olympics
Finished fourth, but was awarded silver in the 200 meters after two runners were disqualified for lane violations. Feeling that Churandy Martin of the Netherlands Antilles had rightly earned the honor, Crawford sent him his medal.
“I know the rules are the rules. You step on the line, you’re disqualified. But when you’re running clear in your position and aren’t impeding in someone’s race and you barely touch the line? I felt that Churandy was robbed. He worked four years just like I did, went to practice and trained — probably threw up at practice like I did — night

------------question-----------------------
What themes are explored in Margo Lanagan's 'A Dark Red Love Knot' and Gregory Macguire's 'The Silk Road Runs Through Tupperneck, N. H.'
------------correct----------------------
to explore how dangerous trying to suppress things like love and desire can be, regardless of sexual orientation - Margo Lanagan's "A Dark Red Love Knot" is a bloody and grim tale of tragedy, and a flat-out devastating piece of writing. Finally, Gregory Macguire, author of the Wicked series, offers proof that knowing what we are is a process that never ends in "The Silk Road Runs Through Tupperneck, N. H.," a melancholy revisit of first love after twenty years' absence.
For more short fiction dealing with teen identity and sexual orientation, try Am I Blue? Coming Out from the Silence , edited by Marion Dane Bauer and featuring writers such as Bruce Coville, M. E. Kerr, and Jane Yolen. Ariel Schrag has published several "high school comic chronicles" in graphic format - try Awkward and Definition . Transgender and transitions of all kinds are explored in Julie Anne Peters' Luna , and identity is literally taken and rebuilt in Nicola Griffith's science fiction tale Slow River . For real-life accounts of young people's search for their sexual identities, try I'm Looking Through You: Growing Up Haunted , Jennifer Finney Boylan's memoir of growing up as a girl in a boy's body in a haunted house. Resources, first-hand accounts, and practical information and advice can be found in Kelly Huegel's GLBTQ: The Survival Guide for Queer and Questioning Teens . All of these and many more similar titles are excellent choices not only for those questioning their sexual identity, but for anyone (and that's really everyone) who has tried to truly understand themselves.

------------question-----------------------
How does the text differentiate between types of privilege
------------correct----------------------
sive.
But I do think that privilege is best understood as a two-tiered system. There are some people, and some types of privilege,for which you got benefits you didn’t have to earn and in a perfect world wouldn’t have– think about the thankfully-no-longer-existent right of men to have sex with their wives whenever they liked, without the wives having to consent. That kind of privilege deserves to disappear and should be given up or used for the benefit of greater equality, as much as is possible, by those who have it.
And there are the types of privilege for which you just don’t have to put up with the shit other people do or have the basic human rights that they don’t. The right to not get pulled over for driving while black. The right to get married to the person you love. The right to choose what will happen to your own body. That kind of privilege doesn’t need to be given up, obviously. It needs to be extended to everyone.
I wonder if people would be more willing to accept the concept of privilege if it were presented less as “you have advantages other people don’t” and more as “other people have disadvantages you have escaped.

What activities did the author engage in during the gap between posts
------------correct----------------------
Sorry about the long gap between posts. I was struck down before Christmas by that awful flu that hit so many of us.
Meanwhile, I had a photoshoot I organised for Q Magazine published in December. It was of the band Of Montreal having a life drawing session. I organised the studio, tutor, model, materials, etc. It was great fun and everyone enjoyed themselves. Have a look at the photos!
I also was model mentor for the BBC3 show Naked. This presented underconfident beauticians with a challenge - to model for a life drawing class! It's available to view on BBC iplayer for the next few weeks and is fascinating tv!
As well as being busy having flu (!) and doing the above, we've been having hen parties galore.

Sorry about the long gap between posts. I was struck down before Christmas by that awful flu that hit so many of us.
Meanwhile, I had a photoshoot I organised for Q Magazine published in December. It was of the band Of Montreal having a life drawing session. I organised the studio, tutor, model, materials, etc. It was great fun and everyone enjoyed themselves. Have a look at the photos!
I also was model mentor for the BBC3 show Naked. This presented underconfident beauticians with a challenge - to model for a life drawing class! It's available to view on BBC iplayer for the next few weeks and is fascinating tv!
As well as being busy having flu (!) and doing the above, we've been having hen parties galore.

------------question-----------------------
What has been the biggest adjustment for Webb as he transitions to playing at CU after his time at Kansas
------------correct----------------------
ional football and he had to understand what the situation is. Sometimes these young quarterbacks don't learn to throw the ball away. He's growing, but I think his best is still ahead of him.
"He's a fighter and tough guy, but it's learning to play smart at that position."
Webb has been staying at a Boulder hotel this month as he settles in at CU and starts to learn the offense and get to know teammates. He is participating in player organized throwing sessions and 7-on-7. He said one of the big early adjustments has been getting used to Nike balls after spending three years in Kansas throwing Wilson balls.
Webb said some of his interceptions at Kansas were fluky, but he acknowledges he has to do a better job of taking care of the ball if he hopes to earn the starting job with the Buffs. One of the primary reasons CU coaches chose Tyler Hansen as their starter last season was because he didn't throw interceptions during scrimmages in spring and fall camp.
"That's the number one job of the quarterback," Webb said. "If you're not able to take care of the ball, you're probably not going to be playing too long. If you look back on the (2011) stats, I don't think I threw my first interception until the fourth game. It's hard to say that's the number one thing I'm working on because I'm working on everything, but decision making is obviously up there."
Webb played in a spread offense at Kansas and was asked to run the ball at times. He said the CU pro style offense is very different from a formation and terminology standpoint, but there are concepts and routes within the scheme that are essentially the same.
He said his biggest challenge between now and the time camp opens and the competition starts is learning the offense. He doesn't want coaches to have to dumb down the offense when he's taking repetitions. Webb said Colorado coaches have asked him to take a leadership role and be assertive.
So, considering Webb has played in 21 college games with more than a dozen starts and only one other CU quarterback has college experience (sophomore Nick Hirschman), shouldn't he be the starter?
"I would like to think that would be the case, but nothing has been guaranteed to me," Webb said. "What it's going to come down to is that fall camp and having a grasp of the offense, taking control in the huddle and really asserting myself as a leader."
Long isn't making any predictions because he doesn't know a lot about the other quarterbacks on Colorado's roster, but he does believe that Webb's experience and the fact that the other Buffs are still wet behind the ears favors Webb.
"He's very tough," Long said. "He's one of the tougher guys that I've coached. He's got very good mechanics and he's got a very strong arm. He has some athleticism to him. He can run the ball as well. I think his best trait is he's an excellent competitor."

What threats were made against Mark Sanchez on Twitter after the losing game against the Tennessee Titans
------------correct----------------------
Monday was not a good night for Mark Sanchez -- much like 2012 has not been a good season for the Jets.
During Monday night's losing game against the Tennessee Titans, a crazed fan took to Twitter to post a barrage of death threats against the beleaguered quarterback. Yahoo Sports reports the genius -- who was clearly looking to make a name for himself by addressing some tweets to Fox News -- made specific threats that he would kill Sanchez at this week's practice.
"Don't come to practice Wednesday I promise you bullets everywhere," the suspect tweeter wrote to Sanchez. The person, whose twitter account has been removed, also addressed the Jets, "Sanchez better have armed security at practice !! You think imma sit here and watch this bull**** ?"

"At the dawn of the scientific-technical

how to embody the most ancient occult sciences and hidden potentials of
mankind's psyche in technical weapons in order to, with their help, make
their own populations obediently conformist, blindly fulfilling the

Though it is beyond the scope of this
book to delve too deeply into the life and genius of
Tesla, it would be impossible to address our subject matter
without covering at least the basics, because a lot of what has been
deployed since 911 are actually forms of Tesla technology which have been
willfully hidden for many years.
According to Tesla's FBI file (1),
upon his death the personal items belonging to him, including most of his
documentation, were impounded by the office of Alien Property, Department of
Justice. Many Freedom of information Act requests have been made to the FBI
concerning these personal goods of Nikola Tesla, especially concerning the
notes and books, and these requests, numbering in the hundreds or even
thousands - have come up empty.
There are some of Tesla's private communications
and publications among the public though, and most of these papers are
extremely collectible and valuable.
The United States Navy is mentioned several times within the heavily
redacted FBI records of Nikola Tesla, as well as among many other references
to Tesla's work, up to and including the modern HAARP program, which will be
covered in some depth later.
The overall conclusion most researchers have drawn is that Tesla’s work was
first buried, then developed clandestinely by secret groups within the
government of the United States. There is a lot of evidence for this
proposal; judging from other cases concerning government experimentation in
mind control and behavior modification, a reader/researcher may at least
begin to see that this is the way the United States government generally
operates, while spouting a creed of DENY DENY DENY, even when faced with
proof positive of their activities.
Because this is the same government which writes
the laws, they naturally exempt themselves from any kind of accountability
that way as well. A police state cannot occur without a secrecy regime
Fortunately for us, Nikola Tesla did a pretty good job of making most of his
work publicly known in books, magazines and patents before his death, in
spite of the fact that most people found his work incomprehensible while he
was alive. It is now possible to do a little reading, and get a decent
picture of what has happened, and what is just beginning to happen after all
these years again.
Tesla was born in Smiljan, Croatia in 1865, and he showed intellectual
restlessness, some say precociousness, at an early age. Tesla's father was a
clergyman, and had planned a life in the priesthood for his son, though
Nikola prevailed upon him for advanced schooling in what he loved: machinery
and electricity; eventually he was allowed to pursue an engineering degree
at the Technical University at Graz Austria, and the University of Prague.
In 1882 Tesla traveled to Paris France, where he
found work with the Continental Edison Company. It was there Tesla began
visualizing motors powered with alternating current (AC).
At that time direct current (DC) was all the
rage, being used by the world entire to power experiments and new
inventions, even though DC was dangerous and inefficient compared to
alternating current. Nobody wanted to hear about improvements from a young
super-unknown such as Nikola Tesla, so the young scientist did what any good
maverick would do: he split the scene for better opportunities elsewhere.
Tesla came to America in 1884, and for a short time he worked with Thomas
Edison himself, but the two did not see things eye to eye at all, and Tesla
quickly left the Edison Labs. He soon proved his superiority in certain
aspects of the electrical sciences though, and went on to develop patents in
his own name, which later became a large part of the Westinghouse
Corporation, and more.
Many of Tesla's patents went without development
in his later years, and Nikola Tesla died in 1943 with some of his later
inventions never being realized, except on paper. Some of the inventions by
Nikola Tesla that were developed are the polyphase induction (Electric)
motor, neon and fluorescent lights, the automobile ignition system, and 2 &
3 phase alternating current.
Nikola Tesla was also responsible for almost all wireless technologies.
Though Marconi is given credit for the radio, it was Tesla who actually
developed the science and patented it, along with other novel and powerful
wireless technologies. From The Journal of The International Tesla Society,
Power and Resonance, vol. 6, no. 4:
"Tesla's most important work at the end of
the nineteenth century was his original system of transmission of energy
by wireless antenna. In 1900 Tesla obtained two fundamental patents (#’s
645,576 and 649,6212) on the transmission of true wireless energy
covering both methods and apparatus and involving the use of four tuned
In 1943 (3 months after Tesla's death -
Ed.), the Supreme Court of the United States granted full patent rights
to Nikola Tesla for the invention of the radio, superseding and
nullifying any prior claim by Marconi and others in regards to the
"Fundamental Radio Patent"..."
A dream of Nikola Tesla was free wireless power
for the world.
This was the main reason behind the construction
of his various and well known (Wardenclyffe/Colorado Springs) antennae, but
it was also to be his ultimate undoing, because it discouraged his two main
financiers, George Westinghouse, of the Westinghouse Electric Company, and
J.P. Morgan; both were heavily vested in metered electricity-for-money
These same people then invited him to invent
military weapons technologies as a means to further financing, although this
went against the scientists basic ideals. Later he became so strapped for
money that he began thinking along these lines, but by then he had scared
the moguls of finance so badly they wanted nothing to do with him.
One of the Tesla inventions (Patent 1,119,732) designed to create wireless
power resulted in what he called his Magnifying Transmitter, which has since
come to be called the Tesla Magnifying Transmitter, or TMT.

come to be called the Tesla Magnifying Transmitter, or TMT.

to explore how dangerous trying to suppress things like love and desire can be, regardless of sexual orientation - Margo Lanagan's "A Dark Red Love Knot" is a bloody and grim tale of tragedy, and a flat-out devastating piece of writing. Finally, Gregory Macguire, author of the Wicked series, offers proof that knowing what we are is a process that never ends in "The Silk Road Runs Through Tupperneck, N. H.," a melancholy revisit of first love after twenty years' absence.
For more short fiction dealing with teen identity and sexual orientation, try Am I Blue? Coming Out from the Silence , edited by Marion Dane Bauer and featuring writers such as Bruce Coville, M. E. Kerr, and Jane Yolen. Ariel Schrag has published several "high school comic chronicles" in graphic format - try Awkward and Definition . Transgender and transitions of all kinds are explored in Julie Anne Peters' Luna , and identity is literally taken and rebuilt in Nicola Griffith's science fiction tale Slow River . For real-life accounts of young people's search for their sexual identities, try I'm Looking Through You: Growing Up Haunted , Jennifer Finney Boylan's memoir of growing up as a girl in a boy's body in a haunted house. Resources, first-hand accounts, and practical information and advice can be found in Kelly Huegel's GLBTQ: The Survival Guide for Queer and Questioning Teens . All of these and many more similar titles are excellent choices not only for those questioning their sexual identity, but for anyone (and that's really everyone) who has tried to truly understand themselves.

An Army veteran who survived being shot 13 times while serving in Iraq was able to walk across the stage at Middle Tennessee State University on Saturday, thanks to the help from an on-campus organization.
Jay Strobino was injured in 2006, getting shot at close range and leaving the entire right side of his body riddled with bullets.
His company with the 101st Airborne Division was on a mission to grab a high-profile target when they were ambushed by enemy fighters. One militant fired at Strobino.
“He came back around and he shot me again, and right before he shot me again I was like, ‘this is it.’ That was it, all I could do was roll over and take the brunt of it again," Strobino told FOX17.

What preceding experiences could assist Jordan Webb in becoming a competitive college quarterback at the University of Colorado
------------correct----------------------
The man who coached Jordan Webb the past two seasons at Kansas says he has the talent and tenacity to become a standout college quarterback in the second half of his career.
Former Kansas offensive coordinator Chuck Long said Webb, who transferred to the University of Colorado this month after graduating from KU, has learned a lot of tough lessons over the past two seasons as a redshirt freshman and sophomore. He said CU coaches are getting a mature player who has been through the fire.
"He basically has one year of starting under his belt, and I think right now he's a young man who will begin to come in to his own in the next couple years," Long said. "He's poised and ready to take it to the next step. That was kind of the path we had him on. I know he's in good hands with the coaching staff there. I think you will see Jordan blossom."
Long left Kansas after last season when head coach Turner Gill was fired after going 5-19 in two seasons at the helm of a program that played in a BCS bowl game in the 2007 season. Webb played in many of those games over the two years under Gill and Long and brings much more experience to the table than any of the young quarterbacks on the CU roster, even though it's losing experience.
Webb will be able to compete for the starting job when fall camp opens Aug. 7 because he earned his degree at KU, making him eligible under NCAA rules without having to sit out a year. He has two years of eligibility remaining.
Webb said he had to pass 28 credit hours between January and the end of June to graduate and give himself a chance to play for the Buffs. It doesn't surprise Long that Webb found a way to make it happen.
"He will make the position very competitive," Long said.
Long said when Webb first joined the Kansas program out of high school in St. Louis, it took him awhile to learn to become a student of the game and to take all of his coaching to heart. Long said Webb made drastic improvements in those areas over the past two years.
Webb completed 179 of 281 passes for 1,884 yards and 13 touchdowns with 12 interceptions last year. He has thrown 20 touchdowns and 20 interceptions to this point in his career, a fact that raised some skeptical eyebrows from CU fans who questioned why coach Jon Embree wanted add Webb to the roster.
Long said Webb's high interception numbers at KU are the result of multiple factors. He said Webb never learned to throw the ball away in high school and it took him awhile to get used to the idea that it's OK to do so at the college level. He said Webb's competitive spirit sometimes led him to make poor decisions trying to make plays with his team often trailing by large deficits. And Long said mistakes by teammates and good plays by defenders also contributed to Webb's interception totals.
"He had to learn to play smarter," Long said. "Quarterbacking is situat

Still, there are many instances of athletes taking the high road and doing the right thing. Here are five perfect examples of athletes showing us what sportsmanship is all about.
1. Bobby Jones, 1925 U.S. Open Assessed himself a one-stroke penalty on the par-4 11th hole for an infraction nobody saw. He’d eventually lose in a playoff. Praised for his honesty, Jones said, “You might as well praise a man for not robbing a bank.”
2. Armando Galarraga, Detroit Tigers, 2010 With Galarraga one out away from a perfect game, umpire Jim Joyce blew a call at first base to spoil the achievement. Rather than lash out, Galarraga defended Joyce and accepted his apology.
3. Shawn Crawford, 2008 Beijing Olympics
Finished fourth, but was awarded silver in the 200 meters after two runners were disqualified for lane violations. Feeling that Churandy Martin of the Netherlands Antilles had rightly earned the honor, Crawford sent him his medal.
“I know the rules are the rules. You step on the line, you’re disqualified. But when you’re running clear in your position and aren’t impeding in someone’s race and you barely touch the line? I felt that Churandy was robbed. He worked four years just like I did, went to practice and trained — probably threw up at practice like I did — night

Презентация на конкурс «Радуга презентаций – 2015» My favorite poet Автор: Анастасия Геннадиевна Моисеева, учитель английского языка МБОУ СОШ 7, г. Мичуринска
William Shakespeare 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616 His extant works, including some collaborations, consist of about 38 plays,154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, of which the authorship of some is uncertain. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.
Sonnet 130 My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun; Coral is far more red than her lips' red; If snow be white; why then her breasts are dun; If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head. I have seen roses damasked, red and white, But no such roses see I in her cheeks, And in some perfumes is there more delight Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks. I love to hear her speak, yet well I know That music hath a far more pleasing sound; I grant I never saw a goddess go - My mistress when she walks treads on the ground. And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare As any she belied with false compare.
Sergei Yesenin 3 October 1895 – 28 December 1925 He was one of Russia's most popular poets, most of his writings were banned by the Kremlin. Only in 1966 were most of his works republished. Today Yesenin's poems are taught to Russian schoolchildren; many have been set to music and recorded as popular songs. His early death, coupled with unsympathetic views by some of the literary elite, adoration by ordinary people, and sensational behavior, all contributed to the enduring and near mythical popular image of the Russian poet.
Silver road, I wonder where You are calling me anew? Like a Thursday candle there Shines a starlet over you. Are you fraught with joy or sorrow? Isnt madness your intent? Help me, heart and soul, tomorrow Love your hard snow to the end. Give me sunset for the sleigh and Willow branch that beautifies. Maybe I will in the end Reach the gate of paradise.
George Gordon Byron 22 January 1788 – 19 April 1824 Lord Byron, was an English poet and a leading figure in the Romantic movement. Among Byron's best-known works are the lengthy narrative poems Don Juan and Childe Harold's Pilgrimage and the short lyric She Walks in Beauty.
She walks in Beauty, like the night Of cloudless climes and starry skies; And all that's best of dark and bright Meet in her aspect and her eyes: Thus mellowed to that tender light Which Heaven to gaudy day denies. One shade the more, one ray the less, Had half impaired the nameless grace Which waves in every raven tress, Or softly lightens o'er her face; Where thoughts serenely sweet express, How pure, how dear their dwelling-place. And on that cheek, and o'er that brow, So soft, so calm, yet eloquent, The smiles that win, the tints that glow, But tell of days in goodness spent, A mind at peace with all below, A heart whose love is innocent!
Anna Akhmatova 23 June 1889 – 5 March 1966 She was a Russian modernist poet, one of the most acclaimed writers in the Russian canon. Her talent in composition and translation is evidenced in her fine translations of the works of poets writing in French, English, Italian, Armenian, and Korean.
I crave for the roses and garden my best, Thats clad in the best in the word airy fence. Where statues remember me youthful and blessed, And I – them all covered by Nevas cold waves. In silence, so fragrant, amidst limes of kings, I hear: the ship's masts are squeaking in swings. And sails the white swain through the ages again, Enjoying the charm of his brother-of-twain. And deadly sleep hundreds of thousands steps Of friends and of foes, of foes and friends. And the train of shadows has no the end From vases granite to t

r the game, came the news that Sanchez is benched -- because apparently Jets head coach Rex Ryan believes in the "better late than never" approach. Ryan now provides the "WTF" moment of the season, announcing Tuesday he plans to start Greg McElroy -- the third string QB -- instead of Tim Tebow.
This bizarre decision will surely prompt conspiracy theorists to wonder if there is some behind the scenes payoff being offered to keep Tebow off the field. Because, really? McElroy? Really.
ESPN reports Ryan has no good explanation for the mysterious move, telling reporters, "I can answer this question a million ways -- frontward, backward, sideways, anything else. It's my decision and I based it on a gut feeling or whatever."

------------answer-----------------------
ional football and he had to understand what the situation is. Sometimes these young quarterbacks don't learn to throw the ball away. He's growing, but I think his best is still ahead of him.
"He's a fighter and tough guy, but it's learning to play smart at that position."
Webb has been staying at a Boulder hotel this month as he settles in at CU and starts to learn the offense and get to know teammates. He is participating in player organized throwing sessions and 7-on-7. He said one of the big early adjustments has been getting used to Nike balls after spending three years in Kansas throwing Wilson balls.
Webb said some of his interceptions at Kansas were fluky, but he acknowledges he has to do a better job of taking care of the ball if he hopes to earn the starting job with the Buffs. One of the primary reasons CU coaches chose Tyler Hansen as their starter last season was because he didn't throw interceptions during scrimmages in spring and fall camp.
"That's the number one job of the quarterback," Webb said. "If you're not able to take care of the ball, you're probably not going to be playing too long. If you look back on the (2011) stats, I don't think I threw my first interception until the fourth game. It's hard to say that's the number one thing I'm working on because I'm working on everything, but decision making is obviously up there."
Webb played in a spread offense at Kansas and was asked to run the ball at times. He said the CU pro style offense is very different from a formation and terminology standpoint, but there are concepts and routes within the scheme that are essentially the same.
He said his biggest challenge between now and the time camp opens and the competition starts is learning the offense. He doesn't want coaches to have to dumb down the offense when he's taking repetitions. Webb said Colorado coaches have asked him to take a leadership role and be assertive.
So, considering Webb has played in 21 college games with more than a dozen starts and only one other CU quarterback has college experience (sophomore Nick Hirschman), shouldn't he be the starter?
"I would like to think that would be the case, but nothing has been guaranteed to me," Webb said. "What it's going to come down to is that fall camp and having a grasp of the offense, taking control in the huddle and really asserting myself as a leader."
Long isn't making any predictions because he doesn't know a lot about the other quarterbacks on Colorado's roster, but he does believe that Webb's experience and the fact that the other Buffs are still wet behind the ears favors Webb.
"He's very tough," Long said. "He's one of the tougher guys that I've coached. He's got very good mechanics and he's got a very strong arm. He has some athleticism to him. He can run the ball as well. I think his best trait is he's an excellent competitor."

s of breathlessness and days where you wanted to sleep. For four years... I felt like he ran a second-place race. He beat us by a considerable margin, from second to third. I know I put in the work, and I go out there and expect to earn my position. I felt like I was beat fair and square.
“When Churandy received my medal, he was surprised. He couldn’t believe that I was doing it. At first, he didn’t accept it. He understood my argument, but wanted to make sure that’s really what I wanted to do. But he has so much respect for me now. We’re really cool, and it’s a great relationship. To me, that’s more important. If I had kept the medal, I probably never would have known much about him. Just ‘hi’ and ‘bye,’ every time I saw him. I like the relationship we have built. It’s important to have good relationships and friendships in life. You only live once, and it’s a short life.”

To me, that’s more important. If I had kept the medal, I probably never would have known much about him. Just ‘hi’ and ‘bye,’ every time I saw him. I like the relationship we have built. It’s important to have good relationships and friendships in life. You only live once, and it’s a short life.”

------------question-----------------------
What types of privilege does the author identify and how do they relate to resources like clothing
------------correct----------------------
I think there’s an aspect of privilege that a lot of people haven’t really paid attention to: there are at least two kinds of it.
I see some people in the social justice community saying things like, “cis people benefit from transphobia.” But the thing is, they really, really don’t. Everything cis people have that trans people don’t– from the low chance of being murdered to the ability to have people respect their pronouns– is something that cis people are going to have come the Tranny Revolution. Like, literally, I have sat here for five minutes attempting to figure out every benefit that cis people get from transphobia, and the list looks like this:
- Does not have to remember weird pronouns.
- Is allowed to laugh at Ace Ventura Pet Detective.
And Ace Ventura Pet Detective isn’t that funny of a movie anyway.
Now, I’m not saying that privileged people never get any sort of benefit from privilege whatsoever. My clothes are cheaper than they would have been if the nice workers in China had been paid a living wage, and that’s my class and country privilege acting up. In a Social Justice Utopia, my clothes would probably be more expen

------------question-----------------------
What does the author believe should take precedence: citizenship in the United States or being a Christian, and why
------------correct----------------------
such complex and passionate issues, it is never a bad idea to remind myself – Bruce, you are first a citizen of the Body of Christ and then a citizen of the United States of America.
When such difficult questions before us as a country, I must constantly commit to being a Christian who happens to be an American and not the other way around. For if I confuse the two, my independent American sensibilities and the pursuit of my own individual rights will too often result in just the opposite being inflicted up those whom my Christian faith calls me to love and serve. If my citizenship trumps my faith, the pursuit of my own life, liberty and happiness will lead directly and indirectly to the death, oppression and despair for the stranger, the enemy, the prisoner, the poor, the outcast, the hungry and the oppressed.
Does this mean that I want the United States to become a theocracy governed by a less than unanimous understanding of the Christian faith, of course not. And are there times when my faith and citizenship align, sure. The big takeaway for this Christian, who cherishes the opportunities to dialogue about the politics and policies of our country, is that I must be open to solutions to complex issues that might indeed infringe upon my own independence and personal gain so others may thrive. For in the end, our life does not belong to the United States of America, in life and in death, we belong to God.
Woe to me if I confuse the two

What was the inspiration for the design of the pendant mentioned in the text

, resulting in a pretty amusing list: How much does a sausage weigh? Are men or women usually barbecuing? What does bubblegum taste like? How smart is a person blowing bubbles, and how big can those bubbles be?
The concept for a pendant came to her in the middle of a sleepless night. “A few years ago, I had a long discussion with a lamp maker about the problem that glass lamps don’t hang straight,” she tells Co.Design. “So in this project, I used that as a positive force. It was super simple--I used gravity, moved the wire off-center, and voila!”
When presented together with the wurst--which is, in fact, sandblasted, colored glass--the result is a truly strange sensual experience. And after seeing Sam Baron's stunning and oh-so-delicate glass sausage display in the NoHo Design District a few years back, all it takes is one more and we’ve got a trend, right

Monday was not a good night for Mark Sanchez -- much like 2012 has not been a good season for the Jets.
During Monday night's losing game against the Tennessee Titans, a crazed fan took to Twitter to post a barrage of death threats against the beleaguered quarterback. Yahoo Sports reports the genius -- who was clearly looking to make a name for himself by addressing some tweets to Fox News -- made specific threats that he would kill Sanchez at this week's practice.
"Don't come to practice Wednesday I promise you bullets everywhere," the suspect tweeter wrote to Sanchez. The person, whose twitter account has been removed, also addressed the Jets, "Sanchez better have armed security at practice !! You think imma sit here and watch this bull**** ?"

What is Edward Lear primarily known for in his literary career
------------correct----------------------
he palace of grand. There whisper each other my white nightly skies Of somebodys love, very secret and high. And all shines with jasper and pearl in the night… But nobody knows a source of the light.
Edward Lear 12 or 13 May January 1888 He was an English artist, illustrator, musician, author and poet, and is known now mostly for his literary nonsense in poetry and prose and especially his limericks, a form he popularized. As an author, he is known principally for his popular nonsense collections of poems, songs, short stories, botanical drawings, recipes, and alphabets.
There was a Young Lady whose chin, Resembled the point of a pin; So she had it made sharp, And purchased a harp, And played several tunes with her chin. *** There was an Old Man in a boat, Who said, 'I'm afloat, I'm afloat!' When they said, 'No! you ain't!' He was ready to faint, That unhappy Old Man in a boat. There was an Old Man of Moldavia, Who had the most curious behavior; For while he was able, He slept on a table. That funny Old Man of Moldavia. *** There was an Old Man of Peru, Who never knew what he should do; So he tore off his hair, And behaved like a bear, That intrinsic Old Man of Peru.
Thomas More 7 February 1478 – 6 July 1535 He was an English lawyer, social philosopher, author, statesman and noted Renaissance humanist. He was also a councilor to Henry VIII and Lord Chancellor from October 1529 to 16 May 1532.
Those evening bells! How many a tale their music tells, Of youth, and home, and those sweet time, When last I heard their soothing chime. Those joyous hours are passed away; And many a heart, that then was gay, Within the tomb now darkly dwells, And hears no more those evening bells. And sot will be when I am gone; That tuneful peal will still ring on, While other bards shall walk these dells, And sing your praise, sweet evening bells.
John Keats 31 October 1795 – 23 February 1821 He was an English Romantic poet. He was one of the main figures of the second generation of Romantic poets along with Lord Byron, despite his work having been in publication for only four years before his death. Although his poems were not generally well received by critics during his life, his reputation grew after his death, so that by the end of the 19th century, he had become one of the most beloved of all English poets.
THE GRASSHOPPER AND CRICKET The poetry of earth is never dead: When all the birds are faint with the hot sun, And hide in cooling trees, a voice will run From hedge to hedge about the new- mown mead; That is the Grasshopper's – he takes the lead In summer luxury, - he has never done With his delights; for when tired out with fun He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed. The poetry of earth is ceasing never: On a lone winter evening, when the frost Has wrought a silence, from the stove there shrills The Cricket's song, in warmth increasing ever, And seems to one in drowsiness half lost, The Grasshopper's among some grassy hills.
Alexander Blok 28 November 1880 – 7 August 1921 He the greatest of the Russian Symbolists, progressed from the ethereal purity of Verses about the Beautiful Lady (1904) to the powerful expressiveness of his mature manner, fully developed by His last masterpiece is The Twelve, a long poem which expresses his short-lived enthusiasm for the Revolution.
I see the long forgotten blaze, And I can clearly hear, in silence, Another song behind the violins, The chesty voice that filled the space. Thats how she answered all my pledges, My love and passion, first and last, I recognize it when the blast Of wind and blizzard wails and rages. The past has gone without a trace, And only some ones aspiration Reminds me somehow, with good grace, Of happiness and exultation.

I was familiar with the remake of "I Am The Black Gold of the Sun", I enjoyed most of rest of the cd as well, the fusion of the different styles - jazz, dance, Latin, it is always good to hear music that doesn't recognize barriers, but of course, there is little place on radio for such music.
Throughout my life.......

".... I hope to hear this album on a weekly basis. I bought the NuYoricanSoul album when it first came out and still,whenever I go into a bar, a restaurant or a club and hear the soulful tones of India and Jocelyn Brown, accompanied by Roy Ayers, George Benson and Tito Puente, Mastered by MAW (Lil' Louie Vega - The Bucketheads - and Kenny Dope Gonzalez).... I die and go to heaven. This is the music that you would want to accompany your laid-back, funky, sunny, HAPPY lifestyle. Since this album blew up, nobody has been able to match it.Everyone who has this agrees that it is one of the best albums to come out of the 90's, and it's relatively undiscovered by the vultures, so it hasn't dated in trend or reputation. What makes it so

Sorry about the long gap between posts. I was struck down before Christmas by that awful flu that hit so many of us.
Meanwhile, I had a photoshoot I organised for Q Magazine published in December. It was of the band Of Montreal having a life drawing session. I organised the studio, tutor, model, materials, etc. It was great fun and everyone enjoyed themselves. Have a look at the photos!
I also was model mentor for the BBC3 show Naked. This presented underconfident beauticians with a challenge - to model for a life drawing class! It's available to view on BBC iplayer for the next few weeks and is fascinating tv!
As well as being busy having flu (!) and doing the above, we've been having hen parties galore.
Ladies, it's the best fun thing for a hen party ever!

“When Churandy received my medal, he was surprised. He couldn’t believe that I was doing it. At first, he didn’t accept it. He understood my argument, but wanted to make sure that’s really what I wanted to do. But he has so much respect for me now. We’re really cool, and it’s a great relationship. To me, that’s more important. If I had kept the medal, I probably never would have known much about him. Just ‘hi’ and ‘bye,’ every time I saw him. I like the relationship we have built. It’s important to have good relationships and friendships in life. You only live once, and it’s a short life.”

What specific actions is Beyond Nuclear seeking from the NRC concerning the General Electric Mark I reactors
------------correct----------------------
Beyond Nuclear “Freeze Our Fukushimas” petition accepted in part by NRC: Prompts deeper investigation of GE Mark I reactors
On August 16, 2011, a Petition Review Board of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) provided its recommendations to accept and reject in part emergency enforcement actions requested by Beyond Nuclear in an April 13, 2011 petition regarding the 23 Fukushima-style reactors now operating in the US.
The Beyond Nuclear petition, which NRC confirms includes more than 5,000 additional co-petitioner requests from around the country, seeks to suspend the operation of the dangerous and deeply flawed General Electric Mark I Boiling Water Reactors until certain safety conditions are met. The NRC review board will now look further into several of Beyond Nuclear’s requested actions.
The petitioners are seeking to have the agency; 1) hold public hearings in each of the emergency planning zones for the Fukushima-style reactors; 2) revoke the agency’s 1989 NRC prior approval allowing nuclear power plant operators to “voluntarily” install the same radioactive containment venting system demonstrated at Fukushima Daiichi to have a 100% failure rate during a severe nuclear accident and; 3) issue an Order to all GE Mark I operators to immediately install dedicated emergency back-up electrical power systems to keep cooling the densely-packed nuclear waste storage pools that sit atop each of the reactors in the event of simu

Report Documents Border Patrol Abuses
No More Deaths/No Mas Muertes, a group based out of Tucson, Arizona that provides humanitarian aid to migrants crossing the US/Mexico border illegally, has released a new report documenting the abuse of immigrants in the custody of the US Border Patrol.
“A Culture of Cruelty: Abuse and Impunity in Short-Term US Border Patrol Custody,” follows up on the group’s “Crossing the Line: Human Rights Abuses of Migrants in Short-Term Custody,” which was released in 2008. Over three years, No More Deaths interviewed approximately 13,000 migrants who had been detained by Border Patrol officers, claiming to document 30,000 instances of abuse. Common complaints include physical abuse, denial of medical treatment for wounds suffered during the border crossing attempt or at the hands of officers, and denial of sufficient food and water.
Specifically, 2,981 people claimed they were given no food and 11,384 said they received only items such as cracker packets or juice boxes. 80% of those in custody for more than two days did not receive a full meal during that time. 863 migrants claimed they were not allowed any access to water, even though many apprehended were suffering from dehydration.

The NRC review process will now consider the review board’s recommendation to “accept” in part Beyond Nuclear’s requested actions for additional investigation to include:
(1) “Immediately revoke prior pre-approval of the hardened vent system or direct torus vent system at each GE BWR Mark I unit under the provisions of 10 CFR 50.59,” and;
(2) “Immediately issue Confirmatory Action Orders to all GE BWR Mark I units to promptly install safety-related backup electrical power (Class E-1) and additional backup DC battery system to ensure reliable supply for the spent fuel pool cooling system.”
The review board further recommended that the agency “reject” in part Beyond Nuclear’s requested actions for any further review to include;
1) “Immediately suspend operating licenses of all GE BWR Mark I units pending full NRC review with independent expert and public participation from the affected emergency planning zone communities,” and;
2) “Conduct public meetings within each of the ten-mile emergency planning zone for each GE BWR site for the purpose of receiving public comment and independent expert testimony regarding the reliability of hardened vent system or direct torus vent system.”
You can still take action and become a co-petitioner with Beyond Nuclear's "Freeze Our Fukushimas" petition.

The man who coached Jordan Webb the past two seasons at Kansas says he has the talent and tenacity to become a standout college quarterback in the second half of his career.
Former Kansas offensive coordinator Chuck Long said Webb, who transferred to the University of Colorado this month after graduating from KU, has learned a lot of tough lessons over the past two seasons as a redshirt freshman and sophomore. He said CU coaches are getting a mature player who has been through the fire.
"He basically has one year of starting under his belt, and I think right now he's a young man who will begin to come in to his own in the next couple years," Long said. "He's poised and ready to take it to the next step. That was kind of the path we had him on. I know he's in good hands with the coaching staff there. I think you will see Jordan blossom."
Long left Kansas after last season when head coach Turner Gill was fired after going 5-19 in two seasons at the helm of a program that played in a BCS bowl game in the 2007 season. Webb played in many of those games over the two years under Gill and Long and brings much more experience to the table than any of the young quarterbacks on the CU roster, even though it's losing experience.
Webb will be able to compete for the starting job when fall camp opens Aug. 7 because he earned his degree at KU, making him eligible under NCAA rules without having to sit out a year. He has two years of eligibility remaining.
Webb said he had to pass 28 credit hours between January and the end of June to graduate and give himself a chance to play for the Buffs. It doesn't surprise Long that Webb found a way to make it happen.
"He will make the position very competitive," Long said.
Long said when Webb first joined the Kansas program out of high school in St. Louis, it took him awhile to learn to become a student of the game and to take all of his coaching to heart. Long said Webb made drastic improvements in those areas over the past two years.
Webb completed 179 of 281 passes for 1,884 yards and 13 touchdowns with 12 interceptions last year. He has thrown 20 touchdowns and 20 interceptions to this point in his career, a fact that raised some skeptical eyebrows from CU fans who questioned why coach Jon Embree wanted add Webb to the roster.
Long said Webb's high interception numbers at KU are the result of multiple factors. He said Webb never learned to throw the ball away in high school and it took him awhile to get used to the idea that it's OK to do so at the college level. He said Webb's competitive spirit sometimes led him to make poor decisions trying to make plays with his team often trailing by large deficits. And Long said mistakes by teammates and good plays by defenders also contributed to Webb's interception totals.
"He had to learn to play smarter," Long said. "Quarterbacking is situat

What details were compromised in the recent data breach at Paddy Power
------------correct----------------------
Yesterday, popular gambling website Paddy Power found itself admitting that it had suffered a serious data breach - the kind of position that no company ever wants to find itself in.
Not that you would know if you visited their website, of course. Because there’s no mention of the issue on the front page that their customers visit. Instead they will need to find the link buried away in their press release section.
But when you dig into the details of this particular breach, and its public disclosure, you find things are actually a lot worse.
Firstly, this wasn’t a breach involving a small number of customers. Paddy Power believes that the personal details of almost 650,000 customers (649,055 if we’re being precise) were put at risk by hackers who broke into the company’s computer systems.
That’s a lot of gambling customers who have been exposed to more risk than perhaps they feel comfortable with.
Secondly, although financial information such as credit card details were not compromised (thank goodness) there was an awful lot of information which was - including customers’ names, usernames, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth and “prompted question and answer”.
Even though no passwords were grabbed by the hackers, there are still plenty of ways in which fraudsters and online criminals could exploit the information which has been exposed. For instance, it’s simple to imagine carefully crafted emails could be sent to customers (using the personal information taken from the stolen user database to make them appear more convincing) that could be designed to trick innocent victims into revealing more details about themselves, or clicking on dangerous links that could put their computers and their financial information at greater risk.
Thirdly, Paddy Power is at pains to point out that the incident has “no impact on customers who opened accounts after 2010”.
Now, you may think that’s good news - but dig a little deeper into the story and the truth tumbles out.
You see, Paddy Power first identified that it had been hacked back in 2010.
In its own words:
“Paddy Power had detected malicious activity in an attempted breach of its data security system in 2010. A detailed investigation was undertaken at the time and determined that no financial informa

Secondly, although financial information such as credit card details were not compromised (thank goodness) there was an awful lot of information which was - including customers’ names, usernames, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth and “prompted question and answer”.
Even though no passwords were grabbed by the hackers, there are still plenty of ways in which fraudsters and online criminals could exploit the information which has been exposed. For instance, it’s simple to imagine carefully crafted emails could be sent to customers (using the personal information taken from the stolen user database to make them appear more convincing) that could be designed to trick innocent victims into revealing more details about themselves, or clicking on dangerous links that could put their computers and their financial information at greater risk.
Thirdly, Paddy Power is at pains to point out that the incident has “no impact on customers who opened accounts after 2010”.
Now, you may think that’s good news - but dig a little deeper into the story and the truth tumbles out.
You see, Paddy Power first identified that it had been hacked back in 2010.
In its own words:
“Paddy Power had detected malicious activity in an attempted breach of its data security system in 2010. A detailed investigation was undertaken at the time and determined that no financial informa

What unconventional pairing did Katja Pettersson create for the Glass Elephant exhibition during Stockholm's design week

Sausage and bubblegum? One might think the duo would be about as successful as that classic combo of Nuts and Gum--that is to say, not at all, and an all-around terrible idea--but Katja Pettersson managed to make a perfect paring, shown as part of the Glass Elephant exhibition during Stockholm’s recent design week.
The directive for the show was to use glass as muse while exploring the unique outcomes that can occur when contrasts come together. Pettersson--one of the founding members of Swedish design group Front, who now lectures, works independently, and heads up the Fifty Fifty Projects--wanted to tackle a kind of synesthesia through design. In other words, can you sense a taste by seeing a form?
She began brainstorming by asking herself a series of questions that revolved around the materiality and basic qualities of each of her chosen component parts

amazing is the fact that it's without genre - a fusion of soul, jazz, funk, Latin, Disco, Beats rhymes and life... It's a big part of mine, and if you like the sound of the above make it part of yours.(but no, the Armand Van Helden remix of Runaway isn't on it)"
Mixing Genres and Making it Work!
M. Lee | Santa Monica, CA | 02/03/2004
(5 out of 5 stars)
"This album was quite a pleasant suprise for me. I knew very little, if nothing, about this group. I only heard "Runaway" on the radio, but I was so impressed by that song that I decided to get the album. I don't know about all you folks out there, but for me, whenever I buy an album for one good song, the rest of the album is never up to the same level as that ONE song. This album will prove the contrary. Virtually every song on the album is as good as the other. What I also love about this album is that it crosses so many different genres of music, while making it actually sound in harmony with one another! Far too often artists try to do this mixing and matching of different genres but the end results sounds so abstract and with no streamline flow to it, however Nuyorican Soul is a wonderful mix of Latin-House-R&B-Smooth Jazz-Ambient-Soul all in one! This album also has some great contributions by some classic artists, like George Benson and Roy Ayers. Be sure to check it out!!!"

Well, when one door closes another one opens they always say!
We were to start a Nancy Drew Blog Hop in January but the fabric is coming out way too late to give everyone time to make their creations so Madame Samm has put that hop off until March and in it's place has given us something fun to do instead!!
This blog hop has us including words on whatever we create, be it pieced, paper pieced, appliqued, stitched... or whatever medium we create in!! This is going to be a lot of fun and so exciting! I am going to be anxious to see what everyone creates for this hop!

What companies has Abtech Holdings partnered with to expand its oil and gas water management offerings
------------correct----------------------
Abtech Holdings Expands Oil & Gas Offering Across N. America: Validates Technology in Ten Shale Plays; Validates Cross-Linked Gel Frac Recycle Technology; Signs Four Teaming Agreements with Oil & Gas Services Companies
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., April 25, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Abtech Holdings, Inc. (OTC QB: ABHD) ("AbTech" or the "Company"), a full-service environmental technologies and engineering firm dedicated to providing innovative solutions to communities, industry and governments addressing issues of water pollution and contamination, today announced teaming agreements with four water service companies to facilitate the expansion of its oil & gas water management offering. The Company also has multiple additional teaming, licensing, and distribution agreements near final stages of completion.
Through its teaming agreements, AbTech and its teaming partners will be able to offer a full range of water treatment and management capabilities to their clients. AbTech has signed teaming agreements with:
- TETRA Technologies, Inc. – a Texas-based global, diversified oil and gas services company with employees and operations on five continents covering both onshore and offshore services. TETRA was recently named Water Management Company of the Year for the Northeast Region (Marcellus and Utica) at the Oil & Gas Awards.
- Crescent Services, LLC – an Oklahoma-based water management and environmental services company with over 700 employees and locations in eight states.
- Wastewater Solutions Unlimited, LLC – a Texas-based water treatment company with over 30 years of experience covering industrial and Oil & Gas water treatments.
- Ground/Water Treatment & Technology, Inc. – a New Jersey-based company that delivers water management and treatment services with over 17 years of experience and having treated in excess of 400 Million Barrels (16 Billion Gallons) of wastewater from hundreds of project sites throughout North America.
AbTech's Oil & Gas solutions combine best-of-breed commercial technologies, innovative systems engineering, and specialty technologies such as the Smart Sponge® de-oiling technology. The Company's Smart Sponge technology is gaining worldwide recognition as an effective tool in de-oiling applications for the Oil & Gas industry, after having validated its technology on the produced waters of ten different shale plays in the United States, including the Permian, Fayetteville, Bakken, Cana Woodford, Marcellus, Eagleford, Piceance, Frenchie Draw, and Utica shale plays. AbTech was recently named Water Management Company of the Year for the Gulf Coast region at the Oil & Gas Awards and last year's Technological Innovator of the Year at the World Shale Oil & Gas Awards.
AbTech is also announced the validation and scale-up of its cross-linked gel frac recycle unit. Cross-linked gels, one of the two main hydraulic fracturing fluid streams, include various agents to increase viscosity and otherwise improve the fracturing process. AbTech is scaling up its cross-linked gel frac recycle unit to meet the daily flowrate needs of operators particularly in liquid rich basins. AbTech recently validated its ability to remove up to 99% of key cross-link agents such as boron.
AbTech's Executive Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Business Development, Bjornulf White, stated, "We believe that AbTech's proven capabilities in complex water treatment, combined with the broader oil & gas industry-specific expertise of our teaming partners, will enable us to offer the best value to our clients, including delivery and operation of cost-effective, efficient water treatment systems to operators across the country and abroad. We have expanded our offerings to include mobile trailer-based treatment systems and fixed treatment systems for nearly any treatment need. AbTech is finding significant receptivity and interest amongst operators for our systems and have developed a strong pipeline of near term opportunities."
Commenting on the new teaming relationships and AbTech's expanded oil & gas offerings, Glenn Rink, CEO of AbTech commented, "As a solutions company with un

This week the pair peruse the London Bills of Mortality, which from the mid-17th to mid-19th century recorded burials and causes of death within the City of London. With deaths reported by parish clerks on a weekly basis, the Bills make it possible to trace the movement of the Great Plague throughout the City in 1665.
A slice of racy Victorian is next on the agenda with a look at an "indescribably filthy" 19th century journal, complete with female ankles and

“It's like a dream; I mean, it's not real. It doesn't feel real, it doesn't seem real in my body, in my mind,” he told FOX17.
Strobino, who currently works at a pharmacy, is considering continuing his education and going for his masters. He told WSMV he would like to get a job at the Department of Veterans Affairs to help fellow veterans one-on-one.
"The sky isn't even the limit. You can push past that, like there is no limit," he said.

What did Ashley's wedding dress and accessories look like
------------correct----------------------
t list, nothing rigid. They wanted everyone they loved to show up, relax, have fun, and PARTY! Ashley is a hair stylist, and altogether the most stylish person I know. I was so anxious to see what wedding gown she chose. I knew it would be simply beautiful. There were no big princess gowns for this bride! When I finally saw the dress, blue shoes, and the amazing birdcage veil I was elated! She looked so amazing. Her girlfriends who work in the beauty industry as well did her hair and make-up on their private porch that was attached to the guestroom.
So much more to come

such complex and passionate issues, it is never a bad idea to remind myself – Bruce, you are first a citizen of the Body of Christ and then a citizen of the United States of America.
When such difficult questions before us as a country, I must constantly commit to being a Christian who happens to be an American and not the other way around. For if I confuse the two, my independent American sensibilities and the pursuit of my own individual rights will too often result in just the opposite being inflicted up those whom my Christian faith calls me to love and serve. If my citizenship trumps my faith, the pursuit of my own life, liberty and happiness will lead directly and indirectly to the death, oppression and despair for the stranger, the enemy, the prisoner, the poor, the outcast, the hungry and the oppressed.
Does this mean that I want the United States to become a theocracy governed by a less than unanimous understanding of the Christian faith, of course not. And are there times when my faith and citizenship align, sure. The big takeaway for this Christian, who cherishes the opportunities to dialogue about the politics and policies of our country, is that I must be open to solutions to complex issues that might indeed infringe upon my own independence and personal gain so others may thrive. For in the end, our life does not belong to the United States of America, in life and in death, we belong to God.
Woe to me if I confuse the two

What are some of the challenges young people face regarding gender identity and sexual orientation, as described in 'How Beautiful the Ordinary'
------------correct----------------------
How Beautiful the Ordinary , edited by Michael Cart, is a welcome addition to the small but growing collection of young adult fiction exploring gender identity and sexual orientation. Being a young person is difficult, what with all the changes physical, emotional, and social. Most of us spend our whole lives getting to know ourselves, and those initial explorations in our youth are some of the most confusing and painful (and exhilarating and profound) because they are so new. All of this can be overwhelming, and when you throw in societal condemnation of some of these identities and/or lifestyles it is especially hard. This collection of short fiction by well-respected young adult authors takes a loving and unrelenting look at the struggle not only to discover what we are as young women and men, but to accept and own that identity as well.
"My Virtual World" by Francesca Lia Block chronicles the ways in which online connections can serve to safely hide or reveal one's true self. Through a series of increasingly open instant messages, two young people struggling with depression find acceptance and in turn learn to accept themselves. Ariel Schrag and Eric Shanower contribute a humorous look at gay pride events and the pangs of a secret high school love, respectively, in graphic novel format. Poetic verse (Julie Anne Peters' intimate "The First Time") and screenplay (Ron Koertge's experimental story of a gay son's coming out to his father) also add variety to the collection. One of the most powerful stories, however, uses the old folktale "The Highwayman"

An Army veteran who survived being shot 13 times while serving in Iraq was able to walk across the stage at Middle Tennessee State University on Saturday, thanks to the help from an on-campus organization.
Jay Strobino was injured in 2006, getting shot at close range and leaving the entire right side of his body riddled with bullets.
His company with the 101st Airborne Division was on a mission to grab a high-profile target when they were ambushed by enemy fighters. One militant fired at Strobino.
“He came back around and he shot me again, and right before he shot me again I was like, ‘this is it.’ That was it, all I could do was roll over and take the brunt of it again," Strobino told FOX17.

t list, nothing rigid. They wanted everyone they loved to show up, relax, have fun, and PARTY! Ashley is a hair stylist, and altogether the most stylish person I know. I was so anxious to see what wedding gown she chose. I knew it would be simply beautiful. There were no big princess gowns for this bride! When I finally saw the dress, blue shoes, and the amazing birdcage veil I was elated! She looked so amazing. Her girlfriends who work in the beauty industry as well did her hair and make-up on their private porch that was attached to the guestroom.
So much more to come

uscle to release.“The more elasticity you can create in the groin, the less likely it is to tear. You’ll even find you have more strength. A muscle that has a good range of motion and elasticity is a stronger muscle,” emphasizes Morris. “Finish with a Plié squat with the toes and knees turned out. You’re really trying to sit your bum deep into your Plié squat to find the groin stretch at the bottom of that.”
Other suggestions for your stretches:
- If you find one side is tighter, make sure you linger a little longer or “double dose” that side. For instance, if your left side is tighter, go left, right, left so it equalizes better. Your end game is to find symmetry and flexibility through the whole body.
- Find a time in the morning and/or evening when you might have a little bit of time to yourself so you can settle into your stretching more easily.
- You don’t want to protect and hold against any stretch. You want to be in a place where you’re comfortable enough that there’s a balance between intensity and ability. You want to feel able to get deep into that stretch and continue to find more depth as you go, using relaxing breath to help you get there.
- Repeat your stretch sequences in part or in sequence as often as possible.
“The more you can maintain yourself and keep yourself feeling limber and agile, the stronger you’ll feel and the less likely you’ll be injured,” Steve says, “so you can ride pain free and at the top of your game.” Sounds like this will work off the saddle too!

Report Documents Border Patrol Abuses
No More Deaths/No Mas Muertes, a group based out of Tucson, Arizona that provides humanitarian aid to migrants crossing the US/Mexico border illegally, has released a new report documenting the abuse of immigrants in the custody of the US Border Patrol.
“A Culture of Cruelty: Abuse and Impunity in Short-Term US Border Patrol Custody,” follows up on the group’s “Crossing the Line: Human Rights Abuses of Migrants in Short-Term Custody,” which was released in 2008. Over three years, No More Deaths interviewed approximately 13,000 migrants who had been detained by Border Patrol officers, claiming to document 30,000 instances of abuse. Common complaints include physical abuse, denial of medical treatment for wounds suffered during the border crossing attempt or at the hands of officers, and denial of sufficient food and water.
Specifically, 2,981 people claimed they were given no food and 11,384 said they received only items such as cracker packets or juice boxes. 80% of those in custody for more than two days did not receive a full meal during that time. 863 migrants claimed they were not allowed any access to water, even though many apprehended were suffering from dehydration.
