sed to shoot with that type of film. Today, there are limited resources in terms of projectors that can play 70mm film, let alone projectionists trained to expertly show these types of films on a regular basis.
Essentially, 35mm film did to 70mm film what digital film is currently doing to 35mm film… making it obsolete. 35mm film was more manipulable for different formats, and could be squeezed and bent more easily without distortion, unlike 70mm film.
The Digital Revolution
Traditional motion pictures are recorded on analog film frames, whereas digital film is recorded as digital video images. That is a fundamental difference that creates a very different visual experience for movie-goers who prefer “the real thing”. Digital film is captured like a digital photograph, using light sensors and digital receptors to resolve the image, but that’s only the very basic version.
High-definition video (Hi-def) has even better resolution, and this has since been followed up by 2K and 4K, creating an arms race to create the most incredibly clear and detailed movies on the market. Digital film is useful and preferred in many instances because it can be crunched down to whatever size is most convenient, without losing much resolution. For example, a new movie that is shot on digital film, rather than celluloid film, can be manipulated and shrunk to fit on the screen of a tablet or smartphone without compromising picture quality.
In a mobile, device-oriented society, this flexible capability makes it more profitable and sensible for most directors to shoot films in a digital format. Even most old movies have been re-recorded in digital formats for that same reason – ease of distribution and consumption.
One might think that with our ever-advancing digital technology, the resolution would be far better in a high-definition digital film, making the discussion of 70mm vs. digital superfluous. However, high-format celluloid films (70mm) have relatively comparable, if not better, resolution than high-definition digital films. There is also an authentic edge to old-school cinematography, which is often lost in the glossy, sterile, and polished appearance of digital projection.
While neither of these two formats can be called “better” than the other, the decision of whether to support or see a digital film vs. a 70mm film truly comes down to personal preference. For traditional film lovers, a movie shot in 70mm will always be superior to the plasticized images of a digital film, whereas superhero blockbuster fans are almost certainly digital film supporters, considering those CGI effects and epic battle scenes would likely be impossible without digital magic!

hips. But the very feelings and impulses that caused so much trouble for Thea in Florida begin to assert themselves at Yonahlossee as well.
Disclafani does a remarkable job channeling into the complex and sometimes contradictory emotions of a fifteen year old girl (Anton Discalfani is female). If you’ve read any reviews, you know that this novel involves a sexual coming of age story. It also does a fine job of situating its characters in a specific period of US history which involved great upheaval as families once wealthy became impoverished and some women yearned for more than the narrow life of marriage and family.
There are a number of strong female characters in the story. Thea is at the top of the list. For a 15 year old, she has a strong sense of purpose and desire, a fearlessness and recklessness that she embraces. Though she resents and is hurt by the separation from her family, she eventually sees that it’s the best thing that has happened to her. Mrs. Holmes, married to the camp’s headmaster, seems to see all and know all at the school, is the head disciplinarian and fundraiser. She knew Thea’s mother when they were in school together and seems to know the details of Thea’s transgressions. One of Thea’s more interesting classmates, Leona, is aloof and stoic, from a very wealthy family and a superb horsewoman. Leona and Thea share a passion for horses and have a confidence and determination that the other girls lack. Most of them aspire to a good marriage and some are forced for financial reasons to marry young.
The final resolution of the novel, where we learn exactly what happened between Thea, Sam and Georgie and its aftermath, is a little surprising. Some details can be gleaned from Thea throughout her tale, but the big reveals are saved for the end. I found this to be a well constructed novel with engaging characters and a clever plot. Another great read for summer

An endowed gift can create a new endowment or add to an existing endowment. The principal of the endowment is invested and a portion of the principal’s earnings are used each year to support our mission.
Tax on the growth in value of an asset—such as real estate or stock—since its original purchase.
Securities, real estate or any other property having a fair market value greater than its original purchase price.
Real estate can be a personal residence, vacation home, timeshare property, farm, commercial property or undeveloped land.
A charitable remainder trust provides you or other named individuals income each year for life or a period not exceeding 20 years from assets you give to the trust you create.
You give assets to a trust that pays our organization set payments for a number of years, which you choose. The longer the length of time, the better the potential tax savings to you. When the term is up, the remaining trust assets go to you, your family or other beneficiaries you select. This is an excellent way to transfer property to family members at a minimal cost.
You fund this type of trust with cash or appreciated assets—and may qualify for a federal income tax charitable deduction when you itemize. You can also make additional gifts; each one also qualifies for a tax deduction. The trust pays you, each year, a variable amount based on a fixed percentage of the fair market value of the trust assets. When the trust terminates, the remaining principal goes to Linfield as a lump sum.
You fund this trust with cash or appreciated assets—and may qualify for a federal income tax charitable deduction when you itemize. Each year the trust pays you or another named individual the same dollar amount you choose at the start. When the trust terminates, the remaining principal goes to Linfield as a lump sum.
A beneficiary designation clearly identifies how specific assets will be distributed after your death.
A charitable gift annuity involves a simple contract between you and Linfield where you agree to make a gift to Linfield and we, in return, agree to pay you (and someone else, if you choose) a fixed amount each year for the rest of your life.

------------question-----------------------
How does the military view dissenting comments and blogs in relation to engagement and credibility
------------correct----------------------
rstand how two-way and multi-way engagement becomes powerful.
- Social media is not only used to disseminate but also to engage to learn, and possibly change, leaders’ approacha and behavior.
- @pricefloyd says that having dissenting comments and points of view that do not have approval gives more credibility to the engagement.
- Military uses 3rd party sites so the world can read and interact and tell stories first hand reports from the troops.
- The approach is to encourage people throughout the military to “go out and tell their stories”. Military leaders know that those online are professionals and “will do the right thing”.
- Army leaders encourage individuals to blog on their own sites and link and cross link to the army blog site. They don’t care about negative articles or positive article, but they care that bloggers tell accurate stories.
- The military has to use both traditional and new media.
- The leaders see that criticisms are good because it means others are reading the blogs and gives something for them to learn. Negative criticisms will stay blogs unless it is overly obscene.
This conference has been one that is somewhat out of my element. It is refreshing to hear from leaders of the military who “get social media”, understand how
- conflicting opinions are ways to learn and adjust.
- personal accounts can be powerful ways to tell the military story.
- engagement leads to learning and improving
- trusting people throughout the military to do the right thing without posting strict rules is a good way to capitalize personalized stories.
- grass-roots connections build credibility and trust.
All day, I keep thinking that if the military can trust their people to do the right thing and find value in dissenting comments, why aren’t more educational institutions in-tuned to the value of learning and improving based on the freedom of engagement.

Browser trackers enable companies to collect a significant amount of data and track your online activities. You can easily become a victim of adware, which is not only intrusive but also slows down your device.
The security of your devices is also at risk, especially when shopping online or using cloud-based services.

What benefits do members of the Linfield College Founders' Society receive for making a planned gift
------------correct----------------------
Individuals who make a planned gift to Linfield, either through a bequest in a will or living trust or a remainder designation in a life-income gift, retirement plan or life insurance policy, are recognized through membership in the Linfield College Founders' Society.
The Founders' Society was created so that the college could offer its thanks during the lifetimes of the many generous individuals who make these gifts from their life's work through any of the many gift plans. The most common method of securing membership in the Founders' Society is by making Linfield a beneficiary of your estate. You don't have to be wealthy to be able to make a significant impact on the future of Linfield through an estate gift. Over the last ten years, estate gifts have provided an average of $1.6 million in annual gift revenue to Linfield. With the bulk of these gifts designated for the college's endowment, these gifts strengthen Linfield's stature as a leading, small liberal arts college for generations to come.
Founders' Society members are invited to and recognized during an annual luncheon held during Homecoming weekend in the fall, and their names are listed in Linfield's Honor Roll of Donors.
If you've already completed a gift plan that includes Linfield, but haven't yet notified anyone at the college about it, please contact Craig L. Haisch '95 at firstname.lastname@example.org or at 503-883-2675 or fill out our letter of intent form (PDF) so that we can thank you for helping strengthen the Linfield experience.

Set in the years 1930-31, while the Depression continues to take its toll on the US economy, The Yonahlossee Riding Camp for Girls tells the story of 15-year-old Thea Atwell. Thea and her twin brother Sam live a charmed life in central Florida. Their father is a doctor and their mother is a beauty who has created a lovely home for her family in the middle of nowhere. Thea and Sam are close, as twins often are, but moreso because there are no other children around. Their only other companion is their cousin Georgie, two years older and living with his parents in Gainesville. Thanks to their father’s profession as a doctor and their ownership of citrus land, the Atwells are weathering the depression fairly well. Thea owns a pony and is obsessed with riding. Sam is a born naturalist and has a gentle way with both people and animals. Georgie is their adored cousin and friend until something horrible happens and the loving family unit is ripped apart.
As the story begins, Thea’s father is taking her to North Carolina to the Yonahlossee Riding Camp for Girls. We know that the horrible thing has happened and that Thea, the narrator, has had a key role in said horrible thing. She is under the impression that she is attending the camp as punishment for a couple of months until summer is over and she can return home. Not until much later does she learn that she will be staying for the school year. As she makes her way through this year, we learn piece by piece what exactly happened back in Florida.
The school isn’t much as far as educating young women academically. It’s more of a “finishing school” where girls of wealthy families learn manners, elocution and riding. For Thea, it’s the first time she has had to be with peers, live with them and be known by others not of the family unit. Initially, she is resistant and uncomfortable, but she does grow to love the place and make close friends

What kind of impact evaluations are discussed in the monthly note series 'Evidence to Policy' that are supported by the World Bank
------------correct----------------------
Evidence to Policy, a monthly note series on learning what works, highlights studies that evaluate the impact of programs in the critical areas of human development --health, education, social protection, water and sanitation and labor. From how to best supply rural health clinics with drugs to what helps students do better in school, World Bank-supported impact evaluations provide governments and development experts with the information they need to use resources most effectively. As impact evaluations increasingly become more important to policymakers, this series offers a non-technical review of the many innovations the World Bank is supporting, and the growing number of rigorous studies analyzing the impacts of those innovations. The note series is managed by SIEF, which receives generous funding from the British government's Department for International Development and the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF).
The impact evaluation of a conditional cash transfer program targeting nutrition in young children showed good results, and now the Government of Bangladesh is scaling up the nutrition component of the program to reach more poor households.

The Philippines is successfully using conditional cash transfers to improve health and education for the poorest families, but the program hasn't been effective at raising school enrollment for older children. Based on the evaluation, the government has increased the transfer amount for older children.
In Tanzania, an innovative conditional cash transfer program that relies on local communities to administer the payments has succeeded in helping the country’s poorest citizens. As the results of a recent impact evaluation indicate, cash transfer systems can be adapted to work well in low-income countries that don’t have a strong central government to administer them.

hour on a 50 kW rapid - for the Hyundai Kona Electric 64 kWh, and under 50 minutes on rapid points for the smaller battery model.
Key added equipment includes a new safety package fitted to the Kona Electric, which sees a range of new features added to the previously already well-specified set-up. Safe Exit Warning, Rear Seat Alert, and Rear Cross Traffic Collision Avoidance Assist are some of those added to elements that had included Smart Cruise Control, Lane Keep Assist, and Driver Attention Warning.
Convenience improvements include heated rear seats, added USB ports in the rear, and five new colours, doubling the choice available. The most obvious change comes with the addition of Hyundai’s 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system, which brings with it the latest BlueLink systems and connected car features.

ropped because it is no longer supported by Debian ether.
As soon as they have synced, you can also use the the mirrors listed on http://kolab.org/mirrors.html
You can check the integrity of the downloaded files by importing our file distribution key and verify the OpenPGP signature and SHA1 checksums:
$ wget https://ssl.intevation.de/Intevation-Distribution-Key.asc
$ gpg –import Intevation-Distribution-Key.asc
$ gpg –verify SHA1SUMS.sig
$ sha1sum -c SHA1SUMS
This release marks the end of a long development cycle. After over 2 years, the master and the stable branch are (more or less) in sync again. We
introduced many new features and fixed a large number of bugs. We tested the release intensively but due to the massive code changes, we might have missed something or even introduced new bugs.
Before you use this release in a critical environment, we’d like you to test it. Please report any problems you encounter in our bug tracker: https://bugzilla.kolabsys.com/
Depending on the number and severity of bugs, we will issue an updated release soon. We already have a number of fixes in the queue such as the today’s Z-push 1.5.2 release, so Kolab 2.3.1 will come soon.
I’d like to thank a few people for their help, namely and in no particular order:
– Paul and Georg, for giving me the chance to work on a great project like Kolab
– Bernhard for his coordination
– Thomas and Sascha for their support, especially during this week
– Bogo for the awesome new look of the webadmin
– Jeroen for his input and providing me the infrastructure I need
– Gunnar for responding so fast to the issues we spotted
Without these people the Kolab Server 2.3 would not be possible. Thank everybody for your hard work!

I attended the Military Blogging conference to
- learn about military, retired military, and military support groups who use of social media
- meet people who represent groups that help military families.
A summary of my observations are:
- Military bloggers are passionate, as you would expect.
- Military bloggers who began blogging in 2002 and 2003 were leaders and drove a grass roots movement that led to identifying military bloggers in a loosely structured group, but tightly connected and networked individuals. The blog sites are aggregated on the Military Blogging web site.
- Thousands of non-profit organizations serve military, soldiers, veterans, and families.
- Throughout this community of military bloggers, they all have a sense of responsibility toward families.
- As military families engage, the expression and sharing of small frustrations is often what ties military spouses together, regardless of their location.
- Social media has enabled a community of individuals who are passionate about the military to form tight bonds of respect, admiration, trust, expectations, and influence among this community.
- Over time, these bloggers have become influential not only among their own online communities, but also in making a difference in perceptions, policy, and legislation.
- One reason for their influence is that blogging has moved to, and is encouraged, by soldiers and others to tell real stories.
- Though some of the early bloggers, started blogging anonymous, now it seems that there is not a concern of separating personal life and professional life online. In fact, telling own personal stories are encouraged.
- @pricefloyd, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, says that military needs more conversations on topics about the military. Does not mean that mistakes will not be made and that mistakes that have been made are not more harmful than other mistakes.

What key event in Thea's life leads to her attending the Yonahlossee Riding Camp for Girls
------------correct----------------------
Set in the years 1930-31, while the Depression continues to take its toll on the US economy, The Yonahlossee Riding Camp for Girls tells the story of 15-year-old Thea Atwell. Thea and her twin brother Sam live a charmed life in central Florida. Their father is a doctor and their mother is a beauty who has created a lovely home for her family in the middle of nowhere. Thea and Sam are close, as twins often are, but moreso because there are no other children around. Their only other companion is their cousin Georgie, two years older and living with his parents in Gainesville. Thanks to their father’s profession as a doctor and their ownership of citrus land, the Atwells are weathering the depression fairly well. Thea owns a pony and is obsessed with riding. Sam is a born naturalist and has a gentle way with both people and animals. Georgie is their adored cousin and friend until something horrible happens and the loving family unit is ripped apart.
As the story begins, Thea’s father is taking her to North Carolina to the Yonahlossee Riding Camp for Girls. We know that the horrible thing has happened and that Thea, the narrator, has had a key role in said horrible thing. She is under the impression that she is attending the camp as punishment for a couple of months until summer is over and she can return home. Not until much later does she learn that she will be staying for the school year. As she makes her way through this year, we learn piece by piece what exactly happened back in Florida.
The school isn’t much as far as educating young women academically. It’s more of a “finishing school” where girls of wealthy families learn manners, elocution and riding. For Thea, it’s the first time she has had to be with peers, live with them and be known by others not of the family unit. Initially, she is resistant and uncomfortable, but she does grow to love the place and make close friends

Thomas made his first short film at the age of 16 and was admitted three years later to the National Film School of Denmark, thus becoming their youngest student ever. He graduated in 1993 with his short Last Round garnering a nomination for a Student Academy Award. He was catapulted to international fame in 1998 when his second feature, Festen, received the Jury Prize in Cannes, as the first film completed under the terms of the Dogme 95 Manifesto, of which he had been co-author alongside Lars von Trier.
In an interview taken on October 14 at Filmmakers Afternoon Tea, Mayfair Hotel, London, as part of the 2012 LONDON FILM FESTIVAL, Thomas reminisces about the “innocent days” of his first shorts:
Dana:”What is your relationship with the short form and how did you find the transition from making shorts to making features?”
Thomas: “I made three shorts before starting making features and I find that form very powerful. Unfortunately the weak point is the distribution, nobody sees them, which is why it is dying somehow, or at least it dies in the career, it doesn’t die in the world…But I find it as difficult and as powerful as a feature, maybe they’ll come back, I don’t know, it seems that things are getting longer, it’s the TV series now, which I also find very interesting. But I miss the days of the short film.
Dana: “Well, you never know, you might make another short one day…”
Thomas: “Yes definitely, and I’m also thinking maybe the best film I’ve done so far is a short…”
Dana: “Which one is this?”
Thomas: “My graduate film, The Last Round.
Thomas: Then I did another one produced by Nimbus and called The Boy Who Walked Backwards. To make good short film you have to be incredibly smart, as it is much more difficult to achieve the same dramatic effect in a much shorter span of time. Also there is an innocence, a purity about my short films which I lost since I started making features, and I’m attracted to purity. The short film can be so powerful, it’s a sort of no-nonsense form of the feature, so I like it…
Dana: “Any tips for filmmakers who make the transition from short to feature?”
Thomas: “Well, I’ve made so many mistakes, so how could I do tips? But what I think is interesting for me is, don’t follow the ideas that seem rational and right, the idea where you say to your friends “This is crazy” and your friends say “Ah, we can’t do that”, this is the one you should do (laughter).
Thomas Vinterberg introducing his new film The Hunt at 2012 LONDON FILM FESTIVAL
Thomas: “The Hunt is about a small innocent society/village somewhere in the forest, with good-hearted people, lots of togetherness rituals, a hunting society and this man, male character who works in a kindergarten. One of the girls in the kindergarten is a very close friend’s daughter and slightly falls in love with him, in a non-sexual kind of way, of course, and he’s rejecting her a little bit, she gets angry and lies about it. It’s a sexual lie and a witch hunt begins. And he is ostracised from this society and hell breaks loose, orange turns blue and black. And I made a film years ago called Festen, this is sort of the anti-thesis to that movie, a mirror. So that is the movie. For me it is primarily a film about friendship, love, forgiveness, and primarily maybe loss of innocence. There’s all sorts of naked jumping into the river at the beginning, and there’s also fearful, hostile people”.
Dana: “It is a very challenging topic, and you are known for choosing very difficult, very controversial topics, what is your method of dealing with a subject like that, how do you handle it?”
Thomas: “It is also very dramatic, and it is true to say it was very difficult but also very fruitful as a writer to sit with, because there is a conflict and you can bring people and you can undress the characters through conflict. As a filmmaker, and I have made 20 films in my life.. I wanted to make it about something of importance, not morally speaking, not as a priest, but it has to be something…and I really felt that there was something in this, which made it a very uplifting process, a very joyful ride…”
Dana: “What is it like working with Mads Mikkelsen?”
Thomas:”Well, the first thing that hits you is that he is so strikingly beautiful, so that hurts a little, I wanted to dress his down and destroy his good looks, but then you learn that he’s such a friendly, giving, heroic team-player, he’s a huge enthusiast and very good, extremely good…I changed the character for him because he was more of a hero, strong man, man of few words, Robert de Niro kind of character in the script…and you notice when you see the film that we made him softer, we made him a school teacher, very humble, wearing glasses, and weak somehow, almost Christian, very forgiving, very patient…”
Dana: “Did he want that?”
Thomas: “No, I wanted that, and he agreed on that as we were both inspired by that idea…I initially wrote it for Robert de Niro then Mads came on board and then I rewrote it for him. I always write for specific actors, also if they’re dead or something, there has to be someone…and Mads does not attach to any project without a script, so I couldn’t write for him, until he was a

How does maternal stress during pregnancy affect the intestinal microbiota of infants according to the study from Radboud University Nijmegen

use. Family life also serves as a source of resilience in the face of chronic stress. Thus, warm, nurturing families tend to promote resistance to stress and to diminish vulnerability to stress-induced illness. The epidemiology of affective disorders reflects the profound influence of family life on neural development and mental health.
Early Social Environment
The relationship between the quality of the early social environment and health in adulthood appears to be, in part, mediated by the development of individual differences in neural systems that underlie the expression of behavioral and endocrine responses to stress.
Thus, physical and sexual abuse in early life increases endocrine and autonomic responses to stress in adulthood. Likewise, variations in parental care associate with individual differences in neuroendocrine and autonomic responses to stress in humans as well as emotional reactivity. Finally, there is considerable evidence in favor of the hypothesis that individual differences in stress reactivity predict the risk for depression
Thus, the influence of familial depressive illness is, in part at least, mediated by increased stress reactivity, enhancing the response of the individual to mild, regular stressors (ie, hassles). Individuals with early adverse experience appear to be sensitized to the depressive effects of acute stress in adulthood.
We have all felt it – stress. Sometimes it is a powerful ally that helps us perform better in an exam or when giving a talk. But when it turns into a long-lasting partner, it can become a serious health problem that may even interfere with our ability to live a normal life. Furthermore, stress is a key issue in certain periods of our life, such as pregnancy.
A number of scientific studies have already linked stress in pregnant women to premature birth, low birth weight, some skin conditions, asthma and even anxiety and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the reasons underlying these associations remain elusive. So what if gut microbiota played a role?
A new study by researchers from the Behavioural Science Institute of Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands, published in the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology, appears to shed some light on this link between stress in pregnant women and their babies’ microbiota.
According to the authors of the study, mothers who experience high and prolonged levels of stress during gestation are more likely to have infants with more probabilities of suffering intestinal problems and allergic reactions.
The scientists recruited 56 pregnant mothers and measured women’s levels of stress by asking them to complete a questionnaire and to provide a saliva sample in which they analysed the concentrations of cortisol (the so-called stress hormone) prior to delivery. The Dutch researchers subsequently examined the microbiota of the babies’ guts through stool samples collected from the age of 7 days up until 4 months after birth.
According to this team of experts, there is a correlation between highly stressed pregnant mothers and the composition of microbes in the newborns’ guts. These infants had a significantly higher relative abundance of Proteobacterial groups, known, in the author’s words, to contain pathogens (Escherichia, Serratia and Enterobacter), and lower quantities of lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Aerococcus and Bifidobacteria.
Altogether, experts consider this pattern to be related to a potentially increased level of inflammation. This aberrant colonization pattern was related to more maternally reported infant gastrointestinal symptoms and allergic reactions. They also saw that breastfeeding, which is known to promote the development of beneficial microbes in the intestine due to the prebiotic content of breast milk, was not enough to protect the baby from the negative effects of its mother’s stress.
Although it remains a theory, researchers speculate that the cortisol may be interfering with bile production, which could, in turn, influence gut bacteria. They also highlight this stress hormone may be able to pass through the placenta and increase cortisol levels in the foetus, thus affecting the development of the gastrointestinal tract.
According to the authors of the paper, the study has shown clear links between the mother’s stress during pregnancy and the baby’s gut microbiota development and health. For these Dutch experts, the results suggest there is a possible mechanism by which maternal prenatal stress influences the development of the foetus.
Nevertheless, the reasons behind this link are still unknown and require further research. Finally, researchers from Radboud University Nijmegen consider their findings may open up a potential way for bacterial interventions to improve health and development in babies born to stressed mothers.

Only in this age-group, the ``PISA-age'', informatics is a compulsory subject. The implementation of additional IT/informatics classes at lower secondary level is exclusively the result of autonomous decisions in schools. Recently, a web-based nationwide online research has been conducted. In this paper some preliminary results are presented.

------------question-----------------------
What are Thomas Vinterberg's thoughts on the difference between making short films and feature films
------------correct----------------------
Thomas made his first short film at the age of 16 and was admitted three years later to the National Film School of Denmark, thus becoming their youngest student ever. He graduated in 1993 with his short Last Round garnering a nomination for a Student Academy Award. He was catapulted to international fame in 1998 when his second feature, Festen, received the Jury Prize in Cannes, as the first film completed under the terms of the Dogme 95 Manifesto, of which he had been co-author alongside Lars von Trier.
In an interview taken on October 14 at Filmmakers Afternoon Tea, Mayfair Hotel, London, as part of the 2012 LONDON FILM FESTIVAL, Thomas reminisces about the “innocent days” of his first shorts:
Dana:”What is your relationship with the short form and how did you find the transition from making shorts to making features?”
Thomas: “I made three shorts before starting making features and I find that form very powerful. Unfortunately the weak point is the distribution, nobody sees them, which is why it is dying somehow, or at least it dies in the career, it doesn’t die in the world…But I find it as difficult and as powerful as a feature, maybe they’ll come back, I don’t know, it seems that things are getting longer, it’s the TV series now, which I also find very interesting. But I miss the days of the short film.
Dana: “Well, you never know, you might make another short one day…”
Thomas: “Yes definitely, and I’m also thinking maybe the best film I’ve done so far is a short…”
Dana: “Which one is this?”
Thomas: “My graduate film, The Last Round.
Thomas: Then I did another one produced by Nimbus and called The Boy Who Walked Backwards. To make good short film you have to be incredibly smart, as it is much more difficult to achieve the same dramatic effect in a much shorter span of time. Also there is an innocence, a purity about my short films which I lost since I started making features, and I’m attracted to purity. The short film can be so powerful, it’s a sort of no-nonsense form of the feature, so I like it…
Dana: “Any tips for filmmakers who make the transition from short to feature?”
Thomas: “Well, I’ve made so many mistakes, so how could I do tips? But what I think is interesting for me is, don’t follow the ideas that seem rational and right, the idea where you say to your friends “This is crazy” and your friends say “Ah, we can’t do that”, this is the one you should do (laughter).
Thomas Vinterberg introducing his new film The Hunt at 2012 LONDON FILM FESTIVAL
Thomas: “The Hunt is about a small innocent society/village somewhere in the forest, with good-hearted people, lots of togetherness rituals, a hunting society and this man, male character who works in a kindergarten. One of the girls in the kindergarten is a very close friend’s daughter and slightly falls in love with him, in a non-sexual kind of way, of course, and he’s rejecting her a little bit, she gets angry and lies about it. It’s a sexual lie and a witch hunt begins. And he is ostracised from this society and hell breaks loose, orange turns blue and black. And I made a film years ago called Festen, this is sort of the anti-thesis to that movie, a mirror. So that is the movie. For me it is primarily a film about friendship, love, forgiveness, and primarily maybe loss of innocence. There’s all sorts of naked jumping into the river at the beginning, and there’s also fearful, hostile people”.
Dana: “It is a very challenging topic, and you are known for choosing very difficult, very controversial topics, what is your method of dealing with a subject like that, how do you handle it?”
Thomas: “It is also very dramatic, and it is true to say it was very difficult but also very fruitful as a writer to sit with, because there is a conflict and you can bring people and you can undress the characters through conflict. As a filmmaker, and I have made 20 films in my life.. I wanted to make it about something of importance, not morally speaking, not as a priest, but it has to be something…and I really felt that there was something in this, which made it a very uplifting process, a very joyful ride…”
Dana: “What is it like working with Mads Mikkelsen?”
Thomas:”Well, the first thing that hits you is that he is so strikingly beautiful, so that hurts a little, I wanted to dress his down and destroy his good looks, but then you learn that he’s such a friendly, giving, heroic team-player, he’s a huge enthusiast and very good, extremely good…I changed the character for him because he was more of a hero, strong man, man of few words, Robert de Niro kind of character in the script…and you notice when you see the film that we made him softer, we made him a school teacher, very humble, wearing glasses, and weak somehow, almost Christian, very forgiving, very patient…”
Dana: “Did he want that?”
Thomas: “No, I wanted that, and he agreed on that as we were both inspired by that idea…I initially wrote it for Robert de Niro then Mads came on board and then I rewrote it for him. I always write for specific actors, also if they’re dead or something, there has to be someone…and Mads does not attach to any project without a script, so I couldn’t write for him, until he was a

------------answer-----------------------
was a man like that. He believed in assurance. He preached doctrine, he preached messages on the doctrine of assurance, but he also believed that it was theoretically possible for a man to lose his salvation. Mr. Wesley said, “That so far as he was concerned, he didn’t think he would lose his,” but he thought it was theoretically possible for some to lose their salvation. So it’s possible for a person to believe in assurance of salvation, and not believe in the certainty of ultimate salvation.
So let’s think about the doctrine of security, and one of the greatest of all of the passages on the doctrine of the security of the believer is in this same Gospel of John. So let’s turn over to chapter 10, verse 22 through verse 30. John 10: 22 through 30. Now, I think I’ll just read along here a few verses, since we have a little bit of time. I’ll begin reading at verse 22.
“Then came the feast of dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter. And Jesus was in the Temple area, walking in Solomon’s colonnade. The Jews gathered around him saying, ‘how long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.’ Jesus answered, ‘I did tell you, but you do not believe. The miracles I do in my Father’s name speak for me. But you do not believe, because you are not my sheep.’”
Notice that statement. “You do not believe, because you are not my sheep.” How about that? “You do not believe, because you are not my sheep.” If sheep do believe, those who don’t believe, don’t believe because they’re not his sheep. Sounds like he believes in election, doesn’t it? “My sheep listen to my voice.” Notice that. “My sheep listen to my voice.” Evidently, all the sheep of the Lord Jesus hear his voice. Those who don’t hear it are not his sheep. How about that? “I know them, and they follow me. My sheep hear my voice, and they follow me.” The sheep hear the voice of the shepherd, recognize it, and they follow him. There is the inevitable change of life. They follow him. Now, they may wander off, and the shepherd may have to go out, and go and pull them out of the briars, and they may fall in the ditch, and he may have to pull them up. And they may break an arm or a leg and he may have to carry them in, but nevertheless, they do try to follow. And he says.
“I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish. No one can snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all. No one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one.”
This is one of the great passages on sovereign grace in the New Testament. God is the sculptor of the spiritual life from the beginning to the end, so that for man, nothing remains in which to boast since it is all of God. Now, if there is a passage that demolishes synergism, it is this.
Now, I think, since we have a few moments, I’m going to just put the word “synergism” here on the overhead and let you take a good look at it because it is one of the words that you should be familiar with. S-Y-N-E-R-G-I-S-M. Now, let me just say just a word about what it means. The Greek word sun is the word that means “with” and “synergism,” this “ergism” is from a Greek word that means “to work.” Ergon so mi. Ergon means “a work.” So “synergism” means a “working together,” a “doing together.”
Now, synergism is particular theological idea. It is the idea that salvation is a work of God and a work of man. Synergism. Synergism, therefore, represents the legalistic heresy. Let me read you a brief statement from one of the theological dictionaries on synergism. The Greek words mean or Greek word means “working together with.” The doctrine such as that of Philip Melancthon, who followed the Lutheran Church; that the human will has a part to play along with the Holy Spirit or the grace of God in the process of salvation. So synergism is any kind of doctrine which sets forth the way of salvation as being both a work of God and a work of man.
Now, the most deceptive form of synergism is, of course, the doctrine of the semi-Pelagians. Pelagius just said, “A man may get to heaven will apart from divine grace. He may of himself reach heaven. He may by the activity of his human will believe and be saved.” Now, in the case, of course, Pelagius’ doctrine was a doctrine that the Church rejected. Semi-Pelagian, Pelagianism arose afterwards, and semi-Pelagianism laid stress on the fact that men had free will and as a decision of the free will was that which brought divine grace, which resulted in their salvation. Synergism.
Now, Augustine and Pelagius fought out the question of synergism in human salvation, and Augustine’s doctrine won out for a time in the Roman Catholic Church. Augustine’s doctrine was “monergism.” Now, monorgism comes from the same root; “ergism” which is from the word “work,” but monos in Greek means “below.” So monergism is that salvation is a work entirely of God. Synergism; that man and God cooperate in the work of salvation, and historically, those who believe that salvation is the work of a decision of the free will, plus what Christ did on the Cross, that is synergism. The Christian church, from Augustine through the Reformers and the Lutherans, regarded this as heretical teaching because it is a denial of grace that salvation is altogether of God. So monergism is the teaching of the Bible. That is what is meant when, for example, Jonah says, “Salvation is of the Lord,” not of the Lord and man, but of the Lord. So monergism.
Arminianism also has stressed man’s freedom, either to accept or to reject the regenerating grace of God in Christ, and in the event that man accepts it, sufficient grace is given to all men, and if they accept it as the decision of their free will then God gives them salvation. Arminianism is, therefore, synergistic in its doctrine of salvation. Now, we want to stress the fact that Arminianism is, of course, the doctrine of many men who are Christians, because their thoughts are confused. They will say, “We are saved by the grace of God” in one breath, and then they will say, “We must make a decision of our free will.” Now, those things are contradictory, but Arminians frequently do not see the contradiction. We’ll give them the benefit of the doubt; say, “Yes, they are good Christians, they’re just confused Christians.”
Now, if we look at our own Christian experience, we’ve been confused about things too, haven’t we? Most of us have advanced through some confusion, and some of us, a lot of confusion into the clarity with which we see the gospel, and the truths of the Bible today, and we hope that we will advance through whatever remaining confusions that we may have to even greater clarity. That’s why we’re here. But synergism is demolished by the grace of God, and if we believe, for example, that a person is saved by the grace of God but we believe that he can fall away by the works that he may do thereafter, he is in effect saying, that he’s saved by what Christ did, plus what he continues to do, and thus, his doctrine of salvation becomes synergistic. The true believer cannot fall away from salvation, either totally or finally. He is saved eternally.
Now with that in mind, look at these statements that the Lord makes. Here in John chapter 10 in verse 27, he says, “My sheep listen to my voice. I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life.” Now notice he does not say, “I give them six months life.” He does not say, “I give them one year’s life.” He does not say, “I give them life until they commit mortal sin” but “I give them eternal life.” Now that in itself teaches that the life that we have is a life that goes on and on. Notice it is “given.” It’s not “earned.” We don’t cooperate to earn it. It is a monergistic doctrine. “I give them eternal life.” Furthermore, to emphasize the fact that that eternal life is eternal he says, “And they shall never perish.”
Now in the Greek, that’s the strongest way to express a negative prohibition. “I give unto them eternal life,

NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport added a re-signing of veteran Chris Johnson could be a potential addition to the running back room. Arians also said Johnson is an option.
Reports after the Cardinals’ 35-23 loss indicated a wide range of timelines following Johnson’s injury, which was reported to be a sprained wrist. Rapoport reported there was no break, but Chris Mortensen added that a team source believed Johnson could miss “a few weeks” to “half the season or more.”
Johnson rushed for 23 yards on 11 carries and added six receptions for 68 yards before he left the game late in the third quarter.
The third-year back was injured on a play that led to a lost fumble.

ttached…it was very complicated”.
Dana: “And what is it about him that made you think he would be particularly great for this role?”
Thomas: “Well, actually, there’s something very truthful in his acting, he’s very very realistic…besides from all the clichés that the camera really wants to look at him, he’s got a huge commercial potential and there’s also something very real about him. And I was curious to work with him, we’d worked in the same community for so many years without working together. And truthfulness is important in a film about lies, I guess basically the film’s theme is about how lies can spread, therefore everything was about making it as “naked” and as truthful as possible, and Mads completely fits into that, he’s born out of the 70’s attempt to make films in the street, American, Scorsese movies from the seventies when realism was reborn.
Dana: “And the little girl, it’s her big screen debut, how did you find shooting the more difficult scenes with her given her age?”
Thomas: “She was wonderful, there’s this child and…normally we say that working with animals and children is something you should avoid. In this case it was the other way around: the dog and the girl were just spot-on…And she was just incredibly good…And Mads and the other actors were, of course with a smile on their face, were almost intimidated by her…’cause she was just wiping the floor with them, every time, it’s incredible. We had a discussion whether to tell her about these matters or not, and of course she doesn’t understand sexuality, and should not, but we told her everything else. ‘Cause listen, we spit in her face and she was thrown around, she needs to know why…And this film is also a revolt against the over-protection and victimisation of children, so we thought, let’s talk to her like to an adult. And of course we agreed with the parents first, and it worked, she didn’t care, she was like, “ok fine, let’s shoot”, and then she did her ping-pong!
Dana: “A very precocious girl”.
Thomas: “A very healthy girl. She was very good but she’s not going to do it again.”
Dana: “About the directing process, David Mamet says that it’s all about where to put the camera and what to tell the actors, would you agree? And do you have a certain method?”
Thomas: “I think that would be pushing it. I have a method, yes. If this is my movie, and this is where the actors have some dialogue, together with the actors, and the writer, I’m creating a big movie around them all. We talk a lot about the past, and not only about the immediate past, like what are you coming with, in the room, did you just come from a fight, or from having sex, or…But what do they have together, rituals, what do they hide from each other, what are their dreams for the future, their plans. So what I always do is to work very hard and thoroughly with the actors, dialogue and rehearsals, and with the writer before we start shooting. And then we let go, to all the irrationalities, then we’re being charlatans. Because, hopefully by that time, we have solid ground to be standing on….if you can call that a method, that’s my method…and my actors seem to turn the way they want to, which is different from David Mamet. His method works very well though…”
Dana: “There’s an interrogation scene in the movie, with the little girl, where they quite literally put the words in her mouth, and I’ve read somewhere that this was based on a real transcript, can you tell me a bit about that?
Thomas: “Yes, it’s a police transcript, I’m not going to say which nationality because I don’t want to point fingers, I didn’t even want to point fingers at the police, but it’s from the 90’s, late 90s and they have improved, or at least they tried to improve…so I changed the scene to be some kind of interrogator, and I also took out a lot of very very ugly stuff, it was much much worse, and in all the cases it was much worse. You wouldn’t believe how much people put in children’s minds, how leaning the questions are…because they anticipate that the child…who wants to escape from it, because it is very unpleasant, therefore they sort of insist on this, and through that they implant false memories and they’ve done that in many many many cases. And I think that police is not doing a lot of that but the parents and a lot of kindergarten workers, they don’t know shit about this, they don’t know what to do, so they ask the same question to this poor child, and it becomes part of this child’s fantasy, and to satisfy the grownups they start inventing stuff…and again they end up as the victims, ‘cause they grow up to believe it, they grow up with the memory of having been assaulted without having been assaulted…so they grow up with a similar problem, similar needs, and they are violated by the overprotection, the fearfulness of our society…but in my film she appears to be a she-devil in people’s minds, which is not intended, because she was so nice, and she’s in love with him, so it’s an innocent love..and who wouldn’t be in love with Mads Mikkelsen?”

------------question-----------------------
What is meant by the doctrine of affirmation regarding assurance, security, and perseverance in John’s thought
------------correct----------------------
Dr. S. Lewis Johnson continues his discussion of the Reformed doctrines set forth in the Apostle John's gospel.
[Message] The subject for tonight in our continuation of the study of Johannine thought is “Assurance, Security and Perseverance.” We’re dealing again with some of the aspects of the doctrine of soteriology in John’s thought, and I’m going to begin with a few words by way of introduction.
The doctrines of assurance, security, and perseverance have never been very popular doctrines. They are popular to us in Believers Chapel because most of us believe them, but they have never really been popular doctrines. The popular language is the language of doubt. We surmise. We suppose. We may, therefore, assume. It is probably true, et cetera. In fact, the Church herself has historically never been widely known for creating a sense of certainty among her adherents. A believer’s assurance of pardon of his sins, the Council of Trent affirmed, is a vain and ungodly confidence. So there is a great tradition in the Christian Church for doubt over many of the doctrines of the faith.
Cardinal Bellermein, the champion of Roman Catholicism and its defense, called the doctrine of assurance “a prime error of the heretics.” In this, he was not following Rome’s greatest theologian, for Augustine said, “To be assured of our salvation is no arrogant stoutness. It is our faith. It is no pride. It is devotion. It is no presumption. It is God’s promise.”
What do we mean by the terms, “assurance, security and perseverance?” Well, when we talk about the doctrine of the assurance of salvation, we generally mean assurance is the doctrine that affirms that the believer may have the certainty of salvation now. So assurance is the certainty that we are saved at the present moment. The doctrine of security is the doctrine that affirms that the believer may have the certainty of salvation not only now but also forever. That’s really the doctrine of the eternity of the spiritual life. In fact, it probably would have been better if the Christian Church had spoken not of eternal security but the eternity of the spiritual life or the question of the continuity of the life is really the issue. “Continuity,” one of the contemporary theologians has said, “is the central problem of those problems which must engage us.” Eternal security, furthermore, is not a biblical term, and since it’s not a biblical term, there are always certain people who are inclined to say, “Well, it’s not found in the Bible itself, the term eternal security so, therefore, I have some question about it being a biblical doctrine.”
Now, that’s a foolish attitude, of course, because there are so many things that are not found in the Bible precisely; that is, the very terms, but the truth is taught there; that it’s, I say, foolish to make statements like that but, nevertheless, people still make them. There is, as we all know, no mention of Trinity in the Bible, but if there is one doctrine that under girds it all, it is the doctrine of the Trinity: The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; the three persons of the godhead, and yet one God who subsists in these persons. There is nothing in the Bible specifically about the old nature and the new nature, and again, there is no specific statement that says, “eternal security.” So it probably would have been better, for the sake of people who have a weakness about that, to talk about the doctrine of “eternal life.” If we called it the doctrine of eternal life, we would be saying the same thing, or the doctrine of the “eternity of the spiritual life”. That would be all right too.
So assurance is the certainty of salvation now. Security is the certainty of salvation both now and forever. What is the doctrine of perseverance? People speak of perseverance a great deal. Well, that’s the human side of eternal security. He secures and preserves us, and we, therefore, persevere. Even Spurgeon, who was a complete Calvinist, used to say that, “He thought it was more scriptural to speak of the perseverance of the Savior than of the saints. It is, strictly speaking not man, but God who perseveres.” So when we talk about the perseverance of the saints, well, we’re talking about something that is biblical but, nevertheless, it probably would be wiser to speak about the perseverance of God or, at least, to make it plain that it is God who perseveres. This is the human side of the doctrine of eternal security.
Now, sometimes the doctrine of perseverance is misunderstood and I’d like to make even plainer what is meant by the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints. The doctrine of the perseverance of the saints is not simply the doctrine that the elect will be saved in the end, but rather that the elect, once converted, never fall from their salvation and will be saved to the end. Now I say that because there are those who believe that it is possible to be saved and lost and even possible for the elect to be saved and lost, but they will surely be saved again. Lutherans, for example, believe that men may lose their salvation. They do not believe, however, that the elect may lose their salvation ultimately, but they may pass through the experience of being saved and lost, and saved and lost, and some lost forever. But the elect may be saved and lost, but they will be saved ultimately.
Now, the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints is not merely to the effect that the elect will certainly be saved in the end, but also that they can never fall from the life the eternal life that they have when they believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. They may have fallen to sin upon occasion but they will not fall from their salvation. And, furthermore, it is probably true to say that the doctrine of perseverance also teaches that the life that we obtain through regeneration, and the habits of it, will never entirely disappear from the experience of the Christian. In other words, there has to be some evidence that we have passed from death into life. It’s possible that no one ever sees that. It’s possible that a man has truly believed in Jesus Christ, and we do not see any of the effects of that, but they must be there because the change of life will manifest itself. Only God may see it. He may see it in some changed attitudes towards the saints or towards the Bible or saints may do things of which we don’t have knowledge.
So when we say that a person is a saint and say he will persevere in the faith, we mean he will not apostatize from the faith. He will be preserved by the Lord to the end as a saved individual. And we also mean that he has had a change of life; a definite change of life and those habits that appear from the work of the Spirit in sanctification, can never entirely disappear from him. To put it simply, as one of the leading theologians has put it, “Perseverance is that continuous operation of the Holy Spirit in the believer, by which the work of divine grace that is begun in the heart, is continued, and brought to completion.” So assurance, the certainty of salvation now; eternal security, the certainty of salvation now and forever; perseverance, the human side of eternal security, and perseverance is the truth that the believer will certainly be saved in the end. He will not fall from his salvation once he possesses it, and there will be a distinct change in his life as a result of his conversion.
Well now, let’s look at assurance first and in the outline, in case you are keeping outlines of the studies in Johannine theology, in my notes this is Roman I: Assurance, and John 3:31 through 36. So turn with me to the 3rd chapter of the Gospel of John, and let me read beginning at verse 31 through verse 36. Now, I’m reading tonight from the New International Version. My Authorized Version is about to fall to pieces, and that lady wrote from Saint Lucia that she wanted a Bible and three or four people in the congregation have already gotten ready to send her a Bible. She touched the hearts of

What is a charitable remainder trust and how does it provide income
------------correct----------------------
robate court proceedings and can also reduce federal estate taxes.
cannot be changed or cancelled
tax on gifts generally paid by the person making the gift rather than the recipient
the original value of an asset, such as stock, before its appreciation or depreciation
the growth in value of an asset like stock or real estate since the original purchase
the price a willing buyer and willing seller can agree on
The person receiving the gift annuity payments.
the part of an estate left after debts, taxes and specific bequests have been paid
a written and properly witnessed legal change to a will
the person named in a will to manage the estate, collect the property, pay any debt, and distribute property according to the will
A donor advised fund is an account that you set up but which is managed by a nonprofit organization. You contribute to the account, which grows tax-free. You can recommend how much (and how often) you want to distribute money from that fund to Linfield or other charities. You cannot direct the gifts.
An endowed gift can create a new endowment or add to an existing endowment. The principal of the endowment is invested and a portion of the principal’s earnings are used each year to support our mission.
Tax on the growth in value of an asset—such as real estate or stock—since its original purchase.
Securities, real estate or any other property having a fair market value greater than its original purchase price.
Real estate can be a personal residence, vacation home, timeshare property, farm, commercial property or undeveloped land.
A charitable remainder trust provides you or other named individuals income each year for life or a period not exceeding 20 years from assets you give to the trust you create.
You give assets to a trust that pays our organization set payments for a number of years, which you choose. The longer the length of time, the better the potential tax savings to you. When the term is up, the remaining trust assets go to you, your family or other beneficiaries you select. This is an excellent way to transfer property to family members at a minimal cost.
You fund this type of trust with cash or appreciated assets—and may qualify for a federal income tax charitable deduction when you itemize. You can also make additional gifts; each one also qualifies for a tax deduction. The trust pays you, each year, a variable amount based on a fixed percentage of the fair market value of the trust assets. When the trust terminates, the remaining principal goes to Linfield as a lump sum.
You fund this trust with cash or appreciated assets—and may qualify for a federal income tax charitable deduction when you itemize. Each year the trust pays you or another named individual the same dollar amount you choose at the start. When the trust terminates, the remaining principal goes to Linfield as a lump sum.
A beneficiary designation clearly identifies how specific assets will be distributed after your death.
A charitable gift annuity involves a simple contract between you and Linfield where you agree to make a gift to Linfield and we, in return, agree to pay you (and someone else, if you choose) a fixed amount each year for the rest of your life.

d by these effects, while adults seem to be more able to fight, but in adults who work in fields where chlorpyrifos is used, studies have indicated higher rates of lung cancer and respiratory issues.
Even after this SAP forced the EPA to review its findings, the EPA still declared chlorpyrifos to be excessively dangerous.
There are environmental effects, too. Chlorpyrifos is known to be toxic to aquatic animals, like shrimp. Additionally,evidence indicates that it’s toxic to bees as well, though research is ongoing into specifically how the residue of the pesticide affects them.
Just How Common Is This Stuff, Though?
Ha. Well, it’s one of the most popular pesticides in the country. According to The Intercept, about 44,000 farms use a total of 6 to 10 million pounds of chlorpyrifos-containing pesticides each year. It was registered in 1965, and organophosphates (the category including chlorpyrifos) came into popularity after the ban on DDT in 1972.
So How Can Pruitt Explain His Decision?
Pruitt, in his official statement, claimed that the EPA’s findings are unreliable. “The USDA disagrees with the methodology used by the previous Administration,” reads the statement. “The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) also expressed concerns with regard to EPA’s previous reliance on certain data the Agency had used to support its proposal to ban the pesticide.”
This is confusing! What the heck is FIFRA SAP?
Scientific Advisory Panels (SAPs) are independent groups of people who can compel the USDA to review some of its work. In theory, this stops governmental science from being too insular, but in practice…well, just for example, this SAP that “expressed concerns” to the EPA hosted not one but four people testifying “on behalf of Dow Agrochemicals,” as well as someone from CropLife America (a lobbying group for the pesticide industry), a scientist from Syngenta, and a guy who makes his living by operating the planes used to spray pesticides. (That’s in addition to a whole mess of scientists and doctors and farmers and anti-pesticide people.)
It’s important to have differing viewpoints, but testimony from people who have an immediate financial connection to a product up for review seems…questionable. That said, the panel itself is made up of scientists, doctors, and researchers associated with universities; Dow is not allowed a vote, but they are allowed to take a giant chunk of time to try to get the panel on their side.
And it’s worth noting that even after this SAP forced the EPA to review its findings, the EPA still declared chlorpyrifos to be excessively dangerous.
What Happens Now?
Nothing. Chlorpyrifos will continue to be used unless Pruitt allows the EPA to review the pesticide sometime before 2022

What does Thomas Vinterberg reveal about the challenges of directing scenes involving a child actress in the film
------------correct----------------------
ttached…it was very complicated”.
Dana: “And what is it about him that made you think he would be particularly great for this role?”
Thomas: “Well, actually, there’s something very truthful in his acting, he’s very very realistic…besides from all the clichés that the camera really wants to look at him, he’s got a huge commercial potential and there’s also something very real about him. And I was curious to work with him, we’d worked in the same community for so many years without working together. And truthfulness is important in a film about lies, I guess basically the film’s theme is about how lies can spread, therefore everything was about making it as “naked” and as truthful as possible, and Mads completely fits into that, he’s born out of the 70’s attempt to make films in the street, American, Scorsese movies from the seventies when realism was reborn.
Dana: “And the little girl, it’s her big screen debut, how did you find shooting the more difficult scenes with her given her age?”
Thomas: “She was wonderful, there’s this child and…normally we say that working with animals and children is something you should avoid. In this case it was the other way around: the dog and the girl were just spot-on…And she was just incredibly good…And Mads and the other actors were, of course with a smile on their face, were almost intimidated by her…’cause she was just wiping the floor with them, every time, it’s incredible. We had a discussion whether to tell her about these matters or not, and of course she doesn’t understand sexuality, and should not, but we told her everything else. ‘Cause listen, we spit in her face and she was thrown around, she needs to know why…And this film is also a revolt against the over-protection and victimisation of children, so we thought, let’s talk to her like to an adult. And of course we agreed with the parents first, and it worked, she didn’t care, she was like, “ok fine, let’s shoot”, and then she did her ping-pong!
Dana: “A very precocious girl”.
Thomas: “A very healthy girl. She was very good but she’s not going to do it again.”
Dana: “About the directing process, David Mamet says that it’s all about where to put the camera and what to tell the actors, would you agree? And do you have a certain method?”
Thomas: “I think that would be pushing it. I have a method, yes. If this is my movie, and this is where the actors have some dialogue, together with the actors, and the writer, I’m creating a big movie around them all. We talk a lot about the past, and not only about the immediate past, like what are you coming with, in the room, did you just come from a fight, or from having sex, or…But what do they have together, rituals, what do they hide from each other, what are their dreams for the future, their plans. So what I always do is to work very hard and thoroughly with the actors, dialogue and rehearsals, and with the writer before we start shooting. And then we let go, to all the irrationalities, then we’re being charlatans. Because, hopefully by that time, we have solid ground to be standing on….if you can call that a method, that’s my method…and my actors seem to turn the way they want to, which is different from David Mamet. His method works very well though…”
Dana: “There’s an interrogation scene in the movie, with the little girl, where they quite literally put the words in her mouth, and I’ve read somewhere that this was based on a real transcript, can you tell me a bit about that?
Thomas: “Yes, it’s a police transcript, I’m not going to say which nationality because I don’t want to point fingers, I didn’t even want to point fingers at the police, but it’s from the 90’s, late 90s and they have improved, or at least they tried to improve…so I changed the scene to be some kind of interrogator, and I also took out a lot of very very ugly stuff, it was much much worse, and in all the cases it was much worse. You wouldn’t believe how much people put in children’s minds, how leaning the questions are…because they anticipate that the child…who wants to escape from it, because it is very unpleasant, therefore they sort of insist on this, and through that they implant false memories and they’ve done that in many many many cases. And I think that police is not doing a lot of that but the parents and a lot of kindergarten workers, they don’t know shit about this, they don’t know what to do, so they ask the same question to this poor child, and it becomes part of this child’s fantasy, and to satisfy the grownups they start inventing stuff…and again they end up as the victims, ‘cause they grow up to believe it, they grow up with the memory of having been assaulted without having been assaulted…so they grow up with a similar problem, similar needs, and they are violated by the overprotection, the fearfulness of our society…but in my film she appears to be a she-devil in people’s minds, which is not intended, because she was so nice, and she’s in love with him, so it’s an innocent love..and who wouldn’t be in love with Mads Mikkelsen?”

Browsing the internet puts your privacy at risk. Companies want to track your behavior to create a detailed profile about you to serve personalized ads. Browser trackers enable companies to collect a significant amount of data and track your online activities. You can easily become a victim of adware, which is not only intrusive but also slows down your device.
The security of your devices is also at risk, especially when shopping online or using cloud-based services. Cybercriminals are on the lookout for personal data, trying to steal passwords, bank details, or even hijack your computer access to use your devices for attacks against others. Keyloggers, rootkits, spyware, Trojans, and worms are just some of the malware types that can attack your system. To keep your system secure and protect your privacy, you need to install an antivirus software, designed to detect and remove malware. With regular virus scans, you can protect your computer against a wide range of threats.
The Windows Defender Antivirus is installed by default on all devices running Windows 10. While it is a good option for conducting basic virus scans, it does not offer complete protection. When tested by IT security experts, the default windows antivirus didn’t perform as well as other antivirus software, often failing to block malware. Furthermore, Windows Defender

------------question-----------------------
What are the advantages of digital film over 70mm film according to the text
------------correct----------------------
sed to shoot with that type of film. Today, there are limited resources in terms of projectors that can play 70mm film, let alone projectionists trained to expertly show these types of films on a regular basis.
Essentially, 35mm film did to 70mm film what digital film is currently doing to 35mm film… making it obsolete. 35mm film was more manipulable for different formats, and could be squeezed and bent more easily without distortion, unlike 70mm film.
The Digital Revolution
Traditional motion pictures are recorded on analog film frames, whereas digital film is recorded as digital video images. That is a fundamental difference that creates a very different visual experience for movie-goers who prefer “the real thing”. Digital film is captured like a digital photograph, using light sensors and digital receptors to resolve the image, but that’s only the very basic version.
High-definition video (Hi-def) has even better resolution, and this has since been followed up by 2K and 4K, creating an arms race to create the most incredibly clear and detailed movies on the market. Digital film is useful and preferred in many instances because it can be crunched down to whatever size is most convenient, without losing much resolution. For example, a new movie that is shot on digital film, rather than celluloid film, can be manipulated and shrunk to fit on the screen of a tablet or smartphone without compromising picture quality.
In a mobile, device-oriented society, this flexible capability makes it more profitable and sensible for most directors to shoot films in a digital format. Even most old movies have been re-recorded in digital formats for that same reason – ease of distribution and consumption.
One might think that with our ever-advancing digital technology, the resolution would be far better in a high-definition digital film, making the discussion of 70mm vs. digital superfluous. However, high-format celluloid films (70mm) have relatively comparable, if not better, resolution than high-definition digital films. There is also an authentic edge to old-school cinematography, which is often lost in the glossy, sterile, and polished appearance of digital projection.
While neither of these two formats can be called “better” than the other, the decision of whether to support or see a digital film vs. a 70mm film truly comes down to personal preference. For traditional film lovers, a movie shot in 70mm will always be superior to the plasticized images of a digital film, whereas superhero blockbuster fans are almost certainly digital film supporters, considering those CGI effects and epic battle scenes would likely be impossible without digital magic!

and that our names would appear in the playbill. “But don’t worry: we won’t have to do any of the work.”
As it turned out, just a few weeks later we were summoned to a backers meeting. Unless each of us came up with an additional hundred thousand dollars, the show would be cancelled. The rent for the theater needed to be paid upfront.
There was a lot of yelling and screaming. One woman, with a thick Brooklyn accent, shouted that she thought the rent was already taken care of by the money we had laid out. But after about an hour of acrimonious discussion, each of the backers agreed to pony up an additional hundred thousand dollars.
As Charlotte and I left the meeting, she said that with just a week to go before previews, she certainly hoped that there wouldn’t be any further surprises. I just nodded my head, while crossing my fingers.
Amazingly, everything went smoothly right up to opening night. Marty and Richie would wear their tuxedos, and Charlotte and I had bought beautiful evening gowns for the occasion. Immediately after the performance, we would attend a cast party at Sardi’s, which would set back each of the producers another five thousand bucks. It would be exciting to hear the first reviews read to what Charlotte was calling “our team.”
Just a few minutes before we would be leaving for the theater, Charlotte got a phone call from Marcy. The show was cancelled!
The producer had never paid the theater, so we had been locked out. The producer had screwed the actors, swindled the backers, and disappeared with all their money. And even if we somehow came up with all the rent money, it was now too late. The show would not go on.
“But what about the cast party?” I asked.
“Well, I guess that’s still on. But it won’t be much of a party.”
“So are we going?”
“Why not? I mean, it is paid for. And besides, I really want to be there for Marcy.”
When we got to the party, the entire cast was already there. And every one of them was crying. Charlotte went over to Marcy, and Marty, Richie, and I headed to the bar.
Charlotte spent a lot of time with Marcy, but there was no consoling the girl. This was probably her only shot at being in a Broadway play. When Charlotte joined us, there were tears in her eyes.
We stuck it out till the end of the party. When Marty remarked how happy he was that we hadn’t driven into the city, we all agreed. None of us was in any shape to drive home In fact, Richie looked like we might have to carry him out to the street.
As we left the restaurant I said to Charlotte, “This must have been the worst day of Marcy’s life. And probably of the lives of most of the other cast members.”
“And I feel really stupid about being swindled for all that money.”
“Yeah, I know exactly how you feel!” added Marty.
“Connie, I’m so sorry I got you into this.”
“Hey, it’s only money!”
“Yeah, that’s true. And I hope that someday we’ll look back at this and maybe even laugh at our stupidity.”
“Oh look, there’s a cab that’s actually not ‘off duty;’” So we hailed it, got in, and told the driver to take us to Douglaston.
He asked if we were coming from the theater. Rather that tell him our long sob story, I just said that we were. Then, perhaps to be polite, Charlotte asked him if he was an actor. He certainly was very handsome.
“Yes, I actually am an actor”
“Really?” said Charlotte. She paused for three or four seconds. “We’re Broadway producers!”

------------question-----------------------
What themes are explored in the novel regarding Thea's experiences as a fifteen-year-old girl
------------correct----------------------
hips. But the very feelings and impulses that caused so much trouble for Thea in Florida begin to assert themselves at Yonahlossee as well.
Disclafani does a remarkable job channeling into the complex and sometimes contradictory emotions of a fifteen year old girl (Anton Discalfani is female). If you’ve read any reviews, you know that this novel involves a sexual coming of age story. It also does a fine job of situating its characters in a specific period of US history which involved great upheaval as families once wealthy became impoverished and some women yearned for more than the narrow life of marriage and family.
There are a number of strong female characters in the story. Thea is at the top of the list. For a 15 year old, she has a strong sense of purpose and desire, a fearlessness and recklessness that she embraces. Though she resents and is hurt by the separation from her family, she eventually sees that it’s the best thing that has happened to her. Mrs. Holmes, married to the camp’s headmaster, seems to see all and know all at the school, is the head disciplinarian and fundraiser. She knew Thea’s mother when they were in school together and seems to know the details of Thea’s transgressions. One of Thea’s more interesting classmates, Leona, is aloof and stoic, from a very wealthy family and a superb horsewoman. Leona and Thea share a passion for horses and have a confidence and determination that the other girls lack. Most of them aspire to a good marriage and some are forced for financial reasons to marry young.
The final resolution of the novel, where we learn exactly what happened between Thea, Sam and Georgie and its aftermath, is a little surprising. Some details can be gleaned from Thea throughout her tale, but the big reveals are saved for the end. I found this to be a well constructed novel with engaging characters and a clever plot. Another great read for summer

------------question-----------------------
What does the text suggest about the relationship between assurance of salvation and the possibility of losing one's salvation
------------correct----------------------
was a man like that. He believed in assurance. He preached doctrine, he preached messages on the doctrine of assurance, but he also believed that it was theoretically possible for a man to lose his salvation. Mr. Wesley said, “That so far as he was concerned, he didn’t think he would lose his,” but he thought it was theoretically possible for some to lose their salvation. So it’s possible for a person to believe in assurance of salvation, and not believe in the certainty of ultimate salvation.
So let’s think about the doctrine of security, and one of the greatest of all of the passages on the doctrine of the security of the believer is in this same Gospel of John. So let’s turn over to chapter 10, verse 22 through verse 30. John 10: 22 through 30. Now, I think I’ll just read along here a few verses, since we have a little bit of time. I’ll begin reading at verse 22.
“Then came the feast of dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter. And Jesus was in the Temple area, walking in Solomon’s colonnade. The Jews gathered around him saying, ‘how long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.’ Jesus answered, ‘I did tell you, but you do not believe. The miracles I do in my Father’s name speak for me. But you do not believe, because you are not my sheep.’”
Notice that statement. “You do not believe, because you are not my sheep.” How about that? “You do not believe, because you are not my sheep.” If sheep do believe, those who don’t believe, don’t believe because they’re not his sheep. Sounds like he believes in election, doesn’t it? “My sheep listen to my voice.” Notice that. “My sheep listen to my voice.” Evidently, all the sheep of the Lord Jesus hear his voice. Those who don’t hear it are not his sheep. How about that? “I know them, and they follow me. My sheep hear my voice, and they follow me.” The sheep hear the voice of the shepherd, recognize it, and they follow him. There is the inevitable change of life. They follow him. Now, they may wander off, and the shepherd may have to go out, and go and pull them out of the briars, and they may fall in the ditch, and he may have to pull them up. And they may break an arm or a leg and he may have to carry them in, but nevertheless, they do try to follow. And he says.
“I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish. No one can snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all. No one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one.”
This is one of the great passages on sovereign grace in the New Testament. God is the sculptor of the spiritual life from the beginning to the end, so that for man, nothing remains in which to boast since it is all of God. Now, if there is a passage that demolishes synergism, it is this.
Now, I think, since we have a few moments, I’m going to just put the word “synergism” here on the overhead and let you take a good look at it because it is one of the words that you should be familiar with. S-Y-N-E-R-G-I-S-M. Now, let me just say just a word about what it means. The Greek word sun is the word that means “with” and “synergism,” this “ergism” is from a Greek word that means “to work.” Ergon so mi. Ergon means “a work.” So “synergism” means a “working together,” a “doing together.”
Now, synergism is particular theological idea. It is the idea that salvation is a work of God and a work of man. Synergism. Synergism, therefore, represents the legalistic heresy. Let me read you a brief statement from one of the theological dictionaries on synergism. The Greek words mean or Greek word means “working together with.” The doctrine such as that of Philip Melancthon, who followed the Lutheran Church; that the human will has a part to play along with the Holy Spirit or the grace of God in the process of salvation. So synergism is any kind of doctrine which sets forth the way of salvation as being both a work of God and a work of man.
Now, the most deceptive form of synergism is, of course, the doctrine of the semi-Pelagians. Pelagius just said, “A man may get to heaven will apart from divine grace. He may of himself reach heaven. He may by the activity of his human will believe and be saved.” Now, in the case, of course, Pelagius’ doctrine was a doctrine that the Church rejected. Semi-Pelagian, Pelagianism arose afterwards, and semi-Pelagianism laid stress on the fact that men had free will and as a decision of the free will was that which brought divine grace, which resulted in their salvation. Synergism.
Now, Augustine and Pelagius fought out the question of synergism in human salvation, and Augustine’s doctrine won out for a time in the Roman Catholic Church. Augustine’s doctrine was “monergism.” Now, monorgism comes from the same root; “ergism” which is from the word “work,” but monos in Greek means “below.” So monergism is that salvation is a work entirely of God. Synergism; that man and God cooperate in the work of salvation, and historically, those who believe that salvation is the work of a decision of the free will, plus what Christ did on the Cross, that is synergism. The Christian church, from Augustine through the Reformers and the Lutherans, regarded this as heretical teaching because it is a denial of grace that salvation is altogether of God. So monergism is the teaching of the Bible. That is what is meant when, for example, Jonah says, “Salvation is of the Lord,” not of the Lord and man, but of the Lord. So monergism.
Arminianism also has stressed man’s freedom, either to accept or to reject the regenerating grace of God in Christ, and in the event that man accepts it, sufficient grace is given to all men, and if they accept it as the decision of their free will then God gives them salvation. Arminianism is, therefore, synergistic in its doctrine of salvation. Now, we want to stress the fact that Arminianism is, of course, the doctrine of many men who are Christians, because their thoughts are confused. They will say, “We are saved by the grace of God” in one breath, and then they will say, “We must make a decision of our free will.” Now, those things are contradictory, but Arminians frequently do not see the contradiction. We’ll give them the benefit of the doubt; say, “Yes, they are good Christians, they’re just confused Christians.”
Now, if we look at our own Christian experience, we’ve been confused about things too, haven’t we? Most of us have advanced through some confusion, and some of us, a lot of confusion into the clarity with which we see the gospel, and the truths of the Bible today, and we hope that we will advance through whatever remaining confusions that we may have to even greater clarity. That’s why we’re here. But synergism is demolished by the grace of God, and if we believe, for example, that a person is saved by the grace of God but we believe that he can fall away by the works that he may do thereafter, he is in effect saying, that he’s saved by what Christ did, plus what he continues to do, and thus, his doctrine of salvation becomes synergistic. The true believer cannot fall away from salvation, either totally or finally. He is saved eternally.
Now with that in mind, look at these statements that the Lord makes. Here in John chapter 10 in verse 27, he says, “My sheep listen to my voice. I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life.” Now notice he does not say, “I give them six months life.” He does not say, “I give them one year’s life.” He does not say, “I give them life until they commit mortal sin” but “I give them eternal life.” Now that in itself teaches that the life that we have is a life that goes on and on. Notice it is “given.” It’s not “earned.” We don’t cooperate to earn it. It is a monergistic doctrine. “I give them eternal life.” Furthermore, to emphasize the fact that that eternal life is eternal he says, “And they shall never perish.”
Now in the Greek, that’s the strongest way to express a negative prohibition. “I give unto them eternal life,
------------expect----------------------
was a man like that. He believed in assurance. He preached doctrine, he preached messages on the doctrine of assurance, but he also believed that it was theoretically possible for a man to lose his salvation. Mr. Wesley said, “That so far as he was concerned, he didn’t think he would lose his,” but he thought it was theoretically possible for some to lose their salvation. So it’s possible for a person to believe in assurance of salvation, and not believe in the certainty of ultimate salvation.
So let’s think about the doctrine of security, and one of the greatest of all of the passages on the doctrine of the security of the believer is in this same Gospel of John. So let’s turn over to chapter 10, verse 22 through verse 30. John 10: 22 through 30. Now, I think I’ll just read along here a few verses, since we have a little bit of time. I’ll begin reading at verse 22.
“Then came the feast of dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter. And Jesus was in the Temple area, walking in Solomon’s colonnade. The Jews gathered around him saying, ‘how long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.’ Jesus answered, ‘I did tell you, but you do not believe. The miracles I do in my Father’s name speak for me. But you do not believe, because you are not my sheep.’”
Notice that statement. “You do not believe, because you are not my sheep.” How about that? “You do not believe, because you are not my sheep.” If sheep do believe, those who don’t believe, don’t believe because they’re not his sheep. Sounds like he believes in election, doesn’t it? “My sheep listen to my voice.” Notice that. “My sheep listen to my voice.” Evidently, all the sheep of the Lord Jesus hear his voice. Those who don’t hear it are not his sheep. How about that? “I know them, and they follow me. My sheep hear my voice, and they follow me.” The sheep hear the voice of the shepherd, recognize it, and they follow him. There is the inevitable change of life. They follow him. Now, they may wander off, and the shepherd may have to go out, and go and pull them out of the briars, and they may fall in the ditch, and he may have to pull them up. And they may break an arm or a leg and he may have to carry them in, but nevertheless, they do try to follow. And he says.
“I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish. No one can snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all. No one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one.”
This is one of the great passages on sovereign grace in the New Testament. God is the sculptor of the spiritual life from the beginning to the end, so that for man, nothing remains in which to boast since it is all of God. Now, if there is a passage that demolishes synergism, it is this.
Now, I think, since we have a few moments, I’m going to just put the word “synergism” here on the overhead and let you take a good look at it because it is one of the words that you should be familiar with. S-Y-N-E-R-G-I-S-M. Now, let me just say just a word about what it means. The Greek word sun is the word that means “with” and “synergism,” this “ergism” is from a Greek word that means “to work.” Ergon so mi. Ergon means “a work.” So “synergism” means a “working together,” a “doing together.”
Now, synergism is particular theological idea. It is the idea that salvation is a work of God and a work of man. Synergism. Synergism, therefore, represents the legalistic heresy. Let me read you a brief statement from one of the theological dictionaries on synergism. The Greek words mean or Greek word means “working together with.” The doctrine such as that of Philip Melancthon, who followed the Lutheran Church; that the human will has a part to play along with the Holy Spirit or the grace of God in the process of salvation.

What type of injury did Cardinals running back David Johnson sustain during the Week 1 loss to the Detroit Lions
------------correct----------------------
Cardinals’ Johnson seeing specialists for dislocated wrist, may need surgery
Cardinals running back David Johnson will meet with specialists regarding his wrist injury that took him out of Arizona’s Week 1 loss to the Detroit Lions on Sunday, and their opinions will determine if he needs surgery, reports ESPN’s Adam Schefter.
Bruce Arians told reporters Monday that Johnson suffered a dislocated wrist that is “likely” to require surgery. The injury, which could land him on the injured reserve has the same prognosis as injured rookie running back T.J. Logan, Arians said.
Logan’s timeline was set at as many as 12 weeks for a return.
“You just got to pick up the pieces and go,” Arians told Bickley and Marotta on 98.7 FM, Arizona’s Sports Station. “David Johnson became David Johnson because somebody got hurt. It’s an opportunity for Kerwynn (Williams) — and Andre Ellington looked fast again — to come back and pick up the pace.
“We’ll see what options there are available to us off the roster, but those two guys are more than capable of having big games.”

Policy Language Can Curtail Long-Tail Insurance Claims

The New York Court of Appeals recently clarified the law concerning such allocation of liability in Keyspan Gas East Corp. v. Munich Reinsurance America, Inc.

What were some observations made at the Military Blogging conference regarding military bloggers and their influence
------------correct----------------------
I attended the Military Blogging conference to
- learn about military, retired military, and military support groups who use of social media
- meet people who represent groups that help military families.
A summary of my observations are:
- Military bloggers are passionate, as you would expect.
- Military bloggers who began blogging in 2002 and 2003 were leaders and drove a grass roots movement that led to identifying military bloggers in a loosely structured group, but tightly connected and networked individuals. The blog sites are aggregated on the Military Blogging web site.
- Thousands of non-profit organizations serve military, soldiers, veterans, and families.
- Throughout this community of military bloggers, they all have a sense of responsibility toward families.
- As military families engage, the expression and sharing of small frustrations is often what ties military spouses together, regardless of their location.
- Social media has enabled a community of individuals who are passionate about the military to form tight bonds of respect, admiration, trust, expectations, and influence among this community.
- Over time, these bloggers have become influential not only among their own online communities, but also in making a difference in perceptions, policy, and legislation.
- One reason for their influence is that blogging has moved to, and is encouraged, by soldiers and others to tell real stories.
- Though some of the early bloggers, started blogging anonymous, now it seems that there is not a concern of separating personal life and professional life online. In fact, telling own personal stories are encouraged.
- @pricefloyd, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, says that military needs more conversations on topics about the military. Does not mean that mistakes will not be made and that mistakes that have been made are not more harmful than other mistakes.

How does prenatal maternal stress affect infant gut microbiota development
------------correct----------------------
1. Inhibits the production of neurosteroids which play a large part into how well you handle stress later in life.
2. Prenatal maternal stress, compared to a low stress control condition, has been shown to affect the infant microbiota (beneficial bacteria) measured at 7, 14, 28, 80, and 110 days of age in infants, suggesting important effects of adverse early life experience on the gut microbiome.
3. In humans, early-life stress is associated with a preterm birth and a low birth weight, and can prime the neonate for further complications later in life that include psychiatric disorders, aged-related cognitive dysfunction, obesity, and hypertension.
4. Exposure of the developing fetus to excessive levels of stress hormones in the womb can cause mood disorders in later life.
Adverse environment in early life
An adverse environment in early life has been demonstrated to be one of the most important factors affecting long life health. In humans, early adverse experiences, such as abuse, neglect, or loss of a parent, have an impact on cardiometabolic risk profile and increase the risk of developing mental health disorders, including attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorders, anxiety, depression, suicide, drug abuse, and post traumatic stress disorder. Talge et al2 revealed a large body of research relating stress to health and found an attributable load of emotional/behavioral problems and language delay because of prenatal stress and/or anxiety in approximately 15% of subjects.
Animal studies have also suggested that exposure to stressors or steroids during early life alters the programming of neuroendocrine and neuroimmune systems. For example, maternal separation of rodent pups during the first 2 weeks of life has been shown to induce alterations in behavior and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity to stress that persists throughout life.
The long-term effects of early life stress on vulnerability to neurological events, such as seizures or stroke, are well documented. These findings provide evidence that early life stress modifies the development of the HPA axis, brain function, and neurobehavior.
Early‐Life Stress: Neuroactive Steroids
Animal studies have amply demonstrated that stress exposure during pregnancy or in early postnatal life can adversely influence brain development and have long‐term ‘programming’ effects on future brain function and behavior. Furthermore, a growing body of evidence from human studies supports the hypothesis that some psychiatric disorders may have developmental origins.
Consequences of early‐life stress can cause: dysregulation of the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal (HPA) axis, heightened anxiety behavior and cognitive impairments. Neuroactive steroids modulate neuronal activity and play a key role in neurodevelopment. Moreover they can negatively modulate activity of the HPA axis, exert anxiolytic actions and influence cognitive performance.
Thus, neuroactive steroids may provide a link between early‐life stress and the resultant adverse effects on the brain and behavior. An enhanced understanding of the influence of early‐life stress on brain neurosteroid systems could aid the identification of new targets for developing treatments for stress‐related conditions in humans.
The Quality of Family Life
The quality of family life influences the development of individual differences in vulnerability for affective illnesses. Victims of childhood physical or sexual abuse or parental neglect are at considerably greater risk for affective disorders. Epidemiological studies provide compelling support for the association between cumulative, adverse childhood experiences and the risk for depression. This association remains significant when adjusting for living with a mentally ill parent, thus removing the effects of a gene-environment correlation.
Moreover, there is commonly a dose-response relationship between the number of types of adversity associated and the magnitude of the risk for depression. Statistical modeling demonstrates mediation by multiple intermediate variables, potentially acting with different degrees of effects at varying life stages. These include personality (neuroticism), low self-esteem, conduct disorder, increased risk of adverse life events, low social support, and difficulties in interpersonal relationships.
The results of prospective, longitudinal studies confirm the link between abuse/neglect and depression. Moreover, childhood maltreatment also associates with an increased severity of illness, reduced treatment responsivity, and increased comorbidity.
Broader forms of familial dysfunction including persistent emotional and physical neglect, family conflict, cold, distant parent-child relationships, and conditions of harsh, inconsistent discipline compromise cognitive and emotional development and increase the risk for depression and anxiety disorders to a level comparable to that for ab

What issue is the author experiencing with the 'page is opened' event when a form is submitted
------------correct----------------------
I have an issue where ‘page is opened’ event is not being called properly.
My process involves a form being submitted and then re-opening the same instance. Additional parameters then call a parent form and then show the page I require. . The page shows correctly but the ‘page is opened’ events are not called. If I click away from the page and then back again it works OK but this is not ideal for the user. Any ideas

What is Kolab and what features does the new 2.3.0 server include
------------correct----------------------
“For the plane in the fog, the mountain is unforeseeable, but then it is suddenly very real, and inevitable.”
Simon Forster, Minister for foreign relations
WHAT IS KOLAB?
Kolab is a personal information management solution, also referred to as groupware. It can provide and manage your information including email, address books, calendars and tasks.
The Kolab server acts as the central information repository and thanks to its uniquely powerful design can host up to tens of thousands, theoretically even hundreds of thousands of users.
All these users can freely share email, address books, calendars and/or tasks with all, some, or none of the other users. This allows Kolab to provide the support base for a wide variety of activities, such as coordinating appointments, working on common projects and ensuring consistency in customer contact.
The new Kolab 2.3.0 server includes a lot of new features, namely:
- Z-push synchronization for mobile devices
- A reworked webadmin
- The possibility to have multiple accounts with the same name.
- Modular packaging of the webclient
- Many updated core components
- Tons of bug fixes
A detailed list of changes is available here
Because of the changes in LDAP, upgrading from 2.2.4 is not trivial and requires manual intervention. Please make sure you read and follow the upgrade instructions in http://files.kolab.org/server/release/kolab-server-2.3.0/sources/1st.README
Documentation and OpenPKG packages are available from here as shown on http://kolab.org/download.html.
Binary packages for Debian GNU/Linux 6.0 (Squeeze/stable) and 5.0 (Lenny/oldstable) on x86 platforms can be found next to the sources.

Cardinals’ Johnson seeing specialists for dislocated wrist, may need surgery
Cardinals running back David Johnson will meet with specialists regarding his wrist injury that took him out of Arizona’s Week 1 loss to the Detroit Lions on Sunday, and their opinions will determine if he needs surgery, reports ESPN’s Adam Schefter.
Bruce Arians told reporters Monday that Johnson suffered a dislocated wrist that is “likely” to require surgery. The injury, which could land him on the injured reserve has the same prognosis as injured rookie running back T.J. Logan, Arians said.
Logan’s timeline was set at as many as 12 weeks for a return.
“You just got to pick up the pieces and go,” Arians told Bickley and Marotta on 98.7 FM, Arizona’s Sports Station. “David Johnson became David Johnson because somebody got hurt. It’s an opportunity for Kerwynn (Williams) — and Andre Ellington looked fast again — to come back and pick up the pace.
“We’ll see what options there are available to us off the roster, but those two guys are more than capable of having big games.”

What should users do before using the new release in a critical environment
------------correct----------------------
ropped because it is no longer supported by Debian ether.
As soon as they have synced, you can also use the the mirrors listed on http://kolab.org/mirrors.html
You can check the integrity of the downloaded files by importing our file distribution key and verify the OpenPGP signature and SHA1 checksums:
$ wget https://ssl.intevation.de/Intevation-Distribution-Key.asc
$ gpg –import Intevation-Distribution-Key.asc
$ gpg –verify SHA1SUMS.sig
$ sha1sum -c SHA1SUMS
This release marks the end of a long development cycle. After over 2 years, the master and the stable branch are (more or less) in sync again. We
introduced many new features and fixed a large number of bugs. We tested the release intensively but due to the massive code changes, we might have missed something or even introduced new bugs.
Before you use this release in a critical environment, we’d like you to test it. Please report any problems you encounter in our bug tracker: https://bugzilla.kolabsys.com/
Depending on the number and severity of bugs, we will issue an updated release soon. We already have a number of fixes in the queue such as the today’s Z-push 1.5.2 release, so Kolab 2.3.1 will come soon.
I’d like to thank a few people for their help, namely and in no particular order:
– Paul and Georg, for giving me the chance to work on a great project like Kolab
– Bernhard for his coordination
– Thomas and Sascha for their support, especially during this week
– Bogo for the awesome new look of the webadmin
– Jeroen for his input and providing me the infrastructure I need
– Gunnar for responding so fast to the issues we spotted
Without these people the Kolab Server 2.3 would not be possible. Thank everybody for your hard work!

What new safety features have been added to the Hyundai Kona Electric
------------correct----------------------
hour on a 50 kW rapid - for the Hyundai Kona Electric 64 kWh, and under 50 minutes on rapid points for the smaller battery model.
Key added equipment includes a new safety package fitted to the Kona Electric, which sees a range of new features added to the previously already well-specified set-up. Safe Exit Warning, Rear Seat Alert, and Rear Cross Traffic Collision Avoidance Assist are some of those added to elements that had included Smart Cruise Control, Lane Keep Assist, and Driver Attention Warning.
Convenience improvements include heated rear seats, added USB ports in the rear, and five new colours, doubling the choice available. The most obvious change comes with the addition of Hyundai’s 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system, which brings with it the latest BlueLink systems and connected car features.

Safe Exit Warning, Rear Seat Alert, and Rear Cross Traffic Collision Avoidance Assist are some of those added to elements that had included Smart Cruise Control, Lane Keep Assist, and Driver Attention Warning.
Convenience improvements include heated rear seats, added USB ports in the rear, and five new colours, doubling the choice available. The most obvious change comes with the addition of Hyundai’s 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system, which brings with it the latest BlueLink systems and connected car features.

Evidence to Policy, a monthly note series on learning what works, highlights studies that evaluate the impact of programs in the critical areas of human development --health, education, social protection, water and sanitation and labor. From how to best supply rural health clinics with drugs to what helps students do better in school, World Bank-supported impact evaluations provide governments and development experts with the information they need to use resources most effectively. As impact evaluations increasingly become more important to policymakers, this series offers a non-technical review of the many innovations the World Bank is supporting, and the growing number of rigorous studies analyzing the impacts of those innovations. The note series is managed by SIEF, which receives generous funding from the British government's Department for International Development and the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF).
The impact evaluation of a conditional cash transfer program targeting nutrition in young children showed good results, and now the Government of Bangladesh is scaling up the nutrition component of the program to reach more poor households.

The Philippines is successfully using conditional cash transfers to improve health and education for the poorest families, but the program hasn't been effective at raising school enrollment for older children. Based on the evaluation, the government has increased the transfer amount for older children.
In Tanzania, an innovative conditional cash transfer program that relies on local communities to administer the payments has succeeded in helping the country’s poorest citizens. As the results of a recent impact evaluation indicate, cash transfer systems can be adapted to work well in low-income countries that don’t have a strong central government to administer them.

Individuals who make a planned gift to Linfield, either through a bequest in a will or living trust or a remainder designation in a life-income gift, retirement plan or life insurance policy, are recognized through membership in the Linfield College Founders' Society.
The Founders' Society was created so that the college could offer its thanks during the lifetimes of the many generous individuals who make these gifts from their life's work through any of the many gift plans. The most common method of securing membership in the Founders' Society is by making Linfield a beneficiary of your estate. You don't have to be wealthy to be able to make a significant impact on the future of Linfield through an estate gift. Over the last ten years, estate gifts have provided an average of $1.6 million in annual gift revenue to Linfield. With the bulk of these gifts designated for the college's endowment, these gifts strengthen Linfield's stature as a leading, small liberal arts college for generations to come.
Founders' Society members are invited to and recognized during an annual luncheon held during Homecoming weekend in the fall, and their names are listed in Linfield's Honor Roll of Donors.
If you've already completed a gift plan that includes Linfield, but haven't yet notified anyone at the college about it, please contact Craig L. Haisch '95 at firstname.lastname@example.org or at 503-883-2675 or fill out our letter of intent form (PDF) so that we can thank you for helping strengthen the Linfield experience.

What role did Charlotte envision for herself in addition to being a full-time mother
------------correct----------------------
Charlotte and I have been best friends since kindergarten. While neither of us will admit how long we’ve been celebrating our thirty-ninth birthdays, it certainly has been for a while.
Our mothers bred us to marry rich men. Marty and I were going steady when I was in my freshman year of college and he was a pre-med sophomore. I put him through medical school, and today his ads proclaim him the “Nose Job King of Queens.”
Charlotte also married very well. Richie’s father owns a chain of nursing homes. And though the elder Mr. Feinberg has been indicted for Medicaid fraud a few times, he proudly points out that he has never been convicted. As Charlotte likes to say, “I lend the Feinberg family a touch of class.”
I suppose that’s true. Charlotte had always wanted to be an actress. She’d starred in every play since middle school. But before we finished college, it was sadly apparent that the only way she would ever appear in even an off-off-Broadway play would be if the Feinberg family produced it.
When Charlotte half-jokingly mentioned the idea to her father-in-law, he got a good laugh out of it. “Believe me,” he said, “the nursing home business gives our family enough entertainment.”
Perhaps that was the exact moment when the dream died: Charlotte realized that her role in life – at least for the next fifteen years – would be a full-time mother.
Our families live on the same block in the Douglaston section of Queens, a well-to-do community on the Nassau County line. Our kids play together, our husbands are buddies, and most importantly, we have fulfilled our mothers’ dreams.
But was this all there was in life? More and more, Charlotte would whine about how she missed “Broadway.” And my response was always, “Charlotte, we can get front row seats for any Broadway play. And we’ve seen every hit in the last twenty years.”
“That’s not what I mean and you know it, Connie!”
“Charlotte, you know and I know that it’s way too late to resume your acting career.”
“Who said anything about acting? I’ve decided to become a Broadway producer.”
“You and who else?”
“Funny you should ask.”
“I don’t follow.”
“Connie, you and I are going to produce a Broadway play.”
“Are you insane?”
“I’ve never been saner in my entire life!”
“Charlotte, you need help! Should I call a doctor?”
“Who, Marty?” We both burst out laughing. She reached out and hugged me. Still laughing, Charlotte said, “Do you really think I need a nose job?”
“Sure. Marty could do an enhancement, so your nose would be in proper proportion to your swelled head.” We just laughed and laughed.
Finally, I asked, “You are serious, aren’t you?”
“Connie, I’ve never been more serious in my life.”
“How much will it cost us?”
“About a quarter of a million each.”
“There are several other backers.”
“How did you get involved in this?”
“You remember my niece, Marcy?”
“Oh, sure! The actress who has been following in your footsteps.”
“Well, let me tell you something, Connie. Little Marcy is all grown up now. She’s had parts in a few off-Broadway plays, and now she’s up for a great part in a Broadway play: It’s the chance of a lifetime!”
“That’s great, Charlotte!”
“Well, it could be great! The only problem is that the backers are half a million short.”
“Look, Charlotte, if it means that much to you, I’ll talk to Marty. I’m sure we can swing it.”
The next day I called Charlotte to tell her that Marty and I were in. But I felt just a little uneasy when she said that we would actually be associate producers,

What were the findings of the World Bank's evaluations related to social protection programs in Latvia, Ethiopia, Nicaragua, and Chile
------------correct----------------------
eness of Latvia's public works program, the World Bank supported an evaluation of the government-sponsored public works initiative, which was launched in response to the global financial crisis of 2008–2010.The evaluation found that the program successfully reached its intended target, helping Latvia's worst-off cope with the crisis by increasing their short-term incomes. For policymakers and development experts, this evaluation underscores the usefulness of public works programs as emergency social safety net instruments even in upper–middle income countries.
To understand the role that social protection programs can play in helping people feed themselves and their families, the World Bank supported an evaluation of an ongoing program in Ethiopia. This program includes a public works component for the poor. A complementary initiative works to build household agricultural assets so families can better provide for themselves. The evaluation found that these measures boost food security, helping households better manage year-round.
To learn whether cash grants and training can help poor, rural farmers develop alternative income sources so they better manage during weather “shocks” that harm or destroy crops, the World Bank evaluated a Nicaraguan government program that sought to assist families after a bad drought. Two years after the program ended, researchers found that families that received vocational training or small business grants were better protected against droughts than those who qualified only for conditional cash transfers.
This policy note reviews a World Bank-supported evaluation of Chile's Solidario social assistance program, which aims to reach families living in extreme poverty. The research shows that twinning regular social worker visits with changes to the programs themselves to increase access and better meet demand did lead to increased take-up of subsidies.

rstand how two-way and multi-way engagement becomes powerful.
- Social media is not only used to disseminate but also to engage to learn, and possibly change, leaders’ approacha and behavior.
- @pricefloyd says that having dissenting comments and points of view that do not have approval gives more credibility to the engagement.
- Military uses 3rd party sites so the world can read and interact and tell stories first hand reports from the troops.
- The approach is to encourage people throughout the military to “go out and tell their stories”. Military leaders know that those online are professionals and “will do the right thing”.
- Army leaders encourage individuals to blog on their own sites and link and cross link to the army blog site. They don’t care about negative articles or positive article, but they care that bloggers tell accurate stories.
- The military has to use both traditional and new media.
- The leaders see that criticisms are good because it means others are reading the blogs and gives something for them to learn. Negative criticisms will stay blogs unless it is overly obscene.
This conference has been one that is somewhat out of my element. It is refreshing to hear from leaders of the military who “get social media”, understand how
- conflicting opinions are ways to learn and adjust.
- personal accounts can be powerful ways to tell the military story.
- engagement leads to learning and improving
- trusting people throughout the military to do the right thing without posting strict rules is a good way to capitalize personalized stories.
- grass-roots connections build credibility and trust.
All day, I keep thinking that if the military can trust their people to do the right thing and find value in dissenting comments, why aren’t more educational institutions in-tuned to the value of learning and improving based on the freedom of engagement.

1. Inhibits the production of neurosteroids which play a large part into how well you handle stress later in life.
2. Prenatal maternal stress, compared to a low stress control condition, has been shown to affect the infant microbiota (beneficial bacteria) measured at 7, 14, 28, 80, and 110 days of age in infants, suggesting important effects of adverse early life experience on the gut microbiome.
3. In humans, early-life stress is associated with a preterm birth and a low birth weight, and can prime the neonate for further complications later in life that include psychiatric disorders, aged-related cognitive dysfunction, obesity, and hypertension.
4. Exposure of the developing fetus to excessive levels of stress hormones in the womb can cause mood disorders in later life.
Adverse environment in early life
An adverse environment in early life has been demonstrated to be one of the most important factors affecting long life health. In humans, early adverse experiences, such as abuse, neglect, or loss of a parent, have an impact on cardiometabolic risk profile and increase the risk of developing mental health disorders, including attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorders, anxiety, depression, suicide, drug abuse, and post traumatic stress disorder. Talge et al2 revealed a large body of research relating stress to health and found an attributable load of emotional/behavioral problems and language delay because of prenatal stress and/or anxiety in approximately 15% of subjects.
Animal studies have also suggested that exposure to stressors or steroids during early life alters the programming of neuroendocrine and neuroimmune systems. For example, maternal separation of rodent pups during the first 2 weeks of life has been shown to induce alterations in behavior and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity to stress that persists throughout life.
The long-term effects of early life stress on vulnerability to neurological events, such as seizures or stroke, are well documented. These findings provide evidence that early life stress modifies the development of the HPA axis, brain function, and neurobehavior.
Early‐Life Stress: Neuroactive Steroids
Animal studies have amply demonstrated that stress exposure during pregnancy or in early postnatal life can adversely influence brain development and have long‐term ‘programming’ effects on future brain function and behavior. Furthermore, a growing body of evidence from human studies supports the hypothesis that some psychiatric disorders may have developmental origins.
Consequences of early‐life stress can cause: dysregulation of the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal (HPA) axis, heightened anxiety behavior and cognitive impairments. Neuroactive steroids modulate neuronal activity and play a key role in neurodevelopment. Moreover they can negatively modulate activity of the HPA axis, exert anxiolytic actions and influence cognitive performance.
Thus, neuroactive steroids may provide a link between early‐life stress and the resultant adverse effects on the brain and behavior. An enhanced understanding of the influence of early‐life stress on brain neurosteroid systems could aid the identification of new targets for developing treatments for stress‐related conditions in humans.
The Quality of Family Life
The quality of family life influences the development of individual differences in vulnerability for affective illnesses. Victims of childhood physical or sexual abuse or parental neglect are at considerably greater risk for affective disorders. Epidemiological studies provide compelling support for the association between cumulative, adverse childhood experiences and the risk for depression. This association remains significant when adjusting for living with a mentally ill parent, thus removing the effects of a gene-environment correlation.
Moreover, there is commonly a dose-response relationship between the number of types of adversity associated and the magnitude of the risk for depression. Statistical modeling demonstrates mediation by multiple intermediate variables, potentially acting with different degrees of effects at varying life stages. These include personality (neuroticism), low self-esteem, conduct disorder, increased risk of adverse life events, low social support, and difficulties in interpersonal relationships.
The results of prospective, longitudinal studies confirm the link between abuse/neglect and depression. Moreover, childhood maltreatment also associates with an increased severity of illness, reduced treatment responsivity, and increased comorbidity.
Broader forms of familial dysfunction including persistent emotional and physical neglect, family conflict, cold, distant parent-child relationships, and conditions of harsh, inconsistent discipline compromise cognitive and emotional development and increase the risk for depression and anxiety disorders to a level comparable to that for ab

WHAT IS KOLAB?
Kolab is a personal information management solution, also referred to as groupware. It can provide and manage your information including email, address books, calendars and tasks.
The Kolab server acts as the central information repository and thanks to its uniquely powerful design can host up to tens of thousands, theoretically even hundreds of thousands of users.
All these users can freely share email, address books, calendars and/or tasks with all, some, or none of the other users. This allows Kolab to provide the support base for a wide variety of activities, such as coordinating appointments, working on common projects and ensuring consistency in customer contact.
The new Kolab 2.3.0 server includes a lot of new features, namely:
- Z-push synchronization for mobile devices
- A reworked webadmin
- The possibility to have multiple accounts with the same name.
- Modular packaging of the webclient
- Many updated core components
- Tons of bug fixes
A detailed list of changes is available here
Because of the changes in LDAP, upgrading from 2.2.4 is not trivial and requires manual intervention. Please make sure you read and follow the upgrade instructions in http://files.kolab.org/server/release/kolab-server-2.3.0/sources/1st.README
Documentation and OpenPKG packages are available from here as shown on http://kolab.org/download.html.
Binary packages for Debian GNU/Linux 6.0 (Squeeze/stable) and 5.0 (Lenny/oldstable) on x86 platforms can be found next to the sources.

What was Niall's response to the idea that the crowd thought he would buy them drinks
------------correct----------------------
s no way she’s going to beat Niall, she’s just too small. He’s not a particularly big guy, but big enough. He’s about my height and weight, which lead me to ponder what this girl was thinking.
We moved some empties out of the way, they set up, a small crowd had gathered. It was over almost as quickly as it started.
Niall kind of shrugged and picked up his cash. I suggested to him that maybe they figured he would buy them some drinks and therefore they wouldn’t really be out any cash. Niall’s response was priceless.
“Fuck that. They can buy their own drinks.

The New York Court of Appeals recently clarified the law concerning such allocation of liability in Keyspan Gas East Corp. v. Munich Reinsurance America, Inc. The outcome in Keyspan, in favor of the insurer, rested largely on the language of the insurance policy in question. Further, the Court of Appeals rejected the insured's public policy argument, thereby giving weight to the policy language and setting New York apart from states that have required insurers to bear the risk of loss during periods where c

My process involves a form being submitted and then re-opening the same instance. Additional parameters then call a parent form and then show the page I require. .

How should Mink Mink Magnetic lashes be stored to maintain their shape and longevity
------------correct----------------------
up wipe or additional cotton ball if residue of eyeliner remains.
To store lashes, return each lash to the magnetic strip on the tray insert found within the original packaging and return to box. This will help to maintain the overall shape and curl of the lashes as well as prevent dirt or debris from coming into contact with lashes while being stored.
When properly cared for your Mink Mink Magnetic lashes, they are reusable around 50 times
TIP: To to increase the longevity and maintain the original style of your Mink Mink lashes, do not apply mascara directly on them. Instead, apply mascara to your natural lashes first, allow it to dry, then apply your Mink Mink lashes.

------------answer-----------------------
Dr. S. Lewis Johnson continues his discussion of the Reformed doctrines set forth in the Apostle John's gospel.
[Message] The subject for tonight in our continuation of the study of Johannine thought is “Assurance, Security and Perseverance.” We’re dealing again with some of the aspects of the doctrine of soteriology in John’s thought, and I’m going to begin with a few words by way of introduction.
The doctrines of assurance, security, and perseverance have never been very popular doctrines. They are popular to us in Believers Chapel because most of us believe them, but they have never really been popular doctrines. The popular language is the language of doubt. We surmise. We suppose. We may, therefore, assume. It is probably true, et cetera. In fact, the Church herself has historically never been widely known for creating a sense of certainty among her adherents. A believer’s assurance of pardon of his sins, the Council of Trent affirmed, is a vain and ungodly confidence. So there is a great tradition in the Christian Church for doubt over many of the doctrines of the faith.
Cardinal Bellermein, the champion of Roman Catholicism and its defense, called the doctrine of assurance “a prime error of the heretics.” In this, he was not following Rome’s greatest theologian, for Augustine said, “To be assured of our salvation is no arrogant stoutness. It is our faith. It is no pride. It is devotion. It is no presumption. It is God’s promise.”
What do we mean by the terms, “assurance, security and perseverance?” Well, when we talk about the doctrine of the assurance of salvation, we generally mean assurance is the doctrine that affirms that the believer may have the certainty of salvation now. So assurance is the certainty that we are saved at the present moment. The doctrine of security is the doctrine that affirms that the believer may have the certainty of salvation not only now but also forever. That’s really the doctrine of the eternity of the spiritual life. In fact, it probably would have been better if the Christian Church had spoken not of eternal security but the eternity of the spiritual life or the question of the continuity of the life is really the issue. “Continuity,” one of the contemporary theologians has said, “is the central problem of those problems which must engage us.” Eternal security, furthermore, is not a biblical term, and since it’s not a biblical term, there are always certain people who are inclined to say, “Well, it’s not found in the Bible itself, the term eternal security so, therefore, I have some question about it being a biblical doctrine.”
Now, that’s a foolish attitude, of course, because there are so many things that are not found in the Bible precisely; that is, the very terms, but the truth is taught there; that it’s, I say, foolish to make statements like that but, nevertheless, people still make them. There is, as we all know, no mention of Trinity in the Bible, but if there is one doctrine that under girds it all, it is the doctrine of the Trinity: The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; the three persons of the godhead, and yet one God who subsists in these persons. There is nothing in the Bible specifically about the old nature and the new nature, and again, there is no specific statement that says, “eternal security.” So it probably would have been better, for the sake of people who have a weakness about that, to talk about the doctrine of “eternal life.” If we called it the doctrine of eternal life, we would be saying the same thing, or the doctrine of the “eternity of the spiritual life”. That would be all right too.
So assurance is the certainty of salvation now. Security is the certainty of salvation both now and forever. What is the doctrine of perseverance? People speak of perseverance a great deal. Well, that’s the human side of eternal security. He secures and preserves us, and we, therefore, persevere. Even Spurgeon, who was a complete Calvinist, used to say that, “He thought it was more scriptural to speak of the perseverance of the Savior than of the saints. It is, strictly speaking not man, but God who perseveres.” So when we talk about the perseverance of the saints, well, we’re talking about something that is biblical but, nevertheless, it probably would be wiser to speak about the perseverance of God or, at least, to make it plain that it is God who perseveres. This is the human side of the doctrine of eternal security.
Now, sometimes the doctrine of perseverance is misunderstood and I’d like to make even plainer what is meant by the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints. The doctrine of the perseverance of the saints is not simply the doctrine that the elect will be saved in the end, but rather that the elect, once converted, never fall from their salvation and will be saved to the end. Now I say that because there are those who believe that it is possible to be saved and lost and even possible for the elect to be saved and lost, but they will surely be saved again. Lutherans, for example, believe that men may lose their salvation. They do not believe, however, that the elect may lose their salvation ultimately, but they may pass through the experience of being saved and lost, and saved and lost, and some lost forever. But the elect may be saved and lost, but they will be saved ultimately.
Now, the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints is not merely to the effect that the elect will certainly be saved in the end, but also that they can never fall from the life the eternal life that they have when they believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. They may have fallen to sin upon occasion but they will not fall from their salvation. And, furthermore, it is probably true to say that the doctrine of perseverance also teaches that the life that we obtain through regeneration, and the habits of it, will never entirely disappear from the experience of the Christian. In other words, there has to be some evidence that we have passed from death into life. It’s possible that no one ever sees that. It’s possible that a man has truly believed in Jesus Christ, and we do not see any of the effects of that, but they must be there because the change of life will manifest itself. Only God may see it. He may see it in some changed attitudes towards the saints or towards the Bible or saints may do things of which we don’t have knowledge.
So when we say that a person is a saint and say he will persevere in the faith, we mean he will not apostatize from the faith. He will be preserved by the Lord to the end as a saved individual. And we also mean that he has had a change of life; a definite change of life and those habits that appear from the work of the Spirit in sanctification, can never entirely disappear from him. To put it simply, as one of the leading theologians has put it, “Perseverance is that continuous operation of the Holy Spirit in the believer, by which the work of divine grace that is begun in the heart, is continued, and brought to completion.” So assurance, the certainty of salvation now; eternal security, the certainty of salvation now and forever; perseverance, the human side of eternal security, and perseverance is the truth that the believer will certainly be saved in the end. He will not fall from his salvation once he possesses it, and there will be a distinct change in his life as a result of his conversion.
Well now, let’s look at assurance first and in the outline, in case you are keeping outlines of the studies in Johannine theology, in my notes this is Roman I: Assurance, and John 3:31 through 36. So turn with me to the 3rd chapter of the Gospel of John, and let me read beginning at verse 31 through verse 36. Now, I’m reading tonight from the New International Version. My Authorized Version is about to fall to pieces, and that lady wrote from Saint Lucia that she wanted a Bible and three or four people in the congregation have already gotten ready to send her a Bible. She touched the hearts of

Listen to this post
The battle between old-school nostalgia and modern gadgetry has been raging for centuries, but it seems to have reached a fever pitch in recent decades, given our rapid improvements in technology, increase in consumer demand, and cultural divides between old and new. Vinyl or MP3? Satellite or cable? Books or Kindles? Batman or Superman?
This struggle between modernity and tradition is particularly obvious in the world of film, where aging film buffs and modern indie film fans frequently duke it out over which type of film is better – 35 mm, 24mm, 70mm, IMAX, digital…?
With the recent resurgence of throwback film techniques (most notably, Quentin Tarantino’s use of 70mm film to shoot his 2015 western thriller The Hateful Eight – see the clip above), a whole new generation of people are being exposed to some nearly forgotten film styles, and an ancient debate is heating up once again.
What is 70mm Film?
As the advertisements for Tarantino’s latest film proudly proclaimed, the movie would be available for viewing in “Glorious 70mm – Ultra Panavision 70”, and most people had no idea what they meant. Well, 70mm is just another variety of analogue film, more specifically, a film reel with frames that are 70mm in width. The gauge for most motion pictures is 35mm, and while most movies are still wonderful to watch, the difference when you jump to a 70mm gauge is quite noticeable.
The resolution of 70mm film is much better than 35mm, providing a richer visual experience and extremely detailed images that are a joy to watch. This type of film also changes the aspect ratio of the film, stretching it to a wider 2.2:1 ratio, rather than the typical 1.35:1 (known as the Academy ratio) or 16:9 (widescreen ratio). This makes 70mm films ideal for larger and wider screens (for example, IMAX films shoot on a special type of 70mm film).
Now, it’s important to remember that Tarantino is far from the first person to use 70mm film for a movie; in fact, the technology dates back to the very beginning of cinema. Throughout film history, when a director wanted to shoot an epic film, such as Ben-Hur or Lawrence of Arabia, they would choose to shoot on 70mm film. This was perfect for the Panavision movie palaces that featured extremely wide screens and could accommodate the wider image of these early “blockbusters”. However, as the decades passed, movie theaters evolved (and shrank), the popularity of the lighter and less expensive 35mm film grew, and 70mm film fell from popularity, despite its undeniably better quality.
The equipment to transport, store, and play 70mm film was expensive, bulky, and difficult to manipulate, as were the cameras u

Charlotte and I have been best friends since kindergarten. While neither of us will admit how long we’ve been celebrating our thirty-ninth birthdays, it certainly has been for a while.
Our mothers bred us to marry rich men. Marty and I were going steady when I was in my freshman year of college and he was a pre-med sophomore. I put him through medical school, and today his ads proclaim him the “Nose Job King of Queens.”
Charlotte also married very well. Richie’s father owns a chain of nursing homes. And though the elder Mr. Feinberg has been indicted for Medicaid fraud a few times, he proudly points out that he has never been convicted. As Charlotte likes to say, “I lend the Feinberg family a touch of class.”
I suppose that’s true. Charlotte had always wanted to be an actress. She’d starred in every play since middle school. But before we finished college, it was sadly apparent that the only way she would ever appear in even an off-off-Broadway play would be if the Feinberg family produced it.
When Charlotte half-jokingly mentioned the idea to her father-in-law, he got a good laugh out of it. “Believe me,” he said, “the nursing home business gives our family enough entertainment.”
Perhaps that was the exact moment when the dream died: Charlotte realized that her role in life – at least for the next fifteen years – would be a full-time mother.
Our families live on the same block in the Douglaston section of Queens, a well-to-do community on the Nassau County line. Our kids play together, our husbands are buddies, and most importantly, we have fulfilled our mothers’ dreams.
But was this all there was in life? More and more, Charlotte would whine about how she missed “Broadway.” And my response was always, “Charlotte, we can get front row seats for any Broadway play. And we’ve seen every hit in the last twenty years.”
“That’s not what I mean and you know it, Connie!”
“Charlotte, you know and I know that it’s way too late to resume your acting career.”
“Who said anything about acting? I’ve decided to become a Broadway producer.”
“You and who else?”
“Funny you should ask.”
“I don’t follow.”
“Connie, you and I are going to produce a Broadway play.”
“Are you insane?”
“I’ve never been saner in my entire life!”
“Charlotte, you need help! Should I call a doctor?”
“Who, Marty?” We both burst out laughing. She reached out and hugged me. Still laughing, Charlotte said, “Do you really think I need a nose job?”
“Sure. Marty could do an enhancement, so your nose would be in proper proportion to your swelled head.” We just laughed and laughed.
Finally, I asked, “You are serious, aren’t you?”
“Connie, I’ve never been more serious in my life.”
“How much will it cost us?”
“About a quarter of a million each.”
“There are several other backers.”
“How did you get involved in this?”
“You remember my niece, Marcy?”
“Oh, sure! The actress who has been following in your footsteps.”
“Well, let me tell you something, Connie. Little Marcy is all grown up now. She’s had parts in a few off-Broadway plays, and now she’s up for a great part in a Broadway play: It’s the chance of a lifetime!”
“That’s great, Charlotte!”
“Well, it could be great! The only problem is that the backers are half a million short.”
“Look, Charlotte, if it means that much to you, I’ll talk to Marty. I’m sure we can swing it.”
The next day I called Charlotte to tell her that Marty and I were in. But I felt just a little uneasy when she said that we would actually be associate producers,

use. Family life also serves as a source of resilience in the face of chronic stress. Thus, warm, nurturing families tend to promote resistance to stress and to diminish vulnerability to stress-induced illness. The epidemiology of affective disorders reflects the profound influence of family life on neural development and mental health.
Early Social Environment
The relationship between the quality of the early social environment and health in adulthood appears to be, in part, mediated by the development of individual differences in neural systems that underlie the expression of behavioral and endocrine responses to stress.
Thus, physical and sexual abuse in early life increases endocrine and autonomic responses to stress in adulthood. Likewise, variations in parental care associate with individual differences in neuroendocrine and autonomic responses to stress in humans as well as emotional reactivity. Finally, there is considerable evidence in favor of the hypothesis that individual differences in stress reactivity predict the risk for depression
Thus, the influence of familial depressive illness is, in part at least, mediated by increased stress reactivity, enhancing the response of the individual to mild, regular stressors (ie, hassles). Individuals with early adverse experience appear to be sensitized to the depressive effects of acute stress in adulthood.
We have all felt it – stress. Sometimes it is a powerful ally that helps us perform better in an exam or when giving a talk. But when it turns into a long-lasting partner, it can become a serious health problem that may even interfere with our ability to live a normal life. Furthermore, stress is a key issue in certain periods of our life, such as pregnancy.
A number of scientific studies have already linked stress in pregnant women to premature birth, low birth weight, some skin conditions, asthma and even anxiety and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the reasons underlying these associations remain elusive. So what if gut microbiota played a role?
A new study by researchers from the Behavioural Science Institute of Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands, published in the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology, appears to shed some light on this link between stress in pregnant women and their babies’ microbiota.
According to the authors of the study, mothers who experience high and prolonged levels of stress during gestation are more likely to have infants with more probabilities of suffering intestinal problems and allergic reactions.
The scientists recruited 56 pregnant mothers and measured women’s levels of stress by asking them to complete a questionnaire and to provide a saliva sample in which they analysed the concentrations of cortisol (the so-called stress hormone) prior to delivery. The Dutch researchers subsequently examined the microbiota of the babies’ guts through stool samples collected from the age of 7 days up until 4 months after birth.
According to this team of experts, there is a correlation between highly stressed pregnant mothers and the composition of microbes in the newborns’ guts. These infants had a significantly higher relative abundance of Proteobacterial groups, known, in the author’s words, to contain pathogens (Escherichia, Serratia and Enterobacter), and lower quantities of lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Aerococcus and Bifidobacteria.
Altogether, experts consider this pattern to be related to a potentially increased level of inflammation. This aberrant colonization pattern was related to more maternally reported infant gastrointestinal symptoms and allergic reactions. They also saw that breastfeeding, which is known to promote the development of beneficial microbes in the intestine due to the prebiotic content of breast milk, was not enough to protect the baby from the negative effects of its mother’s stress.
Although it remains a theory, researchers speculate that the cortisol may be interfering with bile production, which could, in turn, influence gut bacteria. They also highlight this stress hormone may be able to pass through the placenta and increase cortisol levels in the foetus, thus affecting the development of the gastrointestinal tract.
According to the authors of the paper, the study has shown clear links between the mother’s stress during pregnancy and the baby’s gut microbiota development and health. For these Dutch experts, the results suggest there is a possible mechanism by which maternal prenatal stress influences the development of the foetus.
Nevertheless, the reasons behind this link are still unknown and require further research. Finally, researchers from Radboud University Nijmegen consider their findings may open up a potential way for bacterial interventions to improve health and development in babies born to stressed mothers.
Maternal prenatal stress is associated with the infant intestinal microbiota. (*)

What are some advantages of 70mm film over 35mm film
------------correct----------------------
Listen to this post
The battle between old-school nostalgia and modern gadgetry has been raging for centuries, but it seems to have reached a fever pitch in recent decades, given our rapid improvements in technology, increase in consumer demand, and cultural divides between old and new. Vinyl or MP3? Satellite or cable? Books or Kindles? Batman or Superman?
This struggle between modernity and tradition is particularly obvious in the world of film, where aging film buffs and modern indie film fans frequently duke it out over which type of film is better – 35 mm, 24mm, 70mm, IMAX, digital…?
With the recent resurgence of throwback film techniques (most notably, Quentin Tarantino’s use of 70mm film to shoot his 2015 western thriller The Hateful Eight – see the clip above), a whole new generation of people are being exposed to some nearly forgotten film styles, and an ancient debate is heating up once again.
What is 70mm Film?
As the advertisements for Tarantino’s latest film proudly proclaimed, the movie would be available for viewing in “Glorious 70mm – Ultra Panavision 70”, and most people had no idea what they meant. Well, 70mm is just another variety of analogue film, more specifically, a film reel with frames that are 70mm in width. The gauge for most motion pictures is 35mm, and while most movies are still wonderful to watch, the difference when you jump to a 70mm gauge is quite noticeable.
The resolution of 70mm film is much better than 35mm, providing a richer visual experience and extremely detailed images that are a joy to watch. This type of film also changes the aspect ratio of the film, stretching it to a wider 2.2:1 ratio, rather than the typical 1.35:1 (known as the Academy ratio) or 16:9 (widescreen ratio). This makes 70mm films ideal for larger and wider screens (for example, IMAX films shoot on a special type of 70mm film).
Now, it’s important to remember that Tarantino is far from the first person to use 70mm film for a movie; in fact, the technology dates back to the very beginning of cinema. Throughout film history, when a director wanted to shoot an epic film, such as Ben-Hur or Lawrence of Arabia, they would choose to shoot on 70mm film. This was perfect for the Panavision movie palaces that featured extremely wide screens and could accommodate the wider image of these early “blockbusters”. However, as the decades passed, movie theaters evolved (and shrank), the popularity of the lighter and less expensive 35mm film grew, and 70mm film fell from popularity, despite its undeniably better quality.
The equipment to transport, store, and play 70mm film was expensive, bulky, and difficult to manipulate, as were the cameras u

What actions did the EPA take regarding the pesticide chlorpyrifos after the SAP review
------------correct----------------------
d by these effects, while adults seem to be more able to fight, but in adults who work in fields where chlorpyrifos is used, studies have indicated higher rates of lung cancer and respiratory issues.
Even after this SAP forced the EPA to review its findings, the EPA still declared chlorpyrifos to be excessively dangerous.
There are environmental effects, too. Chlorpyrifos is known to be toxic to aquatic animals, like shrimp. Additionally,evidence indicates that it’s toxic to bees as well, though research is ongoing into specifically how the residue of the pesticide affects them.
Just How Common Is This Stuff, Though?
Ha. Well, it’s one of the most popular pesticides in the country. According to The Intercept, about 44,000 farms use a total of 6 to 10 million pounds of chlorpyrifos-containing pesticides each year. It was registered in 1965, and organophosphates (the category including chlorpyrifos) came into popularity after the ban on DDT in 1972.
So How Can Pruitt Explain His Decision?
Pruitt, in his official statement, claimed that the EPA’s findings are unreliable. “The USDA disagrees with the methodology used by the previous Administration,” reads the statement. “The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) also expressed concerns with regard to EPA’s previous reliance on certain data the Agency had used to support its proposal to ban the pesticide.”
This is confusing! What the heck is FIFRA SAP?
Scientific Advisory Panels (SAPs) are independent groups of people who can compel the USDA to review some of its work. In theory, this stops governmental science from being too insular, but in practice…well, just for example, this SAP that “expressed concerns” to the EPA hosted not one but four people testifying “on behalf of Dow Agrochemicals,” as well as someone from CropLife America (a lobbying group for the pesticide industry), a scientist from Syngenta, and a guy who makes his living by operating the planes used to spray pesticides. (That’s in addition to a whole mess of scientists and doctors and farmers and anti-pesticide people.)
It’s important to have differing viewpoints, but testimony from people who have an immediate financial connection to a product up for review seems…questionable. That said, the panel itself is made up of scientists, doctors, and researchers associated with universities; Dow is not allowed a vote, but they are allowed to take a giant chunk of time to try to get the panel on their side.
And it’s worth noting that even after this SAP forced the EPA to review its findings, the EPA still declared chlorpyrifos to be excessively dangerous.
What Happens Now?
Nothing. Chlorpyrifos will continue to be used unless Pruitt allows the EPA to review the pesticide sometime before 2022

------------answer-----------------------
Chlorpyrifos is an organophosphate insecticide, which means that it acts by basically shutting down an enzyme in insects that enables them to control their muscles and organs. Organophosphates have been banned in household situations since 2000, but continue to be permitted in agricultural use, where they’re extremely widely used in a spray format on crops like almonds, fruit trees, and corn.
In July of 2016, the EPA, in response to a few other studies alleging chlorpyrifos’s danger (like this one from Columbia), performed its own health assessment on chlorpyrifos, and declared that the ways the pesticide is normally used are not safe. From their site:
Based on current labeled uses, the revised analysis indicates that expected residues of chlorpyrifos on food crops exceed the safety standard under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). In addition, the majority of estimated drinking water exposure from currently registered uses, including water exposure from non-food uses, continues to exceed safe levels, even taking into account more refined drinking water exposure. This assessment also shows risks to workers who mix, load and apply chlorpyrifos pesticide products.
But late last night (Wednesday, March 29), Pruitt decided to reject this finding – yes, his own agency’s research – and declined to ban the insecticide, claiming the research is “unreliable.” The manner in which he did this is called a “final agency action,” which the Yale Law Journal calls an “unusual statutory requirement.” It essentially means that the issue will not be reexamined until 2022, when the EPA is legally required to take another look at chlorpyrifos (the agency is required to re-evaluate all pesticides every 15 years, though they can accelerate those if they choose). The next review date for chlorpyrifos is set for October of 2022.
So Why is Chlorpyrifos Bad?
Chlorpyrifos goes under a few brand names, most commonly Dursban and Lorsban, and is manufactured by Dow Chemical. (The company is very keen to keep farmers using the pesticide.) Evidence from the EPA points to a litany of serious issues with chlorpyrifos. In children, it’s been associated with higher levels of autism and inattention disorders, intelligence deficits, low birth weight, decreased motor skills, and more. Children may be exposed to this in a variety of ways: drifting residue from crop spraying, direct contact on farms, seeping into local waterways, etc. Studies indicate that in places where chlorpyrifos is used, especially the agricultural regions of California, children display higher rates of chlorpyrifos in their systems than the EPA considers safe – and these aren’t children working in the fields; these are just kids who live in California’s Central Valley. Youths are hit particularly har

Truth be told, this wallet ($9.99!!) was the inspiration for this post. I couldn’t leave Target without him yesterday!
This trio from At West End would look great on a tablescape or mantel!

What happened at the backers meeting that almost led to the cancellation of the show
------------correct----------------------
and that our names would appear in the playbill. “But don’t worry: we won’t have to do any of the work.”
As it turned out, just a few weeks later we were summoned to a backers meeting. Unless each of us came up with an additional hundred thousand dollars, the show would be cancelled. The rent for the theater needed to be paid upfront.
There was a lot of yelling and screaming. One woman, with a thick Brooklyn accent, shouted that she thought the rent was already taken care of by the money we had laid out. But after about an hour of acrimonious discussion, each of the backers agreed to pony up an additional hundred thousand dollars.
As Charlotte and I left the meeting, she said that with just a week to go before previews, she certainly hoped that there wouldn’t be any further surprises. I just nodded my head, while crossing my fingers.
Amazingly, everything went smoothly right up to opening night. Marty and Richie would wear their tuxedos, and Charlotte and I had bought beautiful evening gowns for the occasion. Immediately after the performance, we would attend a cast party at Sardi’s, which would set back each of the producers another five thousand bucks. It would be exciting to hear the first reviews read to what Charlotte was calling “our team.”
Just a few minutes before we would be leaving for the theater, Charlotte got a phone call from Marcy. The show was cancelled!
The producer had never paid the theater, so we had been locked out. The producer had screwed the actors, swindled the backers, and disappeared with all their money. And even if we somehow came up with all the rent money, it was now too late. The show would not go on.
“But what about the cast party?” I asked.
“Well, I guess that’s still on. But it won’t be much of a party.”
“So are we going?”
“Why not? I mean, it is paid for. And besides, I really want to be there for Marcy.”
When we got to the party, the entire cast was already there. And every one of them was crying. Charlotte went over to Marcy, and Marty, Richie, and I headed to the bar.
Charlotte spent a lot of time with Marcy, but there was no consoling the girl. This was probably her only shot at being in a Broadway play. When Charlotte joined us, there were tears in her eyes.
We stuck it out till the end of the party. When Marty remarked how happy he was that we hadn’t driven into the city, we all agreed. None of us was in any shape to drive home In fact, Richie looked like we might have to carry him out to the street.
As we left the restaurant I said to Charlotte, “This must have been the worst day of Marcy’s life. And probably of the lives of most of the other cast members.”
“And I feel really stupid about being swindled for all that money.”
“Yeah, I know exactly how you feel!” added Marty.
“Connie, I’m so sorry I got you into this.”
“Hey, it’s only money!”
“Yeah, that’s true. And I hope that someday we’ll look back at this and maybe even laugh at our stupidity.”
“Oh look, there’s a cab that’s actually not ‘off duty;’” So we hailed it, got in, and told the driver to take us to Douglaston.
He asked if we were coming from the theater. Rather that tell him our long sob story, I just said that we were. Then, perhaps to be polite, Charlotte asked him if he was an actor. He certainly was very handsome.
“Yes, I actually am an actor”
“Really?” said Charlotte. She paused for three or four seconds. “We’re Broadway producers!”

hat Johnson will make a decision on how to handle his injury in the next day or two.
NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport added a re-signing of veteran Chris Johnson could be a potential addition to the running back room. Arians also said Johnson is an option.
Reports after the Cardinals’ 35-23 loss indicated a wide range of timelines following Johnson’s injury, which was reported to be a sprained wrist. Rapoport reported there was no break, but Chris Mortensen added that a team source believed Johnson could miss “a few weeks” to “half the season or more.”
Johnson rushed for 23 yards on 11 carries and added six receptions for 68 yards before he left the game late in the third quarter.
The third-year back was injured on a play that led to a lost fumble.
- Arians endorses Bettcher, Armstrong for Cardinals’ head coaching job
- PFF: Budda Baker a top performer among 2017 second rounders
- Browns to hire former Cardinals special teams coach Amos Jones

------------question-----------------------
What serious issues have been associated with chlorpyrifos, particularly in children
------------correct----------------------
Chlorpyrifos is an organophosphate insecticide, which means that it acts by basically shutting down an enzyme in insects that enables them to control their muscles and organs. Organophosphates have been banned in household situations since 2000, but continue to be permitted in agricultural use, where they’re extremely widely used in a spray format on crops like almonds, fruit trees, and corn.
In July of 2016, the EPA, in response to a few other studies alleging chlorpyrifos’s danger (like this one from Columbia), performed its own health assessment on chlorpyrifos, and declared that the ways the pesticide is normally used are not safe. From their site:
Based on current labeled uses, the revised analysis indicates that expected residues of chlorpyrifos on food crops exceed the safety standard under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). In addition, the majority of estimated drinking water exposure from currently registered uses, including water exposure from non-food uses, continues to exceed safe levels, even taking into account more refined drinking water exposure. This assessment also shows risks to workers who mix, load and apply chlorpyrifos pesticide products.
But late last night (Wednesday, March 29), Pruitt decided to reject this finding – yes, his own agency’s research – and declined to ban the insecticide, claiming the research is “unreliable.” The manner in which he did this is called a “final agency action,” which the Yale Law Journal calls an “unusual statutory requirement.” It essentially means that the issue will not be reexamined until 2022, when the EPA is legally required to take another look at chlorpyrifos (the agency is required to re-evaluate all pesticides every 15 years, though they can accelerate those if they choose). The next review date for chlorpyrifos is set for October of 2022.
So Why is Chlorpyrifos Bad?
Chlorpyrifos goes under a few brand names, most commonly Dursban and Lorsban, and is manufactured by Dow Chemical. (The company is very keen to keep farmers using the pesticide.) Evidence from the EPA points to a litany of serious issues with chlorpyrifos. In children, it’s been associated with higher levels of autism and inattention disorders, intelligence deficits, low birth weight, decreased motor skills, and more. Children may be exposed to this in a variety of ways: drifting residue from crop spraying, direct contact on farms, seeping into local waterways, etc. Studies indicate that in places where chlorpyrifos is used, especially the agricultural regions of California, children display higher rates of chlorpyrifos in their systems than the EPA considers safe – and these aren’t children working in the fields; these are just kids who live in California’s Central Valley.
