What factors can influence the observed spectra of AGN galaxies according to the text
------------correct----------------------
regions. If time variability is assumed I found that, due to clumpiness, it is not possible to change the spectrum of AGN galaxy from absorbed to unabsorbed, but clumps could be responsible for more mild variations in the spectra. If the X-ray and optical spectra are not simultaneously observed there exists some level of disagreement on the degree of obscuration. iii

In what is fast becoming the Book Flood of Summer 2014, even more exciting books have been turning up in the post and as eARCs…
Featuring: Anna Caltabiano, Orson Scott Card & Aaron Johnston, Richard A. Clarke, James S.A. Corey, Ellen Datlow (ed.), Emma Donohue, Daryl Gregory, Elliott Hall, Doug Hulick, Kameron Hurley, Kendra Leighton, D.J. Molles, Edward St. Aubyns, Liesel Schwarz, Graeme Shimmin, Nalini Singh, James Thornton
Rebecca, a 15-year-old American, isn’t entirely happy with her life, comfortable though it is. Still, even she knows that she shouldn’t talk to strangers. So when her mysterious neighbour Miss Hatfield asked her in for a chat and a drink, Rebecca wasn’t entirely sure why she said yes. It was a decision that was to change everything.
For Miss Hatfield is immortal. And now, thanks to a drop of water from the Fountain of Youth, Rebecca is as well. But this gift might be more of a curse, and it comes with a price. Rebecca is beginning to lose her personality, to take on the aspects of her neighbour. She is becoming the next Miss Hatfield.
But before the process goes too far, Rebecca must travel back in time to turn-of-the-century New York and steal a painting, a picture which might provide a clue to the whereabouts of the source of immortality. A clue which must remain hidden from the world. In order to retrieve the painting, Rebecca must infiltrate a wealthy household, learn more about the head of the family, and find an opportunity to escape. Before her journey is through, she will also have – rather reluctantly – fallen in love. But how can she stay with the boy she cares for, when she must return to her own time before her time-travelling has a fatal effect on her body? And would she rather stay and die in love, or leave and live alone?
And who is the mysterious stranger who shadows her from place to place? A hunter for the secret of immortality – or someone who has already found it?
One of Gollancz’s 2014 debuts, I was very much looking forward to reading this. I’m reading it at the moment and, while interesting and pretty well done, it isn’t really grabbing me… Hopefully it will pick up as I near the end…
Nearly 100 years before the events of Orson Scott Card’s bestselling novel Ender’s Game, humans were just beginning to step off Earth and out into the Solar System. A thin web of ships in both asteroid belts; a few stations; a corporate settlement on Luna. No one had seen any sign of other space-faring races; everyone expected that First Contact, if it came, would happen in the future, in the empty reaches between the stars. Then a young navigator on a distant mining ship saw something moving too fast, heading directly for our sun.
When the alien ship screamed through the solar system, it disrupted communications between the far-flung human mining ships and supply stations, and between them and Earth. So Earth and Luna were unaware that they had been invaded until the ship pulled into Earth orbit, and began landing terra-forming crews in China. Politics and pride slowed the response on Earth, and on Luna, corporate power struggles seemed more urgent than distant deaths. But there are a few men and women who see that if Earth doesn’t wake up and pull together, the planet could be lost.
This is the third volume in Card & Johnston’s The First Formic War series. Sadly, I haven’t read any of the Ender’s Game-related novels, so I’m not sure I’ll get to this in the immediate future. I will, however, be reading Ender’s Game pretty soon.
In Washington, the Kill Committee gathers in the White House’s Situation Room to pick the next targets for the United States drone program. At an airbase just outside Las Vegas, a team of pilots, military personnel and intelligence officers follow through on the committee's orders, finding the men who have been deemed a threat to national security and sentenced to death. On the other side of the world, in the mountains where the drones hunt their prey, someone has decided to fight back. And not just against the unmanned planes that circle their skies, but against the Americans at home who control them.
I’ve read a fair bit of Clarke’s non-fiction, so I’m curious to see what his fiction is like. Hot topic, drones.
The gates have opened the way to thousands of habitable planets, and the land rush has begun. Settlers stream out from humanity's home planets in a vast, poorly controlled flood, landing on a new world. Among them, the Rocinante, haunted by the vast, posthuman network of the protomolecule as they investigate what destroyed the great intergalactic society that built the gates and the protomolecule.
But Holden and his crew must also contend with the growing tensions between the settlers and the company which owns the official claim to the planet. Both sides will stop at nothing to defend what's theirs, but soon a terrible disease strikes and only Holden – with help from the ghostly Detective Miller – can find the cure.
I’m so behind on this series… This is the fourth novel in The Expanse series, yet I’ve only managed to read the first one, Leviathan Wakes. It was recently announced that the TV rights for the series have been bought and (possibly) started development. I’d like to catch up, and I’ll do my best to do so.
This deliciously creepy and loving tribute to the master of modern horror features riveting illustrated stories of his wicked progeny.
In the century since the master of horror, H. P. Lovecraft, published his first story, the monstrosities that crawled out of his brain have become legend: the massive, tentacled Cthulhu, who lurks beneath the sea waiting for his moment to rise; the demon Sultan Azathoth, who lies babbling at the center of the universe, mad beyond imagining; the Deep Ones, who come to shore to breed with mortal men; and the unspeakably-evil Hastur, whose very name brings death. These creatures have been the nightmarish fuel for generations of horror writers, and the inspiration for some of their greatest works.
This impressive anthology celebrates Lovecraft's most famous beasts in all their grotesque glory, with each story a gripping new take on a classic mythos creature and affectionately accompanied by an illuminating illustration. Within these accursed pages something unnatural slouches from the sea into an all-night diner to meet the foolish young woman waiting for him, while the Hounds of Tindalos struggle to survive trapped in human bodies, haunting pool halls for men they can lure into the dark. Strange, haunting, and undeniably monstrous, this is Lovecraft as you have never seen him before.
Sounds like an interesting anthology.
Summer of 1876: San Francisco is in the fierce grip of a record-breaking heat wave and a smallpox epidemic. Through the window of a railroad saloon, a young woman called Jenny Bonnet is shot dead. The survivor, her friend Blanche Beunon, is a French burlesque dancer. Over the next three days, she will risk everything to bring Jenny's murderer to justice – if he doesn’t track her down first. The story Blanche struggles to piece together is one of free-love bohemians, desperate paupers and arrogant millionaires; of jealous men, icy women and damaged children. It’s the secret life of Jenny herself, a notorious character who breaks the law every morning by getting dressed: a charmer as slippery as the frogs she hunts.
In thrilling, cinematic style, FROG MUSIC digs up a long-forgotten, never-solved crime. Full of songs that migrated across the world, Emma Donoghue's lyrical tale of love and bloodshed among lowlifes captures the pulse of a boom town like no other.
Some of my own research touched upon Chinese immigration into San Francisco during this period, so I thought the novel sounded quite interesting.
Harrison was the Monster Detective, a storybook hero. Now he’s in his mid-thirties, and spends most of his time popping pills and not sleeping. Stan became a minor celebrity after being partially eaten by cannibals. Barbara is haunted

Aref Abu Zeid used to be a heavy equipment engineer at the Libya Steel Company. Now he runs an 80-man team working 12 hours a day turning out rockets and weapons to fight Moammar Gadhafi's forces.
In this rebel stronghold in western Libya, civilian engineers, mechanics and tradesmen are pumping out materiel to arm the uprising against Gadhafi's rule that has become a civil war.
"None of us here have anything to do with the military," said Abu Zeid, 50, a short man with a thick salt and pepper beard and an easy smile. "Our need to protect our homes, our lives and our city forced us into this war work."
Misrata, the country's third-largest city located 125 miles (200 kilometers) southeast of the capital, is home to the largest steel company in the country and metal is always available here.
"Owners of carpentry and mechanical supply warehouses would just open their doors," Abu Zeid said. "They told us 'Take what you want.' Others bring us piles of money to buy what we need."
At the beginning of the war in Misrata, mechanics were repairing arms in their homes and garages. But as it raged on, the engineers realized they needed bigger operations and a more organized force.
That's when about eight schools across the city turned into weapons' workshops. Volunteers flooded in to help.
Abu Zeid's operation _ the Complete Industrial Skills College _ is a sprawling campus with shops fitted with welding gear and machinery where youngsters formerly learned engineering and machine making.
Now the weapons-making crews receive request forms from the front lines that ask for specific machinery and weapons.
Clanging metal and sparking welders fill the main workshop. The floor is strewn with electrical wiring and scrap metal. Old instructional and safety posters still hang on the walls, a reminder that this was once a school.
Two men worked on installing Grad rockets onto the back of a pickup truck. Scavenged car parts, scrap metal and captured rocket launchers made up the rest of the project.
The truck itself was one of hundreds the rebels found stored in Gadhafi's government and military buildings. They are Chinese knockoffs of a popula

unger people. In a living will, you can give your family members and doctors instructions about your desired medical care, in case you become incapacitated (comatose or brain-dead, for example) and can't tell them yourself. Some people say that they would not want to be kept alive by artificial means if they are in a vegetative state, and there's no chance of recovery. If this is you, that's definitely something to include in a living will. Of course, if you would prefer the opposite, being kept alive as long as is medically possible, you can put that in your living will, as well.
Power of Attorney: Power of attorney allows you to grant someone else (normally a trusted family member or friend) the power to make certain decisions in your place, with the same legal effect as if you had made them yourself, in the event that you become unable to do so (normally due to mental or physical incapacity). If you decide to give someone power of attorney, you should make your wishes known to them in advance, so they are more likely to make the same decisions that you would make, if you were able to. And, of course, you should only give this authority to someone with whom you would trust your life because that is, in some cases, just what you're doing.
Funeral Arrangements: You should make it very clear to the people handling your funeral what type of funeral you want, and what you want done with your body. You should not put these instructions in your will, because wills are commonly not read until days or weeks after the testator dies, by which point it may be too late to give their wishes on this subject effect.

What improvements are planned for the Bacchus Marsh Indoor Aquatic Centre with the announced funding
------------correct----------------------
The Rudd Labor Government today announced $7 million towards the Bacchus Marsh Indoor Aquatic Centre, building on its record of support for strong, prosperous regional and local communities.
The Minister for Regional Australia and Member for Ballarat, Catherine King, said this project would deliver great benefits to the community, and help build a stronger future.
“Federal Labor is serious about investing in regional and local communities and helping them to meet future challenges and opportunities,” Ms King said.
Ms King said funding for the Bacchus Marsh Indoor Aquatic Centre is a well-deserved win for the community and will provide for a new 25 metre 8 lane pool, a learn-to-swim pool, entry and kiosk, administration facilities and change rooms.
“Families across Bacchus Marsh will benefit enormously from this new indoor pool, particularly through expanded recreational options which will deliver improved health and lifestyle outcomes for all in the community.
“Today’s announcement comes after years of extensive consultation throughout the community about the importance of the indoor pool

What effect does Celie have on her customers in the boutique where she works
------------correct----------------------
t behind on her body by the man she calls Herr M., her rapist.
Celie, just as off-balanced but in a different way, works in a boutique frequented by “educated, rich, bored, frustrated, freaky-thin women who are dismayed that they have wound up being such clichés.” Celie makes her customers feel hopeful—“that the next item she brings them to try on will most certainly reinvent them. That suddenly they will see themselves in the mirror as they want to be seen.”
Statements like these pepper the novel and are easily applied to a reader’s personal experience, which makes them all the more entertaining, relevant, and insightful.
At times it can be difficult to follow the various characters because of the closeness of their names and the depth with which Hahn delves into the past and present circumstances that have shaped each one. But the author is a masterful storyteller and her tale, given its movement between those living and those dead, is unique and intriguing.

moments! I love planning unexpected moments and details! I love the joy on the clients face when they see our vision come to life!
3. Any fun trends that you are embracing this season? This season I am all about color blocking flowers, using single flower types and using unique vessels for vases. I love using vases of various shapes, sizes and textures and filling them with only one type of flower, a single stem when possible! Then I place the various single flower arrangements together to create a visually beautiful look! Its simple, chic and elegant!
Jove in his own words…
I have been planning events since I was a kid. Starting with family holiday parties and birthdays I would decorate the house with whatever I could find or make! My first job in high school was in an event company where I learned all about balloons and flowers. We designed and planned events of all shapes and sizes for Disney, Walmart, Dave and Busters and many others.
I officially started my own company after planning my best friends wedding in 2007. She called me one day and said she could not think of anyone better to do it, I was honored and fond myself loving every moment of the process and knew this was what I wanted to do with my life!
My company was born out of a passion for event and wedding planning! We are a boutique event planning company based out of New York City and we provide full service planning, partial planning as well as month of / day of wedding coordination

only when arms ceased to pour into the region “will the dust begin to clear away and the real human and political problems be seen in a clearer light.” The Times noted that an arms ban need not involve any Middle Eastern country in negotiations, yet would provide a “sharp test of Soviet sincerity.”
Asserting that “patience and goodwill” will not solve the problems of the region, the Times said that “Israel cannot be wished away by the Arabs or by anyone else.” It suggested that even if the Arab-Israel conflict were ended all insecurity and instability in the Middle East would not be ended

the media coverage is over the top, "sensationalized," he said. As a reporter I couldn't escape from the news, unlike clients of his whom he advises to just turn off the TV. It was true. I was at Bloomberg with 11 TV monitors in my line of sight.
Wall Street was right in betting that the U.S. wouldn't stop paying interest on its bonds, Benningfield said. I said my worry wasn't just default, but the unexpected consequences of even getting close. In corporate America, that would be called reputational risk. What happens if the government pays creditors but not Social Security recipients?
Benningfield has long experience calming clients who disagree with him. He didn't think my fear was irrational, he said diplomatically. "Markets are not necessarily great at pricing the risk of highly improbable events."
He tried to turn the conversation to something more productive -- not what the future holds but what my actual options were. I could sell my stocks. If I did, what would I do with the money? Ironically, the safest place to be in times of economic stress is usually U.S. government bonds, he said. Yes, that was ironic.
When actual clients call up Benningfield in a panic, his first question is whether they have the means, and the stomach, to weather a volatile market. If you have money in stocks that you need in just a few years, you shouldn't have those assets in stocks anyway, he says. That doesn't apply to me, he observed. With my stocks in a retirement plan I can't touch without penalties for decades, I can take plenty of short-term losses in exchange for long-term gains. My stress is the price long-term investors must pay.
"This is part of the plan," he said. "If the risk goes away, so do the the returns."
Then he told me a story about a surfer. I was watching 11 TVs at the moment and didn't entirely follow, but it seemed a veteran surfer was out off the California coast having a great day, the sun was out, the waves were perfect, all was well and he was bitten by a shark. I stopped watching 11 TVs.
The surfer survived to tell the tale, Benningfield added quickly, drawing this lesson: Some dangers we can see coming. Many we can't. I could exit the market now, only to jump back in when everything looked safe and then "get blindsided." The biggest profits often come to investors when the sharks are circling.
After hanging up with Benningfield, I pulled out my "Stock Trader's Almanac" and confirmed his contention that the market's worst days are often followed by its very best days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average's worst days of 1929 were Oct. 28 and 29, while its best was Oct. 30. Miss out on the losses and you'll probably miss out on the gains.
Benningfield is good at his job. I left my investments alone. But I felt just as anxious as before. More, really. And now I was thinking about sharks and one-legged surfers.
On the next day of the shutdown, the 10th, House Republican leaders floated the idea of lifting the debt limit temporarily. For six weeks. Now it's day 11. Will the deal fall apart, on all 11 TV screens? Even if it's approved, what happens in six weeks? Does this mean the government stays shuttered for even longer, damaging the economy in another unpredictable way?
I don't know. I do know I'm not doing anything stupid in the heat of the moment.
You hear that, Washington

What do ANA and Japan Airlines indicate about the reliability of the batteries in their 787 Dreamliners prior to the recent battery fire incidents
------------correct----------------------
Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner batteries have a bad history, but regulators aren’t sure they are to blame for the latest problems with the airline company’s latest jet.
Japan’s two largest airlines replaced the lithium-ion batteries in their 787s multiple times in the months before two batteries caught fire in flight. One battery was aboard an All Nippon Airways (ANA) jet, while the other was aboard a United Airlines jet.
Reuters reports that both ANA and Japan Airlines released comments that point toward battery reliability issues long before the fires. ANA changed 10 batteries on its Dreamliners last year.
They were not required to inform accident investigators in the US, however, because the incidents didn’t compromise the plane’s safety. JAL spokeswoman Sze Hunn Yap also stated that the company replaced batteries on “a few occasions.”

What are the names of the six granddaughters of Cecil Slaughter and what is unique about their naming
------------correct----------------------
The Six Granddaughters of Cecil Slaughter
Imagine being able to talk from the grave, reflecting on your behavior, your life, and your friends and family. This is the premise of Susan Hahn’s novel about a family of Hungarian Jewish immigrants who settle in Chicago and struggle to make the American dream a reality while still honoring their traditions and ancestors.
One aspect of this honor involves naming the six granddaughters of Cecil Slaughter after their grandfather, in choosing names that echo his: Ceci, Cecilia, Celine, Cecily, Celie, and Celeste. Ceci died as a young adult, and the story is narrated in her voice, speaking from the grave as she watches the antics of her above-ground family members. This is an eerie yet entertaining concept, and the insights she observes are profound and poignant.
“The dead are not necessarily serene,” she says. “We bring with us our unfinished business—our angers about being treated badly, our unfulfilled ambitions, our unrequited longings about love—the innumerable hungers and unresolved issues of the flesh.”
It seems that all the granddaughters—with the exception of Celeste, who died as an infant—are more than a little off-balance. Cecilia is a talented, well-known poet with an obsessive personality, and her dispensation to the dark side only worsens after she is brutally raped. No matter how much she writes, she feels she cannot purge herself of the dirt lef

ro down and $27 per month for 24 months. Unfortunately, no reason was ever given about why the iPhone 5 was removed from the offer.
Still, that’s not say the deal wasn’t a good one for customers looking to walk right into a store and walk out without paying a dime. Not to mention that even with the increased monthly payment, T-Mobile still works out to be cheaper than AT&T or Verizon more often than not. We won’t know till T-Mobile’s next quarterly financials what kind of impact (if any) this sale had on the company’s new subscriber count, but I imagine given the length of time the sale was up for grabs, T-Mobile expected a runaway success.
Take note that with the sales end, the Galaxy S 4 will return to $99 down for a limited time. The offer is good through just about every T-Mobile company-owned channel. T-Mobile is also extending the open-enrollment period for JUMP!, hoping more customers will recognize the “opportunity to join this amazing program.”

What challenges does Rebecca face after becoming immortal thanks to her neighbor Miss Hatfield and what must she do to find a clue about the source of her immortality
------------correct----------------------
In what is fast becoming the Book Flood of Summer 2014, even more exciting books have been turning up in the post and as eARCs…
Featuring: Anna Caltabiano, Orson Scott Card & Aaron Johnston, Richard A. Clarke, James S.A. Corey, Ellen Datlow (ed.), Emma Donohue, Daryl Gregory, Elliott Hall, Doug Hulick, Kameron Hurley, Kendra Leighton, D.J. Molles, Edward St. Aubyns, Liesel Schwarz, Graeme Shimmin, Nalini Singh, James Thornton
Rebecca, a 15-year-old American, isn’t entirely happy with her life, comfortable though it is. Still, even she knows that she shouldn’t talk to strangers. So when her mysterious neighbour Miss Hatfield asked her in for a chat and a drink, Rebecca wasn’t entirely sure why she said yes. It was a decision that was to change everything.
For Miss Hatfield is immortal. And now, thanks to a drop of water from the Fountain of Youth, Rebecca is as well. But this gift might be more of a curse, and it comes with a price. Rebecca is beginning to lose her personality, to take on the aspects of her neighbour. She is becoming the next Miss Hatfield.
But before the process goes too far, Rebecca must travel back in time to turn-of-the-century New York and steal a painting, a picture which might provide a clue to the whereabouts of the source of immortality. A clue which must remain hidden from the world. In order to retrieve the painting, Rebecca must infiltrate a wealthy household, learn more about the head of the family, and find an opportunity to escape. Before her journey is through, she will also have – rather reluctantly – fallen in love. But how can she stay with the boy she cares for, when she must return to her own time before her time-travelling has a fatal effect on her body? And would she rather stay and die in love, or leave and live alone?
And who is the mysterious stranger who shadows her from place to place? A hunter for the secret of immortality – or someone who has already found it?
One of Gollancz’s 2014 debuts, I was very much looking forward to reading this. I’m reading it at the moment and, while interesting and pretty well done, it isn’t really grabbing me… Hopefully it will pick up as I near the end…
Nearly 100 years before the events of Orson Scott Card’s bestselling novel Ender’s Game, humans were just beginning to step off Earth and out into the Solar System. A thin web of ships in both asteroid belts; a few stations; a corporate settlement on Luna. No one had seen any sign of other space-faring races; everyone expected that First Contact, if it came, would happen in the future, in the empty reaches between the stars. Then a young navigator on a distant mining ship saw something moving too fast, heading directly for our sun.
When the alien ship screamed through the solar system, it disrupted communications between the far-flung human mining ships and supply stations, and between them and Earth. So Earth and Luna were unaware that they had been invaded until the ship pulled into Earth orbit, and began landing terra-forming crews in China. Politics and pride slowed the response on Earth, and on Luna, corporate power struggles seemed more urgent than distant deaths. But there are a few men and women who see that if Earth doesn’t wake up and pull together, the planet could be lost.
This is the third volume in Card & Johnston’s The First Formic War series. Sadly, I haven’t read any of the Ender’s Game-related novels, so I’m not sure I’ll get to this in the immediate future. I will, however, be reading Ender’s Game pretty soon.
In Washington, the Kill Committee gathers in the White House’s Situation Room to pick the next targets for the United States drone program. At an airbase just outside Las Vegas, a team of pilots, military personnel and intelligence officers follow through on the committee's orders, finding the men who have been deemed a threat to national security and sentenced to death. On the other side of the world, in the mountains where the drones hunt their prey, someone has decided to fight back. And not just against the unmanned planes that circle their skies, but against the Americans at home who control them.
I’ve read a fair bit of Clarke’s non-fiction, so I’m curious to see what his fiction is like. Hot topic, drones.
The gates have opened the way to thousands of habitable planets, and the land rush has begun. Settlers stream out from humanity's home planets in a vast, poorly controlled flood, landing on a new world. Among them, the Rocinante, haunted by the vast, posthuman network of the protomolecule as they investigate what destroyed the great intergalactic society that built the gates and the protomolecule.
But Holden and his crew must also contend with the growing tensions between the settlers and the company which owns the official claim to the planet. Both sides will stop at nothing to defend what's theirs, but soon a terrible disease strikes and only Holden – with help from the ghostly Detective Miller – can find the cure.
I’m so behind on this series… This is the fourth novel in The Expanse series, yet I’ve only managed to read the first one, Leviathan Wakes. It was recently announced that the TV rights for the series have been bought and (possibly) started development. I’d like to catch up, and I’ll do my best to do so.
This deliciously creepy and loving tribute to the master of modern horror features riveting illustrated stories of his wicked progeny.
In the century since the master of horror, H. P. Lovecraft, published his first story, the monstrosities that crawled out of his brain have become legend: the massive, tentacled Cthulhu, who lurks beneath the sea waiting for his moment to rise; the demon Sultan Azathoth, who lies babbling at the center of the universe, mad beyond imagining; the Deep Ones, who come to shore to breed with mortal men; and the unspeakably-evil Hastur, whose very name brings death. These creatures have been the nightmarish fuel for generations of horror writers, and the inspiration for some of their greatest works.
This impressive anthology celebrates Lovecraft's most famous beasts in all their grotesque glory, with each story a gripping new take on a classic mythos creature and affectionately accompanied by an illuminating illustration. Within these accursed pages something unnatural slouches from the sea into an all-night diner to meet the foolish young woman waiting for him, while the Hounds of Tindalos struggle to survive trapped in human bodies, haunting pool halls for men they can lure into the dark. Strange, haunting, and undeniably monstrous, this is Lovecraft as you have never seen him before.
Sounds like an interesting anthology.
Summer of 1876: San Francisco is in the fierce grip of a record-breaking heat wave and a smallpox epidemic. Through the window of a railroad saloon, a young woman called Jenny Bonnet is shot dead. The survivor, her friend Blanche Beunon, is a French burlesque dancer. Over the next three days, she will risk everything to bring Jenny's murderer to justice – if he doesn’t track her down first. The story Blanche struggles to piece together is one of free-love bohemians, desperate paupers and arrogant millionaires; of jealous men, icy women and damaged children. It’s the secret life of Jenny herself, a notorious character who breaks the law every morning by getting dressed: a charmer as slippery as the frogs she hunts.
In thrilling, cinematic style, FROG MUSIC digs up a long-forgotten, never-solved crime. Full of songs that migrated across the world, Emma Donoghue's lyrical tale of love and bloodshed among lowlifes captures the pulse of a boom town like no other.
Some of my own research touched upon Chinese immigration into San Francisco during this period, so I thought the novel sounded quite interesting.
Harrison was the Monster Detective, a storybook hero. Now he’s in his mid-thirties, and spends most of his time popping pills and not sleeping. Stan became a minor celebrity after being partially eaten by cannibals. Barbara is haunted

In what is fast becoming the Book Flood of Summer 2014, even more exciting books have been turning up in the post and as eARCs…
Featuring: Anna Caltabiano, Orson Scott Card & Aaron Johnston, Richard A. Clarke, James S.A. Corey, Ellen Datlow (ed.), Emma Donohue, Daryl Gregory, Elliott Hall, Doug Hulick, Kameron Hurley, Kendra Leighton, D.J. Molles, Edward St. Aubyns, Liesel Schwarz, Graeme Shimmin, Nalini Singh, James Thornton
Rebecca, a 15-year-old American, isn’t entirely happy with her life, comfortable though it is. Still, even she knows that she shouldn’t talk to strangers. So when her mysterious neighbour Miss Hatfield asked her in for a chat and a drink, Rebecca wasn’t entirely sure why she said yes. It was a decision that was to change everything.
For Miss Hatfield is immortal. And now, thanks to a drop of water from the Fountain of Youth, Rebecca is as well. But this gift might be more of a curse, and it comes with a price. Rebecca is beginning to lose her personality, to take on the aspects of her neighbour. She is becoming the next Miss Hatfield.
But before the process goes too far, Rebecca must travel back in time to turn-of-the-century New York and steal a painting, a picture which might provide a clue to the whereabouts of the source of immortality. A clue which must remain hidden from the world. In order to retrieve the painting, Rebecca must infiltrate a wealthy household, learn more about the head of the family, and find an opportunity to escape. Before her journey is through, she will also have – rather reluctantly – fallen in love. But how can she stay with the boy she cares for, when she must return to her own time before her time-travelling has a fatal effect on her body? And would she rather stay and die in love, or leave and live alone?
And who is the mysterious stranger who shadows her from place to place? A hunter for the secret of immortality – or someone who has already found it?

The Six Granddaughters of Cecil Slaughter
Imagine being able to talk from the grave, reflecting on your behavior, your life, and your friends and family. This is the premise of Susan Hahn’s novel about a family of Hungarian Jewish immigrants who settle in Chicago and struggle to make the American dream a reality while still honoring their traditions and ancestors.
One aspect of this honor involves naming the six granddaughters of Cecil Slaughter after their grandfather, in choosing names that echo his: Ceci, Cecilia, Celine, Cecily, Celie, and Celeste. Ceci died as a young adult, and the story is narrated in her voice, speaking from the grave as she watches the antics of her above-ground family members. This is an eerie yet entertaining concept, and the insights she observes are profound and poignant.
“The dead are not necessarily serene,” she says. “We bring with us our unfinished business—our angers about being treated badly, our unfulfilled ambitions, our unrequited longings about love—the innumerable hungers and unresolved issues of the flesh.”
It seems that all the granddaughters—with the exception of Celeste, who died as an infant—are more than a little off-balance. Cecilia is a talented, well-known poet with an obsessive personality, and her dispensation to the dark side only worsens after she is brutally raped. No matter how much she writes, she feels she cannot purge herself of the dirt lef

What is Jove's approach to planning an event
------------correct----------------------
I really do love the industry I work in. I get to feed my need for all things creative and I get to work with some of the most talented, creative people out there. Not only do I get to learn from these amazing individuals, I get to enjoy their visual creations.
Let me introduce you to my friend Jove. He is the owner and creative director of Jove Meyer Events. He will plan and design your event from start to finish. Jove is creative, friendly and really pays attention to every little detail. His designs are whimsical, thoughtful and fun. I know a lot of planners/designers in this industry so I wanted to know what makes him different from all of the rest…
1. What is your approach to planning an event? My first step is to get to know the client as intimately as possible, ideally over a glass of wine or a cup of coffee. I want to know their intent, their vision and goals for the event. I strive to create authentic experiences by incorporating as much of the clients personal favorites as possible with a touch of my own flair. I approach the planning of an event by making sure I plan details for all five senses (touch, taste, smell, sight and sound) of the event. By touching all five senses the event becomes an experience not to be forgotten!
2. What is your favorite part of the planning process? I love the design aspect of planning an event. Taking in all of the elements and creating a look and feel for the space, transforming things to create memorable

What does the study investigate regarding the relationship between AGNs' optical spectrum and X-ray absorption
------------correct----------------------
It has been observed that approximately 10% to 30% of AGNs show no X-ray absorption, whereas the optical spectrum suggests signi cant obscuration. One possible explanation is that the obscuring medium consists of dense clumps. In the model, using Monte Carlo simulations, I conduct a study to check whether the clumpiness of the torus is a possible reason for the mismatch in optical and X-ray spectrums. For a variety of torus con gurations I have found that there is no mismatch in the number of the clumps intersected between the lines of sight originating in the X-ray and optical

------------question-----------------------
What concerns does the author express about potential government actions during an economic crisis
------------correct----------------------
the media coverage is over the top, "sensationalized," he said. As a reporter I couldn't escape from the news, unlike clients of his whom he advises to just turn off the TV. It was true. I was at Bloomberg with 11 TV monitors in my line of sight.
Wall Street was right in betting that the U.S. wouldn't stop paying interest on its bonds, Benningfield said. I said my worry wasn't just default, but the unexpected consequences of even getting close. In corporate America, that would be called reputational risk. What happens if the government pays creditors but not Social Security recipients?
Benningfield has long experience calming clients who disagree with him. He didn't think my fear was irrational, he said diplomatically. "Markets are not necessarily great at pricing the risk of highly improbable events."
He tried to turn the conversation to something more productive -- not what the future holds but what my actual options were. I could sell my stocks. If I did, what would I do with the money? Ironically, the safest place to be in times of economic stress is usually U.S. government bonds, he said. Yes, that was ironic.
When actual clients call up Benningfield in a panic, his first question is whether they have the means, and the stomach, to weather a volatile market. If you have money in stocks that you need in just a few years, you shouldn't have those assets in stocks anyway, he says. That doesn't apply to me, he observed. With my stocks in a retirement plan I can't touch without penalties for decades, I can take plenty of short-term losses in exchange for long-term gains. My stress is the price long-term investors must pay.
"This is part of the plan," he said. "If the risk goes away, so do the the returns."
Then he told me a story about a surfer. I was watching 11 TVs at the moment and didn't entirely follow, but it seemed a veteran surfer was out off the California coast having a great day, the sun was out, the waves were perfect, all was well and he was bitten by a shark. I stopped watching 11 TVs.
The surfer survived to tell the tale, Benningfield added quickly, drawing this lesson: Some dangers we can see coming. Many we can't. I could exit the market now, only to jump back in when everything looked safe and then "get blindsided." The biggest profits often come to investors when the sharks are circling.
After hanging up with Benningfield, I pulled out my "Stock Trader's Almanac" and confirmed his contention that the market's worst days are often followed by its very best days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average's worst days of 1929 were Oct. 28 and 29, while its best was Oct. 30. Miss out on the losses and you'll probably miss out on the gains.
Benningfield is good at his job. I left my investments alone. But I felt just as anxious as before. More, really. And now I was thinking about sharks and one-legged surfers.
On the next day of the shutdown, the 10th, House Republican leaders floated the idea of lifting the debt limit temporarily. For six weeks. Now it's day 11. Will the deal fall apart, on all 11 TV screens? Even if it's approved, what happens in six weeks? Does this mean the government stays shuttered for even longer, damaging the economy in another unpredictable way?
I don't know. I do know I'm not doing anything stupid in the heat of the moment.
You hear that, Washington

What challenges does Dilly Dally face in establishing their individuality in the music scene
------------correct----------------------
By Michael Grondin
CALGARY — Bands are often painted with the same brush as those used for their influences. This brush can colour interpretations before a group steps on a stage or records a song. Of course, while musical influences undoubtedly play a role in shaping one’s sound, lazily dropping a project in a communal bucket can seriously detract from your potential enjoyment.
Toronto’s Dilly Dally is one such act that is fighting for a semblance of individuality within a heavily saturated music scene. They are constantly slapped with comparisons to the projects past, and though they have been out of high school for some time, they are often framed as high-school friends who started a band and sound like the Pixies.
But what does that really mean? Well, to start, Dilly Dally are a band that have been busting ass and hustling to make things work. According to lead vocalist and guitarist Katie Monks, the project has come a long way since her and Dilly Dally co-member Liz Ball’s adolescent experimentation with music.
“This band didn’t start in high school. Me and Liz met each other in high-school, but we’re 26 now and we’ve been slugging it out in the city for six years, and we’ve been working shitty jobs and doing what all the other bands here are doing to make it work,” says Monks in a phone interview from Toronto.
Immersing themselves in the local music scene of Toronto is a huge aspect of what shaped Dilly Dally’s direction up to this point.
“It’s something we’ve been working on for a really long time. To me, this project was born out of the music we were listening to here in Toronto, and a lot of the bands here were a big part of that,” she says. “There was, and is, a lot of live music happening, and

My memory is sketchy about this but I'll tell you what I remember. Craig and I were friends at SHS and talked about our aspirations for careers in military aviation. Craig went to the Naval Academy out of high school and we did our best to stay in touch. I saw him twice during our post-SHS years. The first time was when we met under the north goalpost at Soldier Field in Chicago after the AF-Navy game in 1968 and we had a brief opportunity to catch up with each other. In 1970, I was a guest of Craig's at the USNA for a weekend, attended a formal ball with him that Saturday night and had the opportunity to meet his future bride-to-be. In '73 or '74 I was in Germany in the armed forces and was told that I had a message in the base communications center. I don't know how she tracked me down, but Craig's wife had sent me a communication through military channels informing me of Craig's unfortunate death. He died in an aircraft accident, a night instrument flight out of Lemoore Naval Air Station, CA, flying the A-4 Skyhawk. I know no other details and there was no contact information for his widow. Craig was a patriot, a fine person, and a good friend. I will always remember him fondly as I do other fallen warriors who have tragically lost their lives in defense of this great nation of ours.

My memory is sketchy about this but I'll tell you what I remember. Craig and I were friends at SHS and talked about our aspirations for careers in military aviation. Craig went to the Naval Academy out of high school and we did our best to stay in touch. I saw him twice during our post-SHS years. The first time was when we met under the north goalpost at Soldier Field in Chicago after the AF-Navy game in 1968 and we had a brief opportunity to catch up with each other. In 1970, I was a guest of Craig's at the USNA for a weekend, attended a formal ball with him that Saturday night and had the opportunity to meet his future bride-to-be. In '73 or '74 I was in Germany in the armed forces and was told that I had a message in the base communications center. I don't know how she tracked me down, but Craig's wife had sent me a communication through military channels informing me of Craig's unfortunate death. He died in an aircraft accident, a night instrument flight out of Lemoore Naval Air Station, CA, flying the A-4 Skyhawk. I know no other details and there was no contact information for his widow. Craig was a patriot, a fine person, and a good friend. I will always remember him fondly as I do other fallen warriors who have tragically lost their lives in defense of this great nation of ours.

I’m behind, missing Day 32. In writing, not the yoga. Well, let me change that. I missed Day 31 of yoga, so I am more behind than I thought. And let me say that skipping one day of yoga practice, now feels like a very long time!
But as the story goes….. an interesting thing happened along the way.
No yoga on Thursday. Friday, done!
Saturday…. and class wasn’t until 9:30am so I had a long time to think about the practice ahead. A long time to build some expectations – or not.
My yoga practice goes up and down, forward and backward with regards to how I feel about it, progress, what I expect to get out of it. Saturday I was at a point of surrender. You know, feeling like it doesn’t matter what the heck I do or what progress I make, all I really want is to get on my mat and move a little.
Why is it we think we have to get somewhere? Make progress? Go a little further? Do a little more? It isn’t what yoga is supposed to be about. For me, it is supposed to be doing something I love. Keeping my body moving and healthy. Building awareness and focus. Learning to be calm, still and peaceful. That is my yoga. So why the continual need in the back of my mind that it has to improve?
I went to class ready to accept it, wherever it was today. I discussed my somewhat problematic SI joint with the teacher and said I was going to take it easy, try to bring some awareness into what might be causing me the joint problem. If I stopped doing a pose, or opted out, she would know why.
I love this teacher’s classes. Always new and fresh and well paced. We begin. A vinyasa class, building heat

What happened to the iPhone 5 in T-Mobile's initial offer
------------correct----------------------
ro down and $27 per month for 24 months. Unfortunately, no reason was ever given about why the iPhone 5 was removed from the offer.
Still, that’s not say the deal wasn’t a good one for customers looking to walk right into a store and walk out without paying a dime. Not to mention that even with the increased monthly payment, T-Mobile still works out to be cheaper than AT&T or Verizon more often than not. We won’t know till T-Mobile’s next quarterly financials what kind of impact (if any) this sale had on the company’s new subscriber count, but I imagine given the length of time the sale was up for grabs, T-Mobile expected a runaway success.
Take note that with the sales end, the Galaxy S 4 will return to $99 down for a limited time. The offer is good through just about every T-Mobile company-owned channel. T-Mobile is also extending the open-enrollment period for JUMP!, hoping more customers will recognize the “opportunity to join this amazing program.”

------------question-----------------------
What is the purpose of a living will and how should it reflect an individual's preferences regarding medical care
------------correct----------------------
unger people. In a living will, you can give your family members and doctors instructions about your desired medical care, in case you become incapacitated (comatose or brain-dead, for example) and can't tell them yourself. Some people say that they would not want to be kept alive by artificial means if they are in a vegetative state, and there's no chance of recovery. If this is you, that's definitely something to include in a living will. Of course, if you would prefer the opposite, being kept alive as long as is medically possible, you can put that in your living will, as well.
Power of Attorney: Power of attorney allows you to grant someone else (normally a trusted family member or friend) the power to make certain decisions in your place, with the same legal effect as if you had made them yourself, in the event that you become unable to do so (normally due to mental or physical incapacity). If you decide to give someone power of attorney, you should make your wishes known to them in advance, so they are more likely to make the same decisions that you would make, if you were able to. And, of course, you should only give this authority to someone with whom you would trust your life because that is, in some cases, just what you're doing.
Funeral Arrangements: You should make it very clear to the people handling your funeral what type of funeral you want, and what you want done with your body. You should not put these instructions in your will, because wills are commonly not read until days or weeks after the testator dies, by which point it may be too late to give their wishes on this subject effect.

What concerns were raised about the management of Hinchingbrooke by Circle
------------correct----------------------
faction with their health service is significantly higher than here.
Defending the introduction of private sector practices into the public health service, Mr Parsa said: "The British economy is losing £170 billion a year. If a company came in and said, 'I can save all that money for the British taxpayer and in return I want 10%', I would do that deal as a taxpayer, any day. That's the deal we did with the NHS."
– Ali Parsa, Chief executive of Circle
"I think we need to take private/public, the ideology, out of the health service and let the NHS provide free at the point of delivery care."
Karen Jennings, assistant general secretary of Unison, told Today: "Unison challenged the notion that Circle should take over Hinchingbrooke, but they are now managing it and we are working with them.
"I think it's right that Hinchingbrooke celebrates these very, very early successes, but I do need to point out that one of the ways that they started to save money - and this was one of our fears - was that through newly negotiated contracts with outsourced cleaning services, they have made cuts.
"That means that there's going to be cuts in cleaning staff, a vital and critical group of staff to ensure that there's no cross-infection at the hospital. These are very, very early signs of concerns we had about a private management firm taking over.

t behind on her body by the man she calls Herr M., her rapist.
Celie, just as off-balanced but in a different way, works in a boutique frequented by “educated, rich, bored, frustrated, freaky-thin women who are dismayed that they have wound up being such clichés.” Celie makes her customers feel hopeful—“that the next item she brings them to try on will most certainly reinvent them. That suddenly they will see themselves in the mirror as they want to be seen.”
Statements like these pepper the novel and are easily applied to a reader’s personal experience, which makes them all the more entertaining, relevant, and insightful.
At times it can be difficult to follow the various characters because of the closeness of their names and the depth with which Hahn delves into the past and present circumstances that have shaped each one. But the author is a masterful storyteller and her tale, given its movement between those living and those dead, is unique and intriguing.

How to Handle a Debt Default. You Know. Just in Case.
On the ninth day of Shutdown I started to freak out.
Should I sell my stocks? What do I buy? I pictured my portfolio trashed, me without a job, my 60-something parents' retirement delayed, the economy in chaos. The misery of 2008 and 2009, only worse.
This wasn't like me. I'm an experienced personal finance reporter in my 30s who has absorbed, and given, many a lecture on staying calm in the face of fear. Now, at least in the investment world, I couldn't seem to find anybody as agitated as I was, and that was agitating me. The stock market sits complacently near an all-time high. Where were my angsters-in-arms? I even got a pitch from a public relations firm letting me know of a financial adviser who could comment on "how to handle a government default."
How to handle a government default?
While my head was filling with apocalyptic visions, Wall Street and Washington seemed to expect a last-minute deal. My worry was that the last minute would be too late, crushing our reputation as a haven, already shaken in 2011's near-default. The U.S. Treasury might be able to avoid default without Congress's approval, but not without sparking a deep recession.
In 2007 and 2008, I interviewed more than a happy few economists and strategists who kept saying it was going to be fine. Just before I took a long and poorly timed vacation in September of 2008, I wrote a blog post quoting three distinguished experts who thought stocks had hit bottom. "When people make predictions about this stock market," I wrote, "I don't know whether to congratulate them for their boldness or question their sanity."
Now I know.
That crisis actually benefited me, in a way. I held on to my job and diligently saved more in my 401(k) plan. Today I feel flush after the S&P 500's 150 percent rise since the market bottom in March 2009.
And that means I have more to lose.
I IM'd my friend Mark, a finance nerd.
Me: Hey curious what you think: are you worried about default?
Me: cause I'm terrified
Mark: I just wish I had more cash on hand to invest in case it does.
This was reassuring, kind of. Maybe there would be an upside to any chaos.
Mark: The U.S. will lose its dominance with or without a default.
Mark: Gold & bitcoins are probably the only other assets to compete [with Treasuries]
Should I have more cash around to take advantage of market panic? Was the financial system so precarious that Bitcoins, the investment du jour of drug smugglers and money launderers, could make a comeback? Should I be building a bunker in my basement and stocking it with the vegetarian equivalent of Spam? Is there a vegetarian equivalent of Spam? Throw in a few gold bars? Actually pay attention to libertarians?
I would call Milo. That's what I would do. I would call Milo.
In previous crises, when I needed a quote from a voice of reason, I often reached out to Milo Benningfield of Benningfield Financial Advisors in San Francisco. Now, on the phone, he sounded relaxed.
He admitted to feeling a bit of gut-tightening after reading the same articles that I had. "It was kind of like watching a trailer for a summer blockbuster," conjuring up economic horrors like worldwide depression in place of exploding cities and Zombie apocalypse, he said. But he wasn’t freaking out. Like most blockbuster movies,

Albert Bell from Malta plays in local bands Forsaken, Nomad Son, and Albert Bell’s Sacro Sanctus at the moment, while organising Malta Doom Metal Festival as well. Guido Segers caught up with Albert for a long chat to find out more.
Rudra from Signapore play unique sounding Vedic metal music. Blending thrash, death and black metal with folk elements to create a unique sound from their small city state in Southeast Asia. Guido Segers talks to singer/bassist Kathir to find out more.
Guido Segers talks to singer Nefas and guitar player Kozeljnik from The Stone, who hails from Serbia and started out in 1996, in the wake of the black metal boom.
Guido Segers caught up with Grimrik, one of the pioneers in the dungeon synth genre, to discuss the genre a bit more, thereby providing a good starting point for people new to this musicical genre.
1914 is a Ukraine based metal band influenced by World War I, or the Great War. Guido Segers caught up with Dmytro Kumar from the band to find out more.
Guido Segers asked Fabio Lione from Italian powermetal band Rhapsody about the highlights of their career and their upcoming farewell tour.
Guido Segers caught up with Sen Fang from Chinese metal band Black Kirin, to find out more about what it’s like to be a metal band in China.
Just across the Russian border though, a small scene has been brewing in Karelia. A prominent band in these parts is СатанаКозёл, which translates as SatanaKozel (Satan’s Goat). Guido Segers caught up with drummer drummer Nickolai Kuskov to find out more.
Guido Segers caught up with “horror film freaks who love to play crazy rock’n’roll” Possessor from London.
What I particularly like is how the abstract lyrics work very well for the theme of the record, the seasonal changes. This also helps in bringing folk music closer to the roots, since most of these old songs would have been highly ritualistic and bound up with traditions.

The chief executive of the first private company to take charge of an NHS district general hospital, in Cambridgeshire, has said he would like to see the model extended across the health service in England.
Six months after Circle took over the struggling Hinchingbrooke Hospital Trust in Huntingdon, it has become "one of the best in the country" for quality and is on course to balance its books financially next year, said Ali Parsa. But health union Unison warned that the company's arrival has led to a cut in cleaning and increased job insecurity for staff, which could be detrimental to patient care.
Circle needs a surplus of £70 million over the next 10 years to make a profit at Hinchingbrooke, but Mr Parsa said this would only happen after the hospital's projected losses of £230 million are eliminated.
The Circle model, under which the company is "co-owned" by its workers and clinicians are given decision-making powers within the hospital, should "absolutely" be extended more widely across the NHS, he said. Asked if Circle would like to run more NHS hospitals, he replied: "We would love it."
Mr Parsa told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "We believe our partners - doctors, nurses, healthcare professionals - should run their own hospitals. Look at Germany, where private companies run more hospitals than government does and satis

What is the ongoing struggle faced by Drothe in the story besides his rising position in the underworld
------------correct----------------------
p my street). I’ll be getting to this hopefully very soon, after I get my review of Speed of Dark ready. The First Stone is the first in a trilogy, so hopefully I’ll like this one and have more to read! The rest of the series includes The Fall (a prequel short story), The Rapture and The Children’s Crusade. I just bought the prequel, so I’ll slot that in before starting this.
It’s been three months since Drothe killed a legend, burned down a portion of the imperial capital, and unexpectedly elevated himself into the ranks of the criminal elite. Now, as the newest Gray Prince in the underworld, he’s learning just how good he used to have it.
With barely the beginnings of an organization to his name, Drothe is already being called out by other Gray Princes. And to make matters worse, when one dies, all signs point to Drothe as wielding the knife. As members of the Kin begin choosing sides – mostly against him – for what looks to be another impending war, Drothe is approached by a man who not only has the solution to Drothe’s most pressing problem, but an offer of redemption. The only problem is the offer isn’t for him.
Now Drothe finds himself on the way to the Despotate of Djan, the empire’s long-standing enemy, with an offer to make and a price on his head. And the grains of sand in the hour glass are running out, fast...

On the eve of a recurring catastrophic event known to extinguish nations and reshape continents, a troubled orphan evades death and slavery to uncover her own bloody past… while a world goes to war with itself.
In the frozen kingdom of Saiduan, invaders from another realm are decimating whole cities, leaving behind nothing but ash and ruin.
As the dark star of the cataclysm rises, an illegitimate ruler is tasked with holding together a country fractured by civil war, a precocious young fighter is asked to betray his family and a half-Dhai general must choose between the eradication of her father’s people or loyalty to her alien Empress.
Through tense alliances and devastating betrayal, the Dhai and their allies attempt to hold against a seemingly unstoppable force as enemy nations prepare for a coming together of worlds as old as the universe itself.
In the end, one world will rise – and many will perish.

I’ve mentioned this novel a few times on the blog, recently. It sounds really interesting. The publicity material makes a big deal out of the fact that the novel is inspired by Alfred Noyes’s The Highwayman. Before reading the synopsis for this novel, I had never heard of that story, so I’m not sure I’ll be able to comment on that aspect, when I get around to reviewing this. I recently sent interview questions to Kendra, so expect that to go up mid-June. [Full disclosure: Kendra and I are friends from undergrad.]
In a steel-and-lead encased bunker a Special Forces soldier wait on his final orders.
On the surface a bacterium has turned 90% of the population into hyper-aggressive predators.
Now Captain Lee Harden must leave the bunker and venture into the wasteland to rekindle a shattered America.
I do like post-apocalyptic novels. This was a self-published success before Orbit picked up the series. Hopeful it’ll be entertaining, and better than the Ex-Heroes series, which was another move-to-big-publisher zombie series that I… did not like much. This printed edition also includes the novella, “An Empty Soul” (not, as the back cover copy suggests, “Faith”).
The judges on the panel of the Elysian Prize for Literature must get through hundreds of submissions to find the best book of the year. Meanwhile, a host of writers are desperate for Elysian attention: the brilliant writer and serial heartbreaker Katherine Burns; the lovelorn debut novelist Sam Black; and Bunjee, convinced that his magnum opus,The Mulberry Elephant, will take the literary world by storm. Things go terribly wrong when Katherine’s publisher accidentally submits a cookery book in place of her novel; one of the judges finds himself in the middle of a scandal; and Bunjee, aghast to learn his book isn’t on the short list, seeks revenge.
Lost for Words is a witty, fabulously entertaining satire that cuts to the quick of some of the deepest questions about the place of art in our celebrity-obsessed culture, and asks how we can ever hope to recognize real talent when everyone has an agenda.
I’m almost finished, actually. It’s pretty good, too. Imagine everything you don’t like about publishing, literary society, and the most annoying denizens that inhabit it. Then make fun of them in a clever, wry manner. Short review coming soon (it doesn’t need a long one).
Liesel Schwartz, A Clockwork Heart & Sky Pirates (Del Rey UK)
FOR BETTER OR CURSE. That might as well have been the wedding vow of Elle Chance and her new husband, the ex-Warlock Hugh Marsh in the second book of this edgy new series that transforms elements of urban fantasy, historical adventure, and paranormal romance into storytelling magic.
As Elle devotes herself to her duties as the Oracle – who alone has the power to keep the dark designs of Shadow at bay – Marsh finds himself missing the excitement of his former life as a Warlock. So when Commissioner Willoughby of the London Metropolitan police seeks his help in solving a magical mystery, Marsh is only too happy to oblige. But in doing so, Marsh loses his heart… literally.
In place of the flesh-and-blood organ is a clockwork device – a device that makes Marsh a kind of zombie. Nor is he the only one. A plague of clockwork zombies is afflicting London, sowing panic and whispers of revolution. Now Elle must join forces with her husband’s old friend, the Nightwalker Loisa Beladodia, to track down Marsh’s heart and restore it to his chest before time runs out.
I met Liesel Schwartz at a signing for her debut novel (the first in this series). Sadly, I haven’t got around to reading that novel, yet… Sigh. So many books, so very little time to get through them all…

“I don’t like killing, but I’m good at it. Murder isn’t so bad from a distance, just shapes in my scope. Close up work though, the garrotte around the neck, the knife in the heart, it’s not for me. Too much empathy, that’s my problem. Usually. But not today. Today is different…”
The year is 1955 and something is very wrong with the world: Churchill is dead and WW2 didn't happen. Europe is in thrall to a nuclear-armed Nazi Germany. Only Britain and its Empire holds out, bound by an uneasy truce and all the while German scientists are experimenting with terrifying forces beyond their understanding - forces that are driving them to the brink of insanity and beyond.
Berlin is a hotbed of suspicion and betrayal – a lone British assassin is fighting a private war with the Nazis; the Gestapo are on the trail of a beautiful young resistance fighter and the head of the SS plots to dispose of an increasingly decrepit Adolf Hitler and become Fuhrer. While in London, a sinister and treacherous cabal will stop at nothing to conceal the conspiracy of the century.
Four desperate scenarios that are destined to collide with catastrophic effect. And it all hinges on a single kill in the morning…
Never heard of this before it arrived in the mail. Sounds kind of interesting, too.
Assassin. Soldier. Arrow. That is who Vasic is, who he will always be.

To stop the wave of death, Vasic must complete the simplest and most difficult mission of his life.

I’ve mentioned this novel a few times on the blog, recently. It sounds really interesting. The publicity material makes a big deal out of the fact that the novel is inspired by Alfred Noyes’s The Highwayman. Before reading the synopsis for this novel, I had never heard of that story, so I’m not sure I’ll be able to comment on that aspect, when I get around to reviewing this. I recently sent interview questions to Kendra, so expect that to go up mid-June. [Full disclosure: Kendra and I are friends from undergrad.]
In a steel-and-lead encased bunker a Special Forces soldier wait on his final orders.
On the surface a bacterium has turned 90% of the population into hyper-aggressive predators.
Now Captain Lee Harden must leave the bunker and venture into the wasteland to rekindle a shattered America.
I do like post-apocalyptic novels. This was a self-published success before Orbit picked up the series. Hopeful it’ll be entertaining, and better than the Ex-Heroes series, which was another move-to-big-publisher zombie series that I… did not like much. This printed edition also includes the novella, “An Empty Soul” (not, as the back cover copy suggests, “Faith”).
The judges on the panel of the Elysian Prize for Literature must get through hundreds of submissions to find the best book of the year. Meanwhile, a host of writers are desperate for Elysian attention: the brilliant writer and serial heartbreaker Katherine Burns; the lovelorn debut novelist Sam Black; and Bunjee, convinced that his magnum opus,The Mulberry Elephant, will take the literary world by storm. Things go terribly wrong when Katherine’s publisher accidentally submits a cookery book in place of her novel; one of the judges finds himself in the middle of a scandal; and Bunjee, aghast to learn his book isn’t on the short list, seeks revenge.
Lost for Words is a witty, fabulously entertaining satire that cuts to the quick of some of the deepest questions about the place of art in our celebrity-obsessed culture, and asks how we can ever hope to recognize real talent when everyone has an agenda.
I’m almost finished, actually. It’s pretty good, too. Imagine everything you don’t like about publishing, literary society, and the most annoying denizens that inhabit it. Then make fun of them in a clever, wry manner. Short review coming soon (it doesn’t need a long one).
Liesel Schwartz, A Clockwork Heart & Sky Pirates (Del Rey UK)
FOR BETTER OR CURSE. That might as well have been the wedding vow of Elle Chance and her new husband, the ex-Warlock Hugh Marsh in the second book of this edgy new series that transforms elements of urban fantasy, historical adventure, and paranormal romance into storytelling magic.
As Elle devotes herself to her duties as the Oracle – who alone has the power to keep the dark designs of Shadow at bay – Marsh finds himself missing the excitement of his former life as a Warlock. So when Commissioner Willoughby of the London Metropolitan police seeks his help in solving a magical mystery, Marsh is only too happy to oblige. But in doing so, Marsh loses his heart… literally.
In place of the flesh-and-blood organ is a clockwork device – a device that makes Marsh a kind of zombie. Nor is he the only one. A plague of clockwork zombies is afflicting London, sowing panic and whispers of revolution. Now Elle must join forces with her husband’s old friend, the Nightwalker Loisa Beladodia, to track down Marsh’s heart and restore it to his chest before time runs out.
I met Liesel Schwartz at a signing for her debut novel (the first in this series). Sadly, I haven’t got around to reading that novel, yet… Sigh. So many books, so very little time to get through them all…

“I don’t like killing, but I’m good at it. Murder isn’t so bad from a distance, just shapes in my scope. Close up work though, the garrotte around the neck, the knife in the heart, it’s not for me. Too much empathy, that’s my problem. Usually. But not today. Today is different…”
The year is 1955 and something is very wrong with the world: Churchill is dead and WW2 didn't happen. Europe is in thrall to a nuclear-armed Nazi Germany. Only Britain and its Empire holds out, bound by an uneasy truce and all the while German scientists are experimenting with terrifying forces beyond their understanding - forces that are driving them to the brink of insanity and beyond.
Berlin is a hotbed of suspicion and betrayal – a lone British assassin is fighting a private war with the Nazis; the Gestapo are on the trail of a beautiful young resistance fighter and the head of the SS plots to dispose of an increasingly decrepit Adolf Hitler and become Fuhrer. While in London, a sinister and treacherous cabal will stop at nothing to conceal the conspiracy of the century.
Four desperate scenarios that are destined to collide with catastrophic effect. And it all hinges on a single kill in the morning…
Never heard of this before it arrived in the mail. Sounds kind of interesting, too.
Assassin. Soldier. Arrow. That is who Vasic is, who he will always be. His soul drenched in blood, his conscience heavy with the weight of all he's done, he exists in the shadows, far from the hope his people can almost touch – if only they do not first drown in the murderous insanity of a lethal contagion. To stop the wave of death, Vasic must complete the simplest and most difficult mission of his life.
For if the Psy race is to survive, the empaths must wake…

p my street). I’ll be getting to this hopefully very soon, after I get my review of Speed of Dark ready. The First Stone is the first in a trilogy, so hopefully I’ll like this one and have more to read! The rest of the series includes The Fall (a prequel short story), The Rapture and The Children’s Crusade. I just bought the prequel, so I’ll slot that in before starting this.
It’s been three months since Drothe killed a legend, burned down a portion of the imperial capital, and unexpectedly elevated himself into the ranks of the criminal elite. Now, as the newest Gray Prince in the underworld, he’s learning just how good he used to have it.
With barely the beginnings of an organization to his name, Drothe is already being called out by other Gray Princes. And to make matters worse, when one dies, all signs point to Drothe as wielding the knife. As members of the Kin begin choosing sides – mostly against him – for what looks to be another impending war, Drothe is approached by a man who not only has the solution to Drothe’s most pressing problem, but an offer of redemption. The only problem is the offer isn’t for him.
Now Drothe finds himself on the way to the Despotate of Djan, the empire’s long-standing enemy, with an offer to make and a price on his head. And the grains of sand in the hour glass are running out, fast...
Loved the first book, very glad this one has finally arrived!

On the eve of a recurring catastrophic event known to extinguish nations and reshape continents, a troubled orphan evades death and slavery to uncover her own bloody past… while a world goes to war with itself.
In the frozen kingdom of Saiduan, invaders from another realm are decimating whole cities, leaving behind nothing but ash and ruin.
As the dark star of the cataclysm rises, an illegitimate ruler is tasked with holding together a country fractured by civil war, a precocious young fighter is asked to betray his family and a half-Dhai general must choose between the eradication of her father’s people or loyalty to her alien Empress.
Through tense alliances and devastating betrayal, the Dhai and their allies attempt to hold against a seemingly unstoppable force as enemy nations prepare for a coming together of worlds as old as the universe itself.
In the end, one world will rise – and many will perish.
I’ve mentioned this before on the blog. Will get to it pretty soon.

I’ve mentioned this novel a few times on the blog, recently. It sounds really interesting. The publicity material makes a big deal out of the fact that the novel is inspired by Alfred Noyes’s The Highwayman. Before reading the synopsis for this novel, I had never heard of that story, so I’m not sure I’ll be able to comment on that aspect, when I get around to reviewing this. I recently sent interview questions to Kendra, so expect that to go up mid-June. [Full disclosure: Kendra and I are friends from undergrad.]
In a steel-and-lead encased bunker a Special Forces soldier wait on his final orders.
On the surface a bacterium has turned 90% of the population into hyper-aggressive predators.
Now Captain Lee Harden must leave the bunker and venture into the wasteland to rekindle a shattered America.
I do like post-apocalyptic novels. This was a self-published success before Orbit picked up the series. Hopeful it’ll be entertaining, and better than the Ex-Heroes series, which was another move-to-big-publisher zombie series that I… did not like much. This printed edition also includes the novella, “An Empty Soul” (not, as the back cover copy suggests, “Faith”).
The judges on the panel of the Elysian Prize for Literature must get through hundreds of submissions to find the best book of the year. Meanwhile, a host of writers are desperate for Elysian attention: the brilliant writer and serial heartbreaker Katherine Burns; the lovelorn debut novelist Sam Black; and Bunjee, convinced that his magnum opus,The Mulberry Elephant, will take the literary world by storm. Things go terribly wrong when Katherine’s publisher accidentally submits a cookery book in place of her novel; one of the judges finds himself in the middle of a scandal; and Bunjee, aghast to learn his book isn’t on the short list, seeks revenge.
Lost for Words is a witty, fabulously entertaining satire that cuts to the quick of some of the deepest questions about the place of art in our celebrity-obsessed culture, and asks how we can ever hope to recognize real talent when everyone has an agenda.
I’m almost finished, actually. It’s pretty good, too. Imagine everything you don’t like about publishing, literary society, and the most annoying denizens that inhabit it. Then make fun of them in a clever, wry manner. Short review coming soon (it doesn’t need a long one).
Liesel Schwartz, A Clockwork Heart & Sky Pirates (Del Rey UK)
FOR BETTER OR CURSE. That might as well have been the wedding vow of Elle Chance and her new husband, the ex-Warlock Hugh Marsh in the second book of this edgy new series that transforms elements of urban fantasy, historical adventure, and paranormal romance into storytelling magic.
As Elle devotes herself to her duties as the Oracle – who alone has the power to keep the dark designs of Shadow at bay – Marsh finds himself missing the excitement of his former life as a Warlock. So when Commissioner Willoughby of the London Metropolitan police seeks his help in solving a magical mystery, Marsh is only too happy to oblige. But in doing so, Marsh loses his heart… literally.
In place of the flesh-and-blood organ is a clockwork device – a device that makes Marsh a kind of zombie. Nor is he the only one. A plague of clockwork zombies is afflicting London, sowing panic and whispers of revolution. Now Elle must join forces with her husband’s old friend, the Nightwalker Loisa Beladodia, to track down Marsh’s heart and restore it to his chest before time runs out.
I met Liesel Schwartz at a signing for her debut novel (the first in this series). Sadly, I haven’t got around to reading that novel, yet… Sigh. So many books, so very little time to get through them all…
Also on CR: Interview with Liesel Schwarz
“I don’t like killing, but I’m good at it. Murder isn’t so bad from a distance, just shapes in my scope. Close up work though, the garrotte around the neck, the knife in the heart, it’s not for me. Too much empathy, that’s my problem. Usually. But not today. Today is different…”
The year is 1955 and something is very wrong with the world: Churchill is dead and WW2 didn't happen. Europe is in thrall to a nuclear-armed Nazi Germany. Only Britain and its Empire holds out, bound by an uneasy truce and all the while German scientists are experimenting with terrifying forces beyond their understanding - forces that are driving them to the brink of insanity and beyond.
Berlin is a hotbed of suspicion and betrayal – a lone British assassin is fighting a private war with the Nazis; the Gestapo are on the trail of a beautiful young resistance fighter and the head of the SS plots to dispose of an increasingly decrepit Adolf Hitler and become Fuhrer. While in London, a sinister and treacherous cabal will stop at nothing to conceal the conspiracy of the century.
Four desperate scenarios that are destined to collide with catastrophic effect. And it all hinges on a single kill in the morning…
Never heard of this before it arrived in the mail. Sounds kind of interesting, too.
Assassin. Soldier. Arrow. That is who Vasic is, who he will always be. His soul drenched in blood, his conscience heavy with the weight of all he's done, he exists in the shadows, far from the hope his people can almost touch – if only they do not first drown in the murderous insanity of a lethal contagion. To stop the wave of death, Vasic must complete the simplest and most difficult mission of his life.
For if the Psy race is to survive, the empaths must wake…

e officials investigating the melted ANA Dreamliner battery have concluded that there were no problems inside the battery due to its manufacturing.
Al Jazeera notes that Shigeru Takano, director of the Civil Aviation Bureau’s air transport safety unit, stated:
“There were several reports on quality control issues, but there was nothing that would have caused an immediate problem inside the battery.”
US aviation safety regulators also stated on Sunday that their initial investigation uncovered “no obvious anomalies” in the battery from the United fire.
The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is the first aircraft to use the lithium-ion battery for back-up and auxiliary power. Airbus, who previously warned against using the type of battery, plans to use it in its upcoming A350 jet.
The Dreamliner’s battery problem has kept Boeing’s newest aircraft grounded around the world

According the The Hollywood Reporter, Adim was “convicted of indecent assault and battery for groping and assaulting an adult female on a harbor cruise ship, according to a statement from the Suffolk County District Attorney’s office.” He has been sentenced to one year in a house of correction.
Warner Bros., the studio which produces the hit ABC show, released a statement last night:

What paradoxes of life does the author discuss in relation to modern communication and relationships
------------correct----------------------
This week, I was struck by the paradoxes of life. We carry smart phones so that we can download apps in order to see what is going on in our homes while we are away, yet we are too busy to talk to our spouses and children about what is going on in their lives. We carry cell phones so that we can stay connected to people, yet we are too busy to all sit down at a dinner table together and truly communicate. We crave a sense of community, but are too busy to foster relationships. In an effort to fill that void, we turn to illicit romances instead of honoring sensuality and celibacy. Ah....but this is a duality, you might claim. Is it?
Christopher West, in his newest release, At the Heart of the Gospel, gives a detailed and authoritative teaching...the Catholic response to the duality of the body and soul.

it’s going to shows religiously, and meeting people that has allowed us to cultivate our sound.”
Though they’ve aged beyond adolescence, their approach to music is still full of an energy and curiosity you can find in any basement teenage jam session. However, their precision and attitude speaks volumes, pummeling your eardrums. Fitting then, that they’ve released their first full-length album, Sore, on October 9th via Partisan Records. The 11-song powerhouse of gritty punk rock and wall-of-sound rock ‘n’ roll was produced in a frantic, yet fun 11 days. Ball and Monks are joined on the recording by Jimmy Tony (bass) and Benjamin Reinhartz (drums), giving Dilly Dally a full sound fraught with desire and desperation. Sore projects feminist ideals and healthy rage, wrapped in a twisted, black bubblegum package.
“What affects me about the album is all of the work that everyone else did, you know? Writing up the thank-you
“A record at the end of the day, a band at the end of the day is just a huge collaboration with a bunch of people. You need to have friends and you need to have people that believe in you.”
Monks is excited for what’s coming next for the burgeoning project.
“We don’t want to repeat history. What we’re trying to do is carve out our own place for Dilly Dally,” she says, cognizant of the Pixies comparisons.
“We’re big fans of a lot of shit, and there’s nods and references throughout the record but when people hear the it they’ll find references but they’ll also find pieces of who we are and what we want to bring to music.”
Dilly Dally will be playing The Good Will in Winnipeg on October 23 and Broken City in Calgary on October 25.AB, Alberta, Broken City, Dilly Dally, Manitoba, MB, The Good Will

and sweat and getting the old heart pumping. Then slowly she leads us into to some balances.
First it was crow, or crane pose.
I often have a hard time with this, but particularly when your knees are supposed to be up almost into your armpits. For whatever reason, it is difficult. But doing so with my knees back a little, balanced on the backs of my upper arms like in the picture above, it is easier. I focus. Lift my last foot up a couple times. Maybe lifting my last toe off the ground for a second or two. Then focus one more time …. and I must have held the pose, balanced, for about 30 seconds. Longer than ever before. How did that happen?
On to more seated poses, working towards another opportunity for a balance.
Laughable this one. Me, lifting my entire weight from a seated position and balancing. Not going to happen. Never has. But, what the heck……. I’m up! Now, the other side. Again, I’m up! I am up off the ground!
Another lesson. Like I haven’t been presented with this one a few times over.
When I give it up. When I surrender. When it doesn’t matter whether I can…. or cannot, it just comes. Not without work or focus or determination. But it seems like when I’m not searching for or expecting a particular outcome, it just happens.
And not that achieving either of these is a big deal after. Tomorrow they may not happen again. Does it even matter? Only so much that I recognize that it isn’t important to achieve either, but that I’m willing to work and willing to be with whatever happens.
In yoga class. In life.

3. Any fun trends that you are embracing this season? This season I am all about color blocking flowers, using single flower types and using unique vessels for vases. I love using vases of various shapes, sizes and textures and filling them with only one type of flower, a single stem when possible! Then I place the various single flower arrangements together to create a visually beautiful look! Its simple, chic and elegant!
Jove in his own words…
I have been planning events since I was a kid. Starting with family holiday parties and birthdays I would decorate the house with whatever I could find or make! My first job in high school was in an event company where I learned all about balloons and flowers. We designed and planned events of all shapes and sizes for Disney, Walmart, Dave and Busters and many others.
I officially started my own company after planning my best friends wedding in 2007. She called me one day and said she could not think of anyone better to do it, I was honored and fond myself loving every moment of the process and knew this was what I wanted to do with my life!
My company was born out of a passion for event and wedding planning! We are a boutique event planning company based out of New York City and we provide full service planning, partial planning as well as month of / day of wedding coordination

What realization does the author come to about success in yoga poses and life
------------correct----------------------
and sweat and getting the old heart pumping. Then slowly she leads us into to some balances.
First it was crow, or crane pose.
I often have a hard time with this, but particularly when your knees are supposed to be up almost into your armpits. For whatever reason, it is difficult. But doing so with my knees back a little, balanced on the backs of my upper arms like in the picture above, it is easier. I focus. Lift my last foot up a couple times. Maybe lifting my last toe off the ground for a second or two. Then focus one more time …. and I must have held the pose, balanced, for about 30 seconds. Longer than ever before. How did that happen?
On to more seated poses, working towards another opportunity for a balance.
Laughable this one. Me, lifting my entire weight from a seated position and balancing. Not going to happen. Never has. But, what the heck……. I’m up! Now, the other side. Again, I’m up! I am up off the ground!
Another lesson. Like I haven’t been presented with this one a few times over.
When I give it up. When I surrender. When it doesn’t matter whether I can…. or cannot, it just comes. Not without work or focus or determination. But it seems like when I’m not searching for or expecting a particular outcome, it just happens.
And not that achieving either of these is a big deal after. Tomorrow they may not happen again. Does it even matter? Only so much that I recognize that it isn’t important to achieve either, but that I’m willing to work and willing to be with whatever happens.
In yoga class. In life.
(and finally, I’m very behind …. in publishing this post)

The bustling hill town of Bandarawela is, like Nuwara Eliya, in the cool Central Highlands, though it is further south and at a lower altitude (1,230 metres) than its more famous cousin. Often considered to be the "forgotten" hill station, it tends to be dry when Nuwara Eliya is wet and vice versa and is known for having the best

------------question-----------------------
What were some of the feelings and reflections of the narrator as they prepared to leave their village after two years in the Peace Corps
------------correct----------------------
e with three 30-ml bottles of cosmetic argan oil and a bar of argan soap. I’m excited about all of them. Honestly…I hope I can somehow continue doing business with them. Perhaps I can start a distribution “center” from the US. Hmm…
- Mohammed, my hanut man. I returned an empty Fanta bottle and, in the process, said goodbye to him. In my two years here, he was always patient with me as I tried to remember the items I wanted to buy as well as the name of the items.
- Dinner with Little Fatima and her family: grandmother Aicha, aunt Amina, aunt Fatima and brother Ahmed. For evening tea, Aunt Fatima surprised me with a chocolate chip cake! There were four lit candles on the cake as she brought the tray of helwa into the room! Too…wonderful. I actually had them restage the candles because I forgot my camera when I first went to their house; consequently, I ran home – lHamdullah it was so close! – fetched my camera, ran back into the house, and asked to get pictures taken with the cake. Super, super thoughtful!
By the time dinner came out, I was still stuffed from all the food (bread) that I ate earlier in the day. Even so, I was a sport and ate my part of dinner. Why? Because this was my last meal in the village!
I know I didn’t say goodbye to everyone here – that would’ve been impossible. Instead, I chose to say goodbye to those who, in one way or another, showed me kindness of an intangible kind. Who knows, maybe these people were so hospitable because they knew/thought I was coming from a more privileged background and would not take advantage of them and their kindness…but I want to believe that was not the case.
The wonderful people of Imi nTlit…you’ve kept my heart warm these past two years. As I told many people today, you have been my family for two years. Thank you.
Funny story of the day: My PCV friend’s friend who is an American non-PCV male tried giving me a hug as he was leaving in my site. His movement made it closer to a hug than the Englishman’s did; even so, I managed to push/gentle nudge his enclosing arms away from me and stand firm about not hugging any males by sticking out my hand for a handshake.
Yesterday, as I sat around waiting for some type of transportation to drive through my village that would take me to Smimou, I thought about a couple questions that I anticipate being asked after I return to the US:
(1) Knowing what you know now, would you do Peace Corps again?
(2) Would you change anything about your Peace Corps service?
To the first question, my answer is: Yes, I would do my service again, my service being the one I am just about to complete. No*, I would not go on a second tour of Peace Corps service. (*at least in the foreseeable future. I mean, never say never, right?) It’s not that I didn’t enjoy it because I did – read my PC blog, createmyworld.wordpress.com – rather, it’s because one of my goals was to join the Peace Corps.
To the second question, my answer is again two-fold. On the one hand, no – my time in Morocco was the way it was because that’s how I chose to shape my service. On the other hand, yes – there’s so much that could still be done. So much that, in hindsight, I see I could have done. Then again, it’s also in hindsight that you see how things could have been different, isn’t it?
Perspective…that’s one of the many things that Peace Corps has taught me to appreciate.
It’s my second-to-last night in site. I gave away my things to a PCV, her friend, and Little Fatima’s family today. Except for the items I plan to pack up, this house that I’ve rented for the past two years is barren of all things mine. Well, except for my two-year calendar. I’ve decided that my PC calendar will be the last thing that I take down. How do I feel about PC at this moment?
If you allow yourself to make it through these two years, through the highest of highs and the lowest of lows and then allow yourself to build yourself up, this time on more secure footing than before, then you will come out of the experience on the other side.
I could go on and on about my experience and all that I’ve learned but, in the interest of keeping this short, I will say two final things:
(1) Peace Corps was/has/is a personal experience – that was my intent and that is what I achieved.
(2) Peace Corps…what an incredible journey

------------question-----------------------
What themes does the movie The Way explore according to the text
------------correct----------------------
n glorified sex outside of marriage. In his latest book, Christopher West explains the Catholic response to this disjoint.
A recently released movie, The Way, by Emilio Estevez and Martin Sheen explore the growth of a man as he struggles with issues in his life and the need for belonging.
Do you live your life or does your life live you? Caught up in a comfortable existence, a doctor becomes estranged from a son he cannot understand. Tragedy forces the doctor to reflect on life. He begins to draw closer to God and slowly reconnects with those around him.
If you are in the mood for some Christian suspense....check out the upcoming April release of DiAnn Mills new book, The Chase......
I'm still interested in comments and suggestions for book club. What interests you? Drop by the forum and share your thoughts.
As always, blessings for the week ahead!

Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner batteries have a bad history, but regulators aren’t sure they are to blame for the latest problems with the airline company’s latest jet.
Japan’s two largest airlines replaced the lithium-ion batteries in their 787s multiple times in the months before two batteries caught fire in flight. One battery was aboard an All Nippon Airways (ANA) jet, while the other was aboard a United Airlines jet.
Reuters reports that both ANA and Japan Airlines released comments that point toward battery reliability issues long before the fires. ANA changed 10 batteries on its Dreamliners last year.
They were not required to inform accident investigators in the US, however, because the incidents didn’t compromise the plane’s safety. JAL spokeswoman Sze Hunn Yap also stated that the company replaced batteries on “a few occasions.”
The news comes as Japanes

it’s going to shows religiously, and meeting people that has allowed us to cultivate our sound.”
Though they’ve aged beyond adolescence, their approach to music is still full of an energy and curiosity you can find in any basement teenage jam session. However, their precision and attitude speaks volumes, pummeling your eardrums. Fitting then, that they’ve released their first full-length album, Sore, on October 9th via Partisan Records. The 11-song powerhouse of gritty punk rock and wall-of-sound rock ‘n’ roll was produced in a frantic, yet fun 11 days. Ball and Monks are joined on the recording by Jimmy Tony (bass) and Benjamin Reinhartz (drums), giving Dilly Dally a full sound fraught with desire and desperation. Sore projects feminist ideals and healthy rage, wrapped in a twisted, black bubblegum package.
“What affects me about the album is all of the work that everyone else did, you know? Writing up the thank-you
“A record at the end of the day, a band at the end of the day is just a huge collaboration with a bunch of people. You need to have friends and you need to have people that believe in you.”
Monks is excited for what’s coming next for the burgeoning project.
“We don’t want to repeat history. What we’re trying to do is carve out our own place for Dilly Dally,” she says, cognizant of the Pixies comparisons.
“We’re big fans of a lot of shit, and there’s nods and references throughout the record but when people hear the it they’ll find references but they’ll also find pieces of who we are and what we want to bring to music.”
Dilly Dally will be playing The Good Will in Winnipeg on October 23 and Broken City in Calgary on October 25.AB, Alberta, Broken City, Dilly Dally, Manitoba, MB, The Good Will

What are the main components involved in estate planning in Keene
------------correct----------------------
"Estate planning" in Keene refers to the decisions a person makes regarding what is to be done with their assets after their death, and the process of implementing those wishes.
You will often need to seek the help of a professional with legal and/or financial expertise when in the process of estate planning. Simple mistakes in an estate plan can cause serious problems, including legal and personal conflicts between your survivors.
Estate planning can have many positive effects on the planner during life, as well. These benefits are normally somewhat intangible, revolving around the peace of mind that comes with knowing that, after your death, you family will be taken care of and that they'll know what your last wishes are. Nonetheless, most people find this very valuable. To that end, you should come up with a power-of-attorney agreement. When you grant someone power of attorney, you have given them the power to make particular decisions on your behalf. You can grant them as much or as little authority as you want. Most people, however, give family members or life partners power of attorney with respect to medical care, so if they become incapacitated, their wishes will still be carried out.
If you want to maximize the odds that your wishes will be followed after your death, you should do everything you can to make them legally binding. While this is not always possible, a Keene attorney will be able to make sure that, where it is possible, it is done.
Common Features of Keene Estates
Will: This is normally a major component in any estate plan. A will is a document in which a person lays out what they want done with their property after their death. These gifts normally have the effect of transferring legal ownership of the property to the named beneficiary.
Living Will: Unlike ordinary wills, a living will contains instructions concerning a person's medical care. Some recent high-profile controversies have illustrated the importance of making a living will, even for yo

------------question-----------------------
What historical crisis does the author reference as a comparison to their current anxiety about a potential debt default
------------correct----------------------
How to Handle a Debt Default. You Know. Just in Case.
On the ninth day of Shutdown I started to freak out.
Should I sell my stocks? What do I buy? I pictured my portfolio trashed, me without a job, my 60-something parents' retirement delayed, the economy in chaos. The misery of 2008 and 2009, only worse.
This wasn't like me. I'm an experienced personal finance reporter in my 30s who has absorbed, and given, many a lecture on staying calm in the face of fear. Now, at least in the investment world, I couldn't seem to find anybody as agitated as I was, and that was agitating me. The stock market sits complacently near an all-time high. Where were my angsters-in-arms? I even got a pitch from a public relations firm letting me know of a financial adviser who could comment on "how to handle a government default."
How to handle a government default?
While my head was filling with apocalyptic visions, Wall Street and Washington seemed to expect a last-minute deal. My worry was that the last minute would be too late, crushing our reputation as a haven, already shaken in 2011's near-default. The U.S. Treasury might be able to avoid default without Congress's approval, but not without sparking a deep recession.
In 2007 and 2008, I interviewed more than a happy few economists and strategists who kept saying it was going to be fine. Just before I took a long and poorly timed vacation in September of 2008, I wrote a blog post quoting three distinguished experts who thought stocks had hit bottom. "When people make predictions about this stock market," I wrote, "I don't know whether to congratulate them for their boldness or question their sanity."
Now I know.
That crisis actually benefited me, in a way. I held on to my job and diligently saved more in my 401(k) plan. Today I feel flush after the S&P 500's 150 percent rise since the market bottom in March 2009.
And that means I have more to lose.
I IM'd my friend Mark, a finance nerd.
Me: Hey curious what you think: are you worried about default?
Me: cause I'm terrified
Mark: I just wish I had more cash on hand to invest in case it does.
This was reassuring, kind of. Maybe there would be an upside to any chaos.
Mark: The U.S. will lose its dominance with or without a default.
Mark: Gold & bitcoins are probably the only other assets to compete [with Treasuries]
Should I have more cash around to take advantage of market panic? Was the financial system so precarious that Bitcoins, the investment du jour of drug smugglers and money launderers, could make a comeback? Should I be building a bunker in my basement and stocking it with the vegetarian equivalent of Spam? Is there a vegetarian equivalent of Spam? Throw in a few gold bars? Actually pay attention to libertarians?
I would call Milo. That's what I would do. I would call Milo.
In previous crises, when I needed a quote from a voice of reason, I often reached out to Milo Benningfield of Benningfield Financial Advisors in San Francisco. Now, on the phone, he sounded relaxed.
He admitted to feeling a bit of gut-tightening after reading the same articles that I had. "It was kind of like watching a trailer for a summer blockbuster," conjuring up economic horrors like worldwide depression in place of exploding cities and Zombie apocalypse, he said. But he wasn’t freaking out. Like most blockbuster movies,

In the present, Robin admits her greatest fear: to be seen as a burden by her crewmates and cast away, because being with her means having the world as their enemy.

"Without these Chinese cars we wouldn't have won this war in Misrata," said Abu Zeid. He caressed the side of the truck.
Once fitted with a weapon, the truck is painted black _ the words "Feb 17 Revolution" spray- painted in white. The tricolor rebel flag emblazons the side of the vehicle.
In another workshop, the wooden butts of AK-47 automatic rifles are repaired and replaced.
Across the workshops, there are mechanics, engineers, and welders who've been tested as they turn their civilian knowledge into weapons and ammunition design and the trajectory of rockets.
Homemade, rust-brown steel rockets lean in a pile against a wall. Near them are rockets captured from Gadhafi troops.
"We had no time to learn, we had to just become creative," said Ali Ibrahim, who used to drive trucks and now builds rockets.
He said that at the beginning, rebels weapons makers were just working from intuition. Now they can copy and take ideas from the old Soviet and former East Bloc weapons taken from Gadhafi soldiers.
But many of the men at this workshop have nothing to do with mechanics or engineering at all.
Before the war started, Mohammed al-Ahmar ran a women's clothing store called 'The Princesses' Palace' off Tripoli Street. Some of the fiercest battles between Libyan rebels and Gadhafi's army rattled along that street for days.
"Gadhafi's troops destroyed my shop and I lost 12 friends in the fighting," he said. "How could I just repair and open my shop again and go back to business?" he asked.
Al-Ahmar, 38, said he wanted to honor the memory of his dead friends. So he showed up one day at the college where he heard mechanics and engineers were maintaining weapons.
Today, wearing a gray mechanic's uniform, he balanced a cigarette between his lips as bored a hole into a slab of metal. It's destined to be part of a machine gun.
"The guys here are easy on me. They know my skills are limited in this kind of work, so they teach me something new everyday. I do small things like weld and cut metal," he said. "I am definitely going back to the clothing business as soon as Gadhafi falls."

"Estate planning" in Keene refers to the decisions a person makes regarding what is to be done with their assets after their death, and the process of implementing those wishes.
You will often need to seek the help of a professional with legal and/or financial expertise when in the process of estate planning. Simple mistakes in an estate plan can cause serious problems, including legal and personal conflicts between your survivors.
Estate planning can have many positive effects on the planner during life, as well. These benefits are normally somewhat intangible, revolving around the peace of mind that comes with knowing that, after your death, you family will be taken care of and that they'll know what your last wishes are. Nonetheless, most people find this very valuable. To that end, you should come up with a power-of-attorney agreement. When you grant someone power of attorney, you have given them the power to make particular decisions on your behalf. You can grant them as much or as little authority as you want.

If you want to maximize the odds that your wishes will be followed after your death, you should do everything you can to make them legally binding. While this is not always possible, a Keene attorney will be able to make sure that, where it is possible, it is done.
Common Features of Keene Estates

What is being announced regarding the proposed new facilities in Bacchus Marsh
------------correct----------------------
. The Moorabool Council and the Bacchus Marsh Community Consortium have consulted with over 6,500 people on the range of proposals.
“The existing outdoor pool is almost 80 years old and only available a few months each year. Today’s announcement will deliver a much needed indoor pool 12 months a year.
“This project is a great example of a community working together. The local council, Rotary Bacchus Marsh, health agencies, police, business people, schools, sporting groups, aged care, and community groups have combined to achieve this great community outcome.”
The funding for the project is from the latest round of the Regional Development Australia Fund and is already included in the budget.
“These projects come on top of the Rudd Labor Government’s record investment in regional Australia, including the National Plan for School Improvement, the National Broadband Network and the Roads to Recovery program – all of which are helping to secure the future of regional communities.” Ms King said.

What are some surprising experiences the author had upon returning to America after serving in Morocco
------------correct----------------------
Reverse-culture shock hasn’t been as jarring as how a few RPCVs made it sound. Then again, I didn’t expect to feel overwhelmed during my first time back in an American supermarket – that’s a common anecdote shared by RPCVs about their initial moments at home.
For me, it’s been the little things that took me by surprise:
- Instant – and hot! – water on demand. During my first night home, I turned on the hot water with the expectation that there’d be a delay in water coming out from there. Nope! Not only did the water fall out of the faucet the moment I turned it on, but it was also HOT! Yes, HOT! I am getting excited about instant hot water. In Imi nTlit, tap water wasn’t always readily available in my house. If I wanted hot water, I had to boil it. Now? I just turn a knob.
- Eating with my left hand is socially acceptable. Before Morocco, I used utensils with my right hand but snacked with my left (e.g., chips and cookies). In Morocco, I got used to only eating with my right hand in public (though, towards the end of my service, I did “rebel” and snack with my left hand – scandalous, I know). Now, I’m sort of back to snacking with my left. The only difference? I feel like people are watching me use my left hand to eat. I know that’s not the case…but I haven’t been able to shake that feeling off.
- Wearing a scarf…feels like a security blanket. In rural Morocco, a females hide the shape of their body. In America, it’s perfectly acceptable to wear fitted clothing. Then again…this last bit could be a weather thing. It could also be a style thing. It could also be me dressing for the occasion and a scarf so happens to work with making an outfit just that more versatile.
Life in America…oh, and did I mention I got a smart phone? Progress, I know.

(translation: Goodbye, Imi nTlit. Small vacation in Essaouira. Later to Rabat and Casablanca. God willing.)
I spent my last day hanging out with my most cherished ladies (and a handful of fellas in the process):
- Lunch #1 with my host family: Fadma, Fatima, Khadija, Mina, Rkiya, Hayat, Hussain, the still untitled older woman who is generally in a sour mood but always sweet with me (and later Aicha at Tamounte). Fadma’s pregnant belly is getting bigger. I surprised them with a photo album filled with pictures I took of/with the family. In return, the girls gifted me a bottle of amlou.
- Lunch #2 with Fabulous Fatima and her daughter. I learned from Fatima that she and Aicha Hussain (my host grandmother) are no longer on speaking terms. (Whaa?? They were such good friends when I was living with the host family!) Besides that piece of news, I learned more about Fatima’s family.
- Tea with Spicy Aicha. I haven’t seen her in such a long time! I know, it’s largely my fault. I’m so happy I saw her today. I had just left Fabulous Fatima’s and was heading to my house when, having walked past the path up to her house, I turned around and made myself go to her house. Honestly, I am SO happy I did! I would’ve been really bummed if I hadn’t. I learned that her husband passed away about a month and a half ago. Her youngest granddaughter is so big now. Spicy Aicha…you have such a spirit about you. Aicha was dressed in white colors, indicative of a wife in mourning. Her husband had been ill for a long time. Since Aicha was still in the 4-month mourning period, I wasn’t able to get a picture with her. Instead, I took pictures with her granddaughters.
- The women of Tamounte Cooperative – all the ladies (there are too many to list, so many that I don’t even know their names by heart!), girls (i.e., Latifa and Khadija), and, of course, Taarabt and Rachida. I spent some time chatting with Aicha, my host grandmother, helping the women sort argan, and a bit more time chatting with the girls, Taarabt and Rachida. I learned that there are new products – soap made with local herbs and natural scents! I also learned that the cooperative has a website up – that I want to check out!

What are the potential consequences of Circle taking over Hinchingbrooke Hospital, according to the health union Unison
------------correct----------------------
The chief executive of the first private company to take charge of an NHS district general hospital, in Cambridgeshire, has said he would like to see the model extended across the health service in England.
Six months after Circle took over the struggling Hinchingbrooke Hospital Trust in Huntingdon, it has become "one of the best in the country" for quality and is on course to balance its books financially next year, said Ali Parsa. But health union Unison warned that the company's arrival has led to a cut in cleaning and increased job insecurity for staff, which could be detrimental to patient care.
Circle needs a surplus of £70 million over the next 10 years to make a profit at Hinchingbrooke, but Mr Parsa said this would only happen after the hospital's projected losses of £230 million are eliminated.
The Circle model, under which the company is "co-owned" by its workers and clinicians are given decision-making powers within the hospital, should "absolutely" be extended more widely across the NHS, he said. Asked if Circle would like to run more NHS hospitals, he replied: "We would love it."
Mr Parsa told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "We believe our partners - doctors, nurses, healthcare professionals - should run their own hospitals. Look at Germany, where private companies run more hospitals than government does and satis

The Rudd Labor Government today announced $7 million towards the Bacchus Marsh Indoor Aquatic Centre, building on its record of support for strong, prosperous regional and local communities.
The Minister for Regional Australia and Member for Ballarat, Catherine King, said this project would deliver great benefits to the community, and help build a stronger future.
“Federal Labor is serious about investing in regional and local communities and helping them to meet future challenges and opportunities,” Ms King said.
Ms King said funding for the Bacchus Marsh Indoor Aquatic Centre is a well-deserved win for the community and will provide for a new 25 metre 8 lane pool, a learn-to-swim pool, entry and kiosk, administration facilities and change rooms.
“Families across Bacchus Marsh will benefit enormously from this new indoor pool, particularly through expanded recreational options which will deliver improved health and lifestyle outcomes for all in the community.

regions. If time variability is assumed I found that, due to clumpiness, it is not possible to change the spectrum of AGN galaxy from absorbed to unabsorbed, but clumps could be responsible for more mild variations in the spectra. If the X-ray and optical spectra are not simultaneously observed there exists some level of disagreement on the degree of obscuration. iii

------------question-----------------------
What consequence does an arms ban have in understanding the political problems of the Middle East, according to The Times
------------correct----------------------
only when arms ceased to pour into the region “will the dust begin to clear away and the real human and political problems be seen in a clearer light.” The Times noted that an arms ban need not involve any Middle Eastern country in negotiations, yet would provide a “sharp test of Soviet sincerity.”
Asserting that “patience and goodwill” will not solve the problems of the region, the Times said that “Israel cannot be wished away by the Arabs or by anyone else.” It suggested that even if the Arab-Israel conflict were ended all insecurity and instability in the Middle East would not be ended

------------question-----------------------
What mindset does the author adopt towards their yoga practice during the class on Saturday
------------correct----------------------
I’m behind, missing Day 32. In writing, not the yoga. Well, let me change that. I missed Day 31 of yoga, so I am more behind than I thought. And let me say that skipping one day of yoga practice, now feels like a very long time!
But as the story goes….. an interesting thing happened along the way.
No yoga on Thursday. Friday, done!
Saturday…. and class wasn’t until 9:30am so I had a long time to think about the practice ahead. A long time to build some expectations – or not.
My yoga practice goes up and down, forward and backward with regards to how I feel about it, progress, what I expect to get out of it. Saturday I was at a point of surrender. You know, feeling like it doesn’t matter what the heck I do or what progress I make, all I really want is to get on my mat and move a little.
Why is it we think we have to get somewhere? Make progress? Go a little further? Do a little more? It isn’t what yoga is supposed to be about. For me, it is supposed to be doing something I love. Keeping my body moving and healthy. Building awareness and focus. Learning to be calm, still and peaceful. That is my yoga. So why the continual need in the back of my mind that it has to improve?
I went to class ready to accept it, wherever it was today. I discussed my somewhat problematic SI joint with the teacher and said I was going to take it easy, try to bring some awareness into what might be causing me the joint problem. If I stopped doing a pose, or opted out, she would know why.
I love this teacher’s classes. Always new and fresh and well paced. We begin. A vinyasa class, building heat

What motivated Mohammed al-Ahmar to change his profession from running a women's clothing store to working in a weapons workshop
------------correct----------------------
r Toyota 4-wheel drive called the Chao Yung Highlander.
"Without these Chinese cars we wouldn't have won this war in Misrata," said Abu Zeid. He caressed the side of the truck.
Once fitted with a weapon, the truck is painted black _ the words "Feb 17 Revolution" spray- painted in white. The tricolor rebel flag emblazons the side of the vehicle.
In another workshop, the wooden butts of AK-47 automatic rifles are repaired and replaced.
Across the workshops, there are mechanics, engineers, and welders who've been tested as they turn their civilian knowledge into weapons and ammunition design and the trajectory of rockets.
Homemade, rust-brown steel rockets lean in a pile against a wall. Near them are rockets captured from Gadhafi troops.
"We had no time to learn, we had to just become creative," said Ali Ibrahim, who used to drive trucks and now builds rockets.
He said that at the beginning, rebels weapons makers were just working from intuition. Now they can copy and take ideas from the old Soviet and former East Bloc weapons taken from Gadhafi soldiers.
But many of the men at this workshop have nothing to do with mechanics or engineering at all.
Before the war started, Mohammed al-Ahmar ran a women's clothing store called 'The Princesses' Palace' off Tripoli Street. Some of the fiercest battles between Libyan rebels and Gadhafi's army rattled along that street for days.
"Gadhafi's troops destroyed my shop and I lost 12 friends in the fighting," he said. "How could I just repair and open my shop again and go back to business?" he asked.
Al-Ahmar, 38, said he wanted to honor the memory of his dead friends. So he showed up one day at the college where he heard mechanics and engineers were maintaining weapons.
Today, wearing a gray mechanic's uniform, he balanced a cigarette between his lips as bored a hole into a slab of metal. It's destined to be part of a machine gun.
"The guys here are easy on me. They know my skills are limited in this kind of work, so they teach me something new everyday. I do small things like weld and cut metal," he said. "I am definitely going back to the clothing business as soon as Gadhafi falls."

"Without these Chinese cars we wouldn't have won this war in Misrata," said Abu Zeid. He caressed the side of the truck.
Once fitted with a weapon, the truck is painted black _ the words "Feb 17 Revolution" spray- painted in white. The tricolor rebel flag emblazons the side of the vehicle.
In another workshop, the wooden butts of AK-47 automatic rifles are repaired and replaced.
Across the workshops, there are mechanics, engineers, and welders who've been tested as they turn their civilian knowledge into weapons and ammunition design and the trajectory of rockets.
Homemade, rust-brown steel rockets lean in a pile against a wall. Near them are rockets captured from Gadhafi troops.
"We had no time to learn, we had to just become creative," said Ali Ibrahim, who used to drive trucks and now builds rockets.

It has been observed that approximately 10% to 30% of AGNs show no X-ray absorption, whereas the optical spectrum suggests signi cant obscuration. One possible explanation is that the obscuring medium consists of dense clumps. In the model, using Monte Carlo simulations, I conduct a study to check whether the clumpiness of the torus is a possible reason for the mismatch in optical and X-ray spectrums. For a variety of torus con gurations I have found that there is no mismatch in the number of the clumps intersected between the lines of sight originating in the X-ray and optical

My memory is sketchy about this but I'll tell you what I remember. Craig and I were friends at SHS and talked about our aspirations for careers in military aviation. Craig went to the Naval Academy out of high school and we did our best to stay in touch. I saw him twice during our post-SHS years. The first time was when we met under the north goalpost at Soldier Field in Chicago after the AF-Navy game in 1968 and we had a brief opportunity to catch up with each other. In 1970, I was a guest of Craig's at the USNA for a weekend, attended a formal ball with him that Saturday night and had the opportunity to meet his future bride-to-be. In '73 or '74 I was in Germany in the armed forces and was told that I had a message in the base communications center. I don't know how she tracked me down, but Craig's wife had sent me a communication through military channels informing me of Craig's unfortunate death. He died in an aircraft accident, a night instrument flight out of Lemoore Naval Air Station, CA, flying the A-4 Skyhawk. I know no other details and there was no contact information for his widow. Craig was a patriot, a fine person, and a good friend. I will always remember him fondly as I do other fallen warriors who have tragically lost their lives in defense of this great nation of ours.

The University of Wisconsin-Green Bay will host a presentation by a well-known local chef and anti-hunger activist to cap its observance of National Food Day on Thursday, Oct. 24.
Chef J.R. Schoenfeld, creator and owner of Chives restaurant in Suamico and founder of the Seven Loaves Project to feed the hungry, will deliver a keynote address and a cooking demonstration at 6 p.m. in the Phoenix Room of the University Union on the campus at 2420 Nicolet Drive, Green Bay.
Schoenfeld began the Seven Loaves Project as a way to promote food security for communities that have struggled to feed themselves. This is done by providing training, essential tools, and basic materials for building and operating bakery schools. Schoenfeld had traveled to Rwanda in December 2009 — 15 years after the central African nation had been decimated by genocide — to help a humanitarian group feed thousands of starving villagers. Working with Father Leszek Czelusniak, a missionary in Rwanda, he decided to pursue an ongoing solution. The Seven Loaves Project’s mission is embodied in a familiar-sounding proverb, “Give a man a loaf of bread and he eats for a day. Teach a man to bake and his village eats for a lifetime.”
Schoenfeld’s talk is part of the larger UW-Green Bay celebration of National Food Day, a movement for healthy, affordable and sustainable food. Events begin first thing in the morning with breakfast at the Richard Mauthe Center on campus. The remainder of the events take place between 4:30 and 9 p.m. in the

What conclusions did investigators reach regarding the melted ANA Dreamliner battery
------------correct----------------------
e officials investigating the melted ANA Dreamliner battery have concluded that there were no problems inside the battery due to its manufacturing.
Al Jazeera notes that Shigeru Takano, director of the Civil Aviation Bureau’s air transport safety unit, stated:
“There were several reports on quality control issues, but there was nothing that would have caused an immediate problem inside the battery.”
US aviation safety regulators also stated on Sunday that their initial investigation uncovered “no obvious anomalies” in the battery from the United fire.
The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is the first aircraft to use the lithium-ion battery for back-up and auxiliary power. Airbus, who previously warned against using the type of battery, plans to use it in its upcoming A350 jet.
The Dreamliner’s battery problem has kept Boeing’s newest aircraft grounded around the world

I really do love the industry I work in. I get to feed my need for all things creative and I get to work with some of the most talented, creative people out there. Not only do I get to learn from these amazing individuals, I get to enjoy their visual creations.
Let me introduce you to my friend Jove. He is the owner and creative director of Jove Meyer Events. He will plan and design your event from start to finish. Jove is creative, friendly and really pays attention to every little detail. His designs are whimsical, thoughtful and fun. I know a lot of planners/designers in this industry so I wanted to know what makes him different from all of the rest…
1. What is your approach to planning an event? My first step is to get to know the client as intimately as possible, ideally over a glass of wine or a cup of coffee. I want to know their intent, their vision and goals for the event. I strive to create authentic experiences by incorporating as much of the clients personal favorites as possible with a touch of my own flair. I approach the planning of an event by making sure I plan details for all five senses (touch, taste, smell, sight and sound) of the event. By touching all five senses the event becomes an experience not to be forgotten!
2. What is your favorite part of the planning process? I love the design aspect of planning an event. Taking in all of the elements and creating a look and feel for the space, transforming things to create memorable

In the early 1700s, people travelling along the Arkansas River discovered a rock formation on the southern bank of the river. Jean Baptiste Benard de la Harpe, a French explorer was the person to give this nickname and it stuck.

faction with their health service is significantly higher than here.
Defending the introduction of private sector practices into the public health service, Mr Parsa said: "The British economy is losing £170 billion a year. If a company came in and said, 'I can save all that money for the British taxpayer and in return I want 10%', I would do that deal as a taxpayer, any day. That's the deal we did with the NHS."
– Ali Parsa, Chief executive of Circle
"I think we need to take private/public, the ideology, out of the health service and let the NHS provide free at the point of delivery care."
Karen Jennings, assistant general secretary of Unison, told Today: "Unison challenged the notion that Circle should take over Hinchingbrooke, but they are now managing it and we are working with them.
"I think it's right that Hinchingbrooke celebrates these very, very early successes, but I do need to point out that one of the ways that they started to save money - and this was one of our fears - was that through newly negotiated contracts with outsourced cleaning services, they have made cuts.
"That means that there's going to be cuts in cleaning staff, a vital and critical group of staff to ensure that there's no cross-infection at the hospital. These are very, very early signs of concerns we had about a private management firm taking over.

. The Moorabool Council and the Bacchus Marsh Community Consortium have consulted with over 6,500 people on the range of proposals.
“The existing outdoor pool is almost 80 years old and only available a few months each year. Today’s announcement will deliver a much needed indoor pool 12 months a year.
“This project is a great example of a community working together. The local council, Rotary Bacchus Marsh, health agencies, police, business people, schools, sporting groups, aged care, and community groups have combined to achieve this great community outcome.”
The funding for the project is from the latest round of the Regional Development Australia Fund and is already included in the budget.
“These projects come on top of the Rudd Labor Government’s record investment in regional Australia, including the National Plan for School Improvement, the National Broadband Network and the Roads to Recovery program – all of which are helping to secure the future of regional communities.” Ms King said.
Further information on the Regional Development Australia Fund is available at: www.regional.gov.au

e with three 30-ml bottles of cosmetic argan oil and a bar of argan soap. I’m excited about all of them. Honestly…I hope I can somehow continue doing business with them. Perhaps I can start a distribution “center” from the US. Hmm…
- Mohammed, my hanut man. I returned an empty Fanta bottle and, in the process, said goodbye to him. In my two years here, he was always patient with me as I tried to remember the items I wanted to buy as well as the name of the items.
- Dinner with Little Fatima and her family: grandmother Aicha, aunt Amina, aunt Fatima and brother Ahmed. For evening tea, Aunt Fatima surprised me with a chocolate chip cake! There were four lit candles on the cake as she brought the tray of helwa into the room! Too…wonderful. I actually had them restage the candles because I forgot my camera when I first went to their house; consequently, I ran home – lHamdullah it was so close! – fetched my camera, ran back into the house, and asked to get pictures taken with the cake. Super, super thoughtful!
By the time dinner came out, I was still stuffed from all the food (bread) that I ate earlier in the day. Even so, I was a sport and ate my part of dinner. Why? Because this was my last meal in the village!
I know I didn’t say goodbye to everyone here – that would’ve been impossible. Instead, I chose to say goodbye to those who, in one way or another, showed me kindness of an intangible kind. Who knows, maybe these people were so hospitable because they knew/thought I was coming from a more privileged background and would not take advantage of them and their kindness…but I want to believe that was not the case.
The wonderful people of Imi nTlit…you’ve kept my heart warm these past two years. As I told many people today, you have been my family for two years. Thank you.
Funny story of the day: My PCV friend’s friend who is an American non-PCV male tried giving me a hug as he was leaving in my site. His movement made it closer to a hug than the Englishman’s did; even so, I managed to push/gentle nudge his enclosing arms away from me and stand firm about not hugging any males by sticking out my hand for a handshake.
Yesterday, as I sat around waiting for some type of transportation to drive through my village that would take me to Smimou, I thought about a couple questions that I anticipate being asked after I return to the US:
(1) Knowing what you know now, would you do Peace Corps again?
(2) Would you change anything about your Peace Corps service?
To the first question, my answer is: Yes, I would do my service again, my service being the one I am just about to complete. No*, I would not go on a second tour of Peace Corps service. (*at least in the foreseeable future. I mean, never say never, right?) It’s not that I didn’t enjoy it because I did – read my PC blog, createmyworld.wordpress.com – rather, it’s because one of my goals was to join the Peace Corps.
To the second question, my answer is again two-fold. On the one hand, no – my time in Morocco was the way it was because that’s how I chose to shape my service. On the other hand, yes – there’s so much that could still be done. So much that, in hindsight, I see I could have done. Then again, it’s also in hindsight that you see how things could have been different, isn’t it?
Perspective…that’s one of the many things that Peace Corps has taught me to appreciate.
It’s my second-to-last night in site. I gave away my things to a PCV, her friend, and Little Fatima’s family today. Except for the items I plan to pack up, this house that I’ve rented for the past two years is barren of all things mine. Well, except for my two-year calendar. I’ve decided that my PC calendar will be the last thing that I take down. How do I feel about PC at this moment?
If you allow yourself to make it through these two years, through the highest of highs and the lowest of lows and then allow yourself to build yourself up, this time on more secure footing than before, then you will come out of the experience on the other side.
I could go on and on about my experience and all that I’ve learned but, in the interest of keeping this short, I will say two final things:
(1) Peace Corps was/has/is a personal experience – that was my intent and that is what I achieved.
(2) Peace Corps…what an incredible journey

What I particularly like is how the abstract lyrics work very well for the theme of the record, the seasonal changes. This also helps in bringing folk music closer to the roots, since most of these old songs would have been highly ritualistic and bound up with traditions.

Chef J.R. Schoenfeld, creator and owner of Chives restaurant in Suamico and founder of the Seven Loaves Project to feed the hungry, will deliver a keynote address and a cooking demonstration at 6 p.m. in the Phoenix Room of the University Union on the campus at 2420 Nicolet Drive, Green Bay.
Schoenfeld began the Seven Loaves Project as a way to promote food security for communities that have struggled to feed themselves. This is done by providing training, essential tools, and basic materials for building and operating bakery schools. Schoenfeld had traveled to Rwanda in December 2009 — 15 years after the central African nation had been decimated by genocide — to help a humanitarian group feed thousands of starving villagers. Working with Father Leszek Czelusniak, a missionary in Rwanda, he decided to pursue an ongoing solution. The Seven Loaves Project’s mission is embodied in a familiar-sounding proverb, “Give a man a loaf of bread and he eats for a day. Teach a man to bake and his village eats for a lifetime.”
Schoenfeld’s talk is part of the larger UW-Green Bay celebration of National Food Day, a movement for healthy, affordable and sustainable food. Events begin first thing in the morning with breakfast at the Richard Mauthe Center on campus. The remainder of the events take place between 4:30 and 9 p.m. in the

How did Aref Abu Zeid's background influence his involvement in the war efforts against Moammar Gadhafi
------------correct----------------------
Aref Abu Zeid used to be a heavy equipment engineer at the Libya Steel Company. Now he runs an 80-man team working 12 hours a day turning out rockets and weapons to fight Moammar Gadhafi's forces.
In this rebel stronghold in western Libya, civilian engineers, mechanics and tradesmen are pumping out materiel to arm the uprising against Gadhafi's rule that has become a civil war.
"None of us here have anything to do with the military," said Abu Zeid, 50, a short man with a thick salt and pepper beard and an easy smile. "Our need to protect our homes, our lives and our city forced us into this war work."
Misrata, the country's third-largest city located 125 miles (200 kilometers) southeast of the capital, is home to the largest steel company in the country and metal is always available here.
"Owners of carpentry and mechanical supply warehouses would just open their doors," Abu Zeid said. "They told us 'Take what you want.' Others bring us piles of money to buy what we need."
At the beginning of the war in Misrata, mechanics were repairing arms in their homes and garages. But as it raged on, the engineers realized they needed bigger operations and a more organized force.
That's when about eight schools across the city turned into weapons' workshops. Volunteers flooded in to help.
Abu Zeid's operation _ the Complete Industrial Skills College _ is a sprawling campus with shops fitted with welding gear and machinery where youngsters formerly learned engineering and machine making.
Now the weapons-making crews receive request forms from the front lines that ask for specific machinery and weapons.
Clanging metal and sparking welders fill the main workshop. The floor is strewn with electrical wiring and scrap metal. Old instructional and safety posters still hang on the walls, a reminder that this was once a school.
Two men worked on installing Grad rockets onto the back of a pickup truck. Scavenged car parts, scrap metal and captured rocket launchers made up the rest of the project.
The truck itself was one of hundreds the rebels found stored in Gadhafi's government and military buildings. They are Chinese knockoffs of a popula

ident or charges when Lincoln Adim was cast, and he himself denied ever having engaged in or having been charged with any sexual misconduct. We employ a well-respected and highly experienced third party who has done thousands of background checks consistent with industry standards to do a nationwide background check in this case. The report we received did not reference any incident or charge relating to the recent conviction – or any other charges relating to sexual misconduct. We are currently investigating why the report did not contain this information, which we will share when we have it.”
While we wait for more details on the situation, which is admittedly highly suspect and not the only disgusting action he’s been accused of, one thing is for sure: Becca certainly deserves better dudes that this.

CALGARY — Bands are often painted with the same brush as those used for their influences. This brush can colour interpretations before a group steps on a stage or records a song.
