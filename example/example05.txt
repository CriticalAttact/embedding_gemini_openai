------------question-----------------------
What are the potential impacts of the proposed law on motorcycle manufacturers and the concerns voiced by the motorcycle community
------------correct----------------------
torcycle manufacturers, the fear has been that requiring anti-lock brakes and on board diagnostic equipment would drive up their costs, making the bikes more difficult to sell, especially during such periods of economic woes in Europe. Some current models intended for value may go extinct altogether.
Are all these fears warranted?
“The proposal for a new law still requires some improvements,” says Aline Delhaye, General Secretary of the Federation of European Motorcyclists’ Associations (FEMA).
“We consider the new delay of the voting on the draft as positive since it shows that MEPs are willing to listen once again to the compromises proposed by FEMA and by the motorcycle industry.”
IMCO members continue to cycle revisions to the law. No one can tell for sure what the final law will resemble, but Reynolds says motorcyclists shouldn’t have too much to fret over.
“It looks like the majority (of the IMCO) is in favor of deleting the bulk of the anti-tampering provisions. There will be a couple of points that will remain about defining powertrain, but basically, our point is that anti-tampering doesn’t really have a place in this draft law,” Reynolds says. “It’s more of a member state issue.”
That would certainly please the motorcycle community and groups working to lobby parliament against the law, or certain provisions within it. It has also been signaled that the provision requiring manufacturers to install costly on board diagnostic equipment would likely be scrapped as well.
As far as requiring headlights to remain on at all times, Malcom Harbour had previously indicated that the committee would be unlikely to budge. The issue of ABS may still be a cause of concern to motorcyclists. According to Reynolds, the committee remains in favor of requiring ABS for all full-sized motorcycles. The debate on the issue is centered on whether or not the law should also require scooters to come with ABS as a required feature.
“The consumer organizations and their associates want ABS on scooters because they are convinced it will bring them safety benefits, but it looks like that plays into the hands of Bosch,” Reynolds says. “In our view, the real safety benefit for scooters is combined braking system. Bosch disagrees.”
FEMA has revealed its willingness to compromise on certain issues. The group even supports some provisions of the law, such as the introduction of stricter emissions limits.
“We are aware that we will also lose some of our positions, especially our opposition to mandatory ABS,” Delhaye says. “But that does not mean that FEMA objects to the proposed new type approval regulation as a whole.”
On the other hand, some bikers and their supporters like Marta Andreasen see no room for compromise.
“I don’t believe the law will be watered down to the level that the lobbyists will still be happy,” she says. But regardless, her position is firm: “My position is to reject this law completely –There shouldn’t be any legislation.

Hair Loss, Even Celebrities Have Addressed This Topic, Yet There Are Not Many Blogs About It
Did you know that as women get older, they will experience hair loss? A lot of Hollywood celebrities have spoken up about hair loss in women. And that has raised awareness because before, women just used to suffer in silence. Speaking to Wall Street Journal, former supermodel, talk show host, and former America’s Next Super Model host Tyra Banks, she narrated how she got alopecia as a result of stress due to pressure of working on her Model land novel.
She fought tears as she spoke about how stressed she got to a point where she could not even appreciate the beauty of the view of the ocean.

Men Wellness Is Another Low Competition Niche

In this blog niche, you can promote all kinds of guy related products, including gadgets, sports equipment, men fashion, men jewelry, you will have lots of products and even books, and there is lots of room to expand and grow your website.

Then you can grow your blog and expand gradually. Anyway, I hope you have found my list helpful, and I also hope that you will find a topic that you can build your blog around.

What award was Rev. Clarence Williams honored with at the National Pastoral Life Center gala
------------correct----------------------
March 27, 2009
Catholic Charities USA's Rev. Clarence Williams Honored by National
Pastoral Life Center
New York, NY-At a gala in New York City last night to celebrate its 25th
Anniversary, the National Pastoral Life Center honored Catholic
Charities USA's Rev. Clarence Williams, CPPS, PhD, with its Monsignor
Philip J. Murnion Faith in Culture Award for his outstanding
contribution to the Catholic Church.
"I am delighted that Father Clarence Williams is receiving the Msgr.
Philip Murnion Faith in Culture Award," said Rev. John E. Hurley, CSP,
executive director of National Pastoral Life Center. "When one thinks of
celebrating the richness of ethnic diversity, Father Clarence comes to
my mind immediately. He enables those willing to open their eyes to see
the diverse blessings that come from one other. He reminds us that no
culture is better than another and each has its history, its anguish,
shortcomings, and blessings. His voice is a blessing in our church and
At Catholic Charities USA (CCUSA), Father Williams develops and conducts
comprehensive diversity and racial equality training for local agencies,
recommends CCUSA positions on diversity that best serve CCUSA and its
member agencies, and shares his Racial Sobriety approach for race
relations within the Catholic Charities network.
Most recently, Father Williams was instrumental in helping CCUSA develop
its paper, Poverty and Racism: Overlapping Threats to the Common Good
and launch a new Web page, E Pluribus Unum-Latin for "out of many, one."
This page promotes and facilitates conversation on poverty and racism.
"Msgr. Philip Murnion's passion for the inclusion of those on the
margins of parish communities was a light to - and a fire for - my
pastoral ministry over a 20-year period," Father Williams said. "I find
myself overwhelmed with the idea of receiving an award in his honor.
Receiving the award is a challenge to hold up the torch of his vision
which invites all people to take their place at the table of the Lord."
Father Williams joins four other Catholic professionals who were honored
for their outstanding contributions to the fields of media, culture, and
parish life, including Washington Post syndicated columnist, E.J.
Dionne, Jr.; actress, Agnes Nixon; executive director of the Hispanic
Catholic Center, Rudy Vargas, IV; and writer and advocate, Monsignor

WorldStage Newsonline-- The U-20 Women National Team, known as Falconets, departed for Korea Republic on Wednesday for a two-week final training camp ahead of this year’s FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup finals.
A delegation including 25 players flew out of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja in the morning to catch an Emirates Ariline flight to Dubai from Lagos in the afternoon, from where the contingent will proceed to Seoul on Thursday morning.
Head Coach Edwin Okon, whose girls swept past Zimbabwe and Democratic Republic of Congo in the African qualifiers without conceding a goal, said his mission is to get the reigning vice champions of the world in super competition-mood before the end of the two-week camping period.
“We have conquered Africa and now, it is time to prepare for the world. We have a massive task on our hands because the 2010 Class got to the final of the World Cup. We just have to prepare ourselves adequately to be able to go one better,” said Okon.
The Nigeria Football Federation has perfected all arrangements for the team’s two-week stay at the Namhe Sports Park,

What was the outcome of the vote regarding the construction of the solar farm in Woodland
------------correct----------------------
ple go the solar park could absorb all the energy from the sun.
My house is surrounded by solar gardens which have reduced the value of my property.
Funny since the city is surrounded by forests and farmland.
The interest in building the solar farm in Woodland comes from its proximity to an electrical substation. Representatives of the company that wants to develop the solar farm, Strata Solar Company, have tried every means to convince the neighbors that the project will not cause cancer or absorb all of the sunlight. But eventually democracy prevailed and with 1 vote for and 3 against, the construction was rejected.

------------question-----------------------
What experiences does the author mention that reflect the beauty and unpredictability of sailing
------------correct----------------------
in high winds and have the boat on it’s side, forming a 60 degree angle with the water, and knowing that you leaning all the way off is the only thing keeping you from flipping over.
It’s also a lot of fun to plot out your course from point A to point B if the wind is blowing directly from B towards A. You can’t just sail directly up wind, so (via tacking) you figure out the most efficient way to zigzag over.
One aspect of sailing I didn’t observe until I was becalmed for several hours is that you don’t have control over everything. Part of what makes it beautiful is that for your voyage, you submit to the natural tendencies to the world. If it’s windy, you go fast, if it’s not, you don’t.
I also totally resonate with the idea that people have been sailing for ages. Leif Erikson, too, was in a sailboat 1000 years ago. And he sailed across the entire Atlantic Ocean.
I’d understand if all the talk about calculation didn’t make sailing seem alluring. But if feeling like Leif Erikson doesn’t get you excited, I’m not sure what will

te the above 6,531-word dissertation, one of my finest pieces. They also gave me the opportunity to create an entire new environmental movement. So thanks, global warming crowd.
I couldn't have done it without you.

The gravity problem was solved decades ago - just spin the ship.
This Mars trip seems a bit half baked. The GDP per capita sign up fee is supposed to be high enough to make people think about it. US citizens have to pay... $38!!! Even in these depressed economic times, that fee wouldn't require much though and for some, they might figure it a small price for an exciting way to end it all.
The cost for sending the first crew is $6B! I guess they're hoping that the people who are signing up are very unpopular and that a lot of people are anxious to see them go - and never come back.
The payload for each launch is 5000 lbs. That seems pretty light considering that that would have to include the means to produce their own food. They will have to be vegetarians (this is one part that actually makes sense - lefty vegans would probably have the required intelligence to sign up for this), but how much does the equipment and supplies for large scale hydroponic farming weigh? My guess is that some of that 5000 lbs is going to be water and some way to convert waste to plant food at least - but that won't last forever. How long can you reuse that?
I think I'll sit this one out. If I can't have a cheeseburger, I'm not going!
"I think I'll sit this one out. If I can't have a cheeseburger, I'm not going!"
You and I are thinking along the exact same lines. I just skimmed the article and missed that payload number. That seems absurd, and for all the reasons you mentioned and then some.
And then there's this:
"The astronauts will undergo a required eight-year training in a secluded location."
"So, Mr. Jennings, how did your eight-year training session go?"
"Just fine, sonny! Hold on a sec while I go fetch my walker."
And then we have:
"Astronauts will filter Martian water from the Martian soil."
Hum. As far as I know, they don't even know for sure that there IS any water on Mars. There's supposed to be some kind of 'dry ice' in the polar regions, but in the soil anywhere else?
"Well, Mr. Jennings, there's good news and bad news. The good news is that they found water in the polar regions."
"Great! What's the bad news?"
"It's minus 230 degrees there."
Say, I hear Jupiter's nice this time of year.
Well, now, I do admit I used the 'sepia tone' filter to give the picture more of a rustic, authentic feeling, but I'm not sure if that actually fits the heading of 'glamorized'.
And, to be truthful, that's not the hat he usually wears around the farm. It's more of a wide-brimmed straw thing. He's wearing that hat in the pic because I told to dress up so he'd look his best.
The digital guitar tuner would be really neat if it could accommodate pre-sets for all a'them alt-tunings too, but damn, $299.00 is a bit rich. Especially when God gave us ears.
"Especially when God gave us ears."
And tuning forks and Korg electronic tuners. I keep a tuning fork stuck behind the strings above the nut in case I want to tune it on the road, but otherwise use my faithful Korg.
But that's an interesting thought about the alternate pre-set tunings. One for standard tuning, another for open-string, another with the high strings tuned a few cents up to give it that sharp, edgy 'rock' feel, another with a few strings tuned a few cents down to give it that country feel? Given that we're just talking about a PC chip, it shouldn't be that difficult to implement.
When you get the capital together and are ready to fire up our new company, let me know. :)
Here you are Doc. If you haven't read this one it's really good. When Hubble needed some more help in 2009.
Looks great (and long). I'll read it later when I have time. As far as the Hubble needing repair back in '06, I wrote a scathing report on it here. I say, can the whole thing and start over.

find. I bet their creators never imagined that these pieces would be turned into clothing or used as textile art.
|Crochet trim, Button, Beads|
It's all about the history of these items and how slowly they have moved through time to become something completely different then initially intended. Not only time but places. I have some Laura Ashley fabric from the early 80s that was purchased for me by someone who was traveling through England and knew I would love this fabric. I still haven't cut it. When I see and touch that fabric I think about the person who bought it for me. How can I cut something like that? Perhaps I'll make a quilt with this fabric so that I can see it and touch it to evoke the memories of another time. If I make that quilt, or if I leave that fabric untouched as that fabric passes through time no one will ever know the emotional value of that piece of fabric.
|Barkcloth and Button|
However, as time marches on all of these materials wind their way to other places and time to become creations made by new hands. They are sometimes used alone or combined with other "finds." So the coming together of all of these pieces is definitely "slow creating."

Grimm will graduate from his Gloucester, Virginia, high school this spring. But he said: "This fight is bigger than me."

Trying out vegan dark chocolate. Liked it, but I prefer the individually packaged ones.

There is something strange about this product. It does not taste bad, but it is not pleasant either. It seems like it was sweetened with a bad stevia extract, but they supposedly use sugar. I get a strange aftertaste, not bitter, just unpleasant.

Following the notice, he said Gap took no action. The termination letter was sent to the company on Thursday.
Gravante told CNBC that Gap’s noncompliance with the agreement has cost him money and that “Ye will now promptly move forward to make up for lost time by opening Yeezy retail stores.”
In June 2020, the two brands announced a 10-year partnership, which many believed was a breath of fresh air for the struggling retailer.
Their first collaboration was a $200 blue-round coat, which ended up being an instant hit.
The “DONDA” rapper’s most recent line was a collaboration with Balenciaga that he sold through Gap.
KTLA has reached out to Gap for a comment, but have yet to hear back

in high winds and have the boat on it’s side, forming a 60 degree angle with the water, and knowing that you leaning all the way off is the only thing keeping you from flipping over.
It’s also a lot of fun to plot out your course from point A to point B if the wind is blowing directly from B towards A. You can’t just sail directly up wind, so (via tacking) you figure out the most efficient way to zigzag over.
One aspect of sailing I didn’t observe until I was becalmed for several hours is that you don’t have control over everything. Part of what makes it beautiful is that for your voyage, you submit to the natural tendencies to the world. If it’s windy, you go fast, if it’s not, you don’t.
I also totally resonate with the idea that people have been sailing for ages. Leif Erikson, too, was in a sailboat 1000 years ago. And he sailed across the entire Atlantic Ocean.
I’d understand if all the talk about calculation didn’t make sailing seem alluring. But if feeling like Leif Erikson doesn’t get you excited, I’m not sure what will

And then when they actually have to fight they get the **** kicked out of them. Yes, that happens a lot. It's kindof sad. Well part of that is the way CMA was traditionally taught, taking years sometimes to get to fighting. Plus, the guys that do wushu now want to get paid for teaching forms so they breed a lot of nonsense. Not all CMA guys don't fight. There's plenty of sanshou, sanda and kuoshu tournaments. Just find a teacher that does fighting.

In the last video it ppers he is telling them not to
push the bag away, but, to pull back at contact.
This could be his version of bag control, or just some
sh*tty advice. . .who knows.

O.G.P.U. blundered most was in its ignorance of foreign countries. It did
not foresee the first result of the trial which was a world-wide publicity of
the dangers accompany engineering trade in Russia. The trial has thrown
vivid searchlight upon the way the government treats foreign experts. The
natural reaction in a foreign firm is: “How can we trade with people who treat
the representatives of a first-class company in such a disgraceful way?”
The third degree methods employed in the trial and the invalid nature of the
evidence obtained by terrorising Russians have also damaged the Soviet
Government in foreign eyes.
consequence of the trial which the O.G.P.U. did not foresee was the barrier it
put in the way of American recognition. President Roosevelt seemed in
favour of entering upon diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, but the
Moscow trial has alarmed the American, and that goal of Soviet foreign
policy-American recognition-is now farther away than ever.
consequence unforeseen by the O.G.P.U. is the prohibition of 80 per cent. of
imports from Russia, which was proclaimed yesterday. Next week the import
of petroleum, wheat, butter, raw cotton, timber, and other commodities will be
banned. This will deal a severe blow at Soviet foreign trade, for Great
Britain has been Russia’s greatest market. Usually, almost one-third of
the Soviet exports have come to the United Kingdom. In 1931 the Soviet
Union sold to Britain goods to the value of £32,000,000, and bought from
Britain £9,000,000 worth of goods.
The ban on timber
from Russia may lead to difficulties, in view of large contracts which have been
signed and in of the suitability of Russian timber for British needs. Among the
items banned are pit-props and pit-wood.
The banning of
foodstuffs will probably not change the situation greatly, for the export of
foodstuffs will, in any case decline rapidly on account of the massacre of
cattle and of the ruin of agriculture in Russia.
EFFECTS OF THE EMBARGO
Some of the
effects of the embargo will be unfortunate. The shipping trade between
British ports and Russia will be adversely affected. The shutting off of
the British market will cause the Soviet Government great difficulties in
meeting obligations abroad, and this will hurt British businessmen who are owed
money by Russia. Moreover it will hasten Russian default in Germany, and
this will endanger the German budgetary situation. Little did the O.G.P.U.
think of the world-wide political and economic consequences of their sudden
descent upon the British engineers’ lodgings in Moscow.

from Russia may lead to difficulties, in view of large contracts which have been
signed and in of the suitability of Russian timber for British needs. Among the
items banned are pit-props and pit-wood.
The banning of
foodstuffs will probably not change the situation greatly, for the export of
foodstuffs will, in any case decline rapidly on account of the massacre of
cattle and of the ruin of agriculture in Russia.
EFFECTS OF THE EMBARGO
Some of the
effects of the embargo will be unfortunate. The shipping trade between
British ports and Russia will be adversely affected. The shutting off of
the British market will cause the Soviet Government great difficulties in
meeting obligations abroad, and this will hurt British businessmen who are owed
money by Russia. Moreover it will hasten Russian default in Germany, and
this will endanger the German budgetary situation. Little did the O.G.P.U.
think of the world-wide political and economic consequences of their sudden
descent upon the British engineers’ lodgings in Moscow.

When I was 15, I bought a sailboat. I had saved money all summer from working at a summer camp to be able afford it, and it seemed like the best use of the money.
Now, to clarify, this sailboat looks a lot more like a surfboard with a sail than the image that “sailboat” normally conjures. It’s small, suited for one, maybe two, people, and has clear signs of wear from the previous owner. But it’s mine, and I love it more than this post will do justice.
But alright, a 15-year-old with one summer’s earnings, why a sail boat?
Nothing is more incredible than tapping into natural energies to move. I know this sounds like a latent environmentalist message, but it’s not.
It’s just that when you harness the power of the wind, you totally feel like a Norse god.
When you go out in a kayak or canoe, you have to exert your own energy, when you go out in a motorboat, you have to exert some long-dead and fossilized animal or plant’s energy, but when you go out in a sailboat, you use nothing but the wind.
It’s absolutely exhilarating to sail

pinion have
much effect on the Bolsheviks’ policy. The young Communists and the
members of the party will see in the trial an explanation for the breakdowns in
industry. But the rest of the country will only think and talk of one
O.G.P.U. blundered most was in its ignorance of foreign countries. It did
not foresee the first result of the trial which was a world-wide publicity of
the dangers accompany engineering trade in Russia. The trial has thrown
vivid searchlight upon the way the government treats foreign experts. The
natural reaction in a foreign firm is: “How can we trade with people who treat
the representatives of a first-class company in such a disgraceful way?”
The third degree methods employed in the trial and the invalid nature of the
evidence obtained by terrorising Russians have also damaged the Soviet
Government in foreign eyes.
consequence of the trial which the O.G.P.U. did not foresee was the barrier it
put in the way of American recognition. President Roosevelt seemed in
favour of entering upon diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, but the
Moscow trial has alarmed the American, and that goal of Soviet foreign
policy-American recognition-is now farther away than ever.
consequence unforeseen by the O.G.P.U. is the prohibition of 80 per cent. of
imports from Russia, which was proclaimed yesterday. Next week the import
of petroleum, wheat, butter, raw cotton, timber, and other commodities will be
banned. This will deal a severe blow at Soviet foreign trade, for Great
Britain has been Russia’s greatest market. Usually, almost one-third of
the Soviet exports have come to the United Kingdom. In 1931 the Soviet
Union sold to Britain goods to the value of £32,000,000, and bought from
Britain £9,000,000 worth of goods.
The ban on timber
from Russia may lead to difficulties, in view of large contracts which have been
signed and in of the suitability of Russian timber for British needs. Among the
items banned are pit-props and pit-wood.
The banning of
foodstuffs will probably not change the situation greatly, for the export of
foodstuffs will, in any case decline rapidly on account of the massacre of
cattle and of the ruin of agriculture in Russia.
EFFECTS OF THE EMBARGO
Some of the
effects of the embargo will be unfortunate. The shipping trade between
British ports and Russia will be adversely affected. The shutting off of
the British market will cause the Soviet Government great difficulties in
meeting obligations abroad, and this will hurt British businessmen who are owed
money by Russia. Moreover it will hasten Russian default in Germany, and
this will endanger the German budgetary situation. Little did the O.G.P.U.
think of the world-wide political and economic consequences of their sudden
descent upon the British engineers’ lodgings in Moscow.

We are a commune of inquiring, skeptical, politically centrist, capitalist, anglophile, traditionalist New England Yankee humans, humanoids, and animals with many interests beyond and above politics. Each of us has had a high-school education (or GED), but all had ADD so didn't pay attention very well, especially the dogs. Each one of us does "try my best to be just like I am," and none of us enjoys working for others, including for Maggie, from whom we receive neither a nickel nor a dime. Freedom from nags, cranks, government, do-gooders, control-freaks and idiots is all that we ask for.

Pic: Just back from his vacation, the big guy feels fresh and invigorated.
As I've noted in past NASA posts, I've been a huge fan of the space program from the beginning, and have watched all of the major launches over the years. When Story Musgrave and his valiant crew fixed the Hubble back in '93, I was hitting the sack at 9 in the evening and getting up at 3 to watch it live.
Then the bad news started trickling in.
The problem is that they've had half a century to deal with the first problem, and that ol' 'treadmill routine' just isn't cutting it. And they're just as clueless — if not just as helpless — with the second problem.
So it's actually kind of sad to see articles like these floating around, misleading people into thinking that whole 'space exploration' business is doable at this point in time:
"Well, we're all blind and too weak to lift a finger — but we made it!"
It was 1973 and I was working at a high-end stereo shop in Keene, NH. Owning a 12-string, I was obviously very intimate with guitar-tuning. This was the dawn of PC chips, remember, and suddenly one came out that could 'read' audio frequencies. It occurred to me that you could incorporate twelve of them to look for a specific frequency and send a plus or minus signal to a mini-servomotor attached to each tuning key, telling it to turn one direction or the other. You'd strum the guitar once and they'd all kick into gear.
He's threatening you.
Since it's Sunday and we're just horsing around, I'll run through his little list, just for practice:
Tornadoes — We're currently at a 10-year low in twister activity — despite an ever-mounting rise of 'killer carbon', CO2.
Hurricanes — Also at an historic low, and some global climatologists are now starting to think that warmer waters reduce the number and strength of hurricanes.
Droughts — Our current drought is nothing compared to the barn-burner of the Dust Bowl 30's.
Coastal Flooding — Ah, you can always tell somebody who grew up in a landlocked state. It's like he's never even seen an oceanside beach. He's picturing the entire surrounding land mass as being at or near sea level, whereupon a few-feet rise in ocean level would devastate everything for miles around. Yet San Francisco, for example, surrounded on three sides by water and obviously one of the first to be washed away, is 15 feet above sea level.
Hold on, this just in:
Where we we? Oh, right.
Wildfires — We have definitely seen bigger and bigger wildfires in recent times, and will continue to do so. And it has everything to do with poor brush management and the poor clearing of old timber and not maintaining a proper airborne fleet and nothing to do with the weather.
Mass Extinctions — As I point out in my own AGW treatise, the funny thing about the "species dying off" meme is that we have absolutely no friggin' idea how many species there are. So, if you don't have a starting number, how do you know when there are "less"?
But the real point is that there isn't any reason to think masses of species will die off simply because it gets a bit warmer. Colder, yeah, but warmer? And for those on the cusp who actually do die out, a lesser species will find the warmer temp a boon and flourish. Nature's real big on that 'balance' stuff.
On a personal note, however, I have to thank the AGW crowd for giving me the opportunity to wri

What action is Kanye West's law firm taking regarding the contract with Gap
------------correct----------------------
For weeks, Kanye West, who also goes by Ye, has taken to Instagram to express his frustration with various brands.
Now, it appears, he’s doing something about it.
West’s lawyers are terminating the contract between his company Yeezy, and clothing retailer Gap, according CNBC.
The letter states that the retailer failed to meet its obligations in the agreement.
Gap was reportedly required to sell 40% of the Yeezy Gap assortment in brick-and-mortar retail stores during the third and fourth quarters of 2021, according to the Wall Street Journal.
“Yeezy notified Gap of its concerns in August and gave the company a contractually-designated 30 days to cure its breaches,” said Nicholas Gravante, a lawyer

Trying out vegan dark chocolate. Liked it, but I prefer the individually packaged ones.
Posted by Reviewer3257094 on Jul 13, 2015
There is something strange about this product. It does not taste bad, but it is not pleasant either. It seems like it was sweetened with a bad stevia extract, but they supposedly use sugar. I get a strange aftertaste, not bitter, just unpleasant.

What kinds of activities and interests characterize the commune discussed in the text
------------correct----------------------
We are a commune of inquiring, skeptical, politically centrist, capitalist, anglophile, traditionalist New England Yankee humans, humanoids, and animals with many interests beyond and above politics. Each of us has had a high-school education (or GED), but all had ADD so didn't pay attention very well, especially the dogs. Each one of us does "try my best to be just like I am," and none of us enjoys working for others, including for Maggie, from whom we receive neither a nickel nor a dime. Freedom from nags, cranks, government, do-gooders, control-freaks and idiots is all that we ask for.

Pic: Just back from his vacation, the big guy feels fresh and invigorated.
As I've noted in past NASA posts, I've been a huge fan of the space program from the beginning, and have watched all of the major launches over the years. When Story Musgrave and his valiant crew fixed the Hubble back in '93, I was hitting the sack at 9 in the evening and getting up at 3 to watch it live.
Then the bad news started trickling in.
The problem is that they've had half a century to deal with the first problem, and that ol' 'treadmill routine' just isn't cutting it. And they're just as clueless — if not just as helpless — with the second problem.
So it's actually kind of sad to see articles like these floating around, misleading people into thinking that whole 'space exploration' business is doable at this point in time:
"Well, we're all blind and too weak to lift a finger — but we made it!"
It was 1973 and I was working at a high-end stereo shop in Keene, NH. Owning a 12-string, I was obviously very intimate with guitar-tuning. This was the dawn of PC chips, remember, and suddenly one came out that could 'read' audio frequencies. It occurred to me that you could incorporate twelve of them to look for a specific frequency and send a plus or minus signal to a mini-servomotor attached to each tuning key, telling it to turn one direction or the other. You'd strum the guitar once and they'd all kick into gear.
He's threatening you.
Since it's Sunday and we're just horsing around, I'll run through his little list, just for practice:
Tornadoes — We're currently at a 10-year low in twister activity — despite an ever-mounting rise of 'killer carbon', CO2.
Hurricanes — Also at an historic low, and some global climatologists are now starting to think that warmer waters reduce the number and strength of hurricanes.
Droughts — Our current drought is nothing compared to the barn-burner of the Dust Bowl 30's.
Coastal Flooding — Ah, you can always tell somebody who grew up in a landlocked state. It's like he's never even seen an oceanside beach. He's picturing the entire surrounding land mass as being at or near sea level, whereupon a few-feet rise in ocean level would devastate everything for miles around. Yet San Francisco, for example, surrounded on three sides by water and obviously one of the first to be washed away, is 15 feet above sea level.
Hold on, this just in:
Where we we? Oh, right.
Wildfires — We have definitely seen bigger and bigger wildfires in recent times, and will continue to do so. And it has everything to do with poor brush management and the poor clearing of old timber and not maintaining a proper airborne fleet and nothing to do with the weather.
Mass Extinctions — As I point out in my own AGW treatise, the funny thing about the "species dying off" meme is that we have absolutely no friggin' idea how many species there are. So, if you don't have a starting number, how do you know when there are "less"?
But the real point is that there isn't any reason to think masses of species will die off simply because it gets a bit warmer. Colder, yeah, but warmer? And for those on the cusp who actually do die out, a lesser species will find the warmer temp a boon and flourish. Nature's real big on that 'balance' stuff.
On a personal note, however, I have to thank the AGW crowd for giving me the opportunity to wri

This past weekend, Randall’s Island in New York City hosted the third annual Governors Ball music festival. Indie music fans joined classic rock and hip hop lovers for three days of incredible music highlighted by sets from Kanye West, Alt-J, Kings of Leon, Guns N’ Roses, The xx, and Grizzly Bear (as well as a shit ton of mud, which you’ll hear more about below). For quick facts about the festival, our awards, and gorgeous photos by Luis Ruiz, keep scrolling!
The setup: Hosted on New York City’s Randall’s Island, Governors Ball was a three-day festival featuring tons of amazing artists including Alt-J, ON AN ON, Kanye West, Kings of Leon, Haim, and The xx. In the three years its existed, Governors Ball has grown unlike any festival I’ve ever witnessed. The two stages at last year’s fest were replaced by four massive stages which were all close enough to walk between in under 10 minutes. This year saw an extra emphasis on the food — more amazing vendors than ever got involved and surrounded all stages with the smells of pure heaven (if you could smell it through the mud).
Weather: If you read anything at all about this past weekend, you know we got quite the storm here in New York. It rained the entire day on Friday which turned the grassy fields of the park into a pit of 6-12 inch deep smelly mud. While it only rained on Friday, the rest of the weekend saw the repercussions.
Food options: As I mentioned above, there were more food options than ever this year. The stages were surrounded by food stands and trucks, all serving different creative cuisines from New York based restaurants such as Crif Dog, Rickshaw Dumping Bar, Porchetta, Luke’s, and Arancini Bros. It might have been expensive, but the food was all well worth heading to the festival hungry.
Overall crowdedness: As could have been expected, the rain kept some people away on Friday, and likely the rest of the weekend. By Kanye West’s set on Sunday, however, it looked as if all the ticket-holders made it out. While it was super busy, it was never uncomfortably packed and most importantly, the bathroom line never took more than 10 minutes. Ugh, I don’t want to think about those bathrooms ever again.
Not your festival if: If you don’t like the smell, sight, and/or feeling of mud, you would have been miserable this weekend. If not for the mud, though, there really weren’t many things not to like. I highly suggest this festival to anyone who likes great music.
Unnecessary visual effects: While the main stage at the festival has 3 mega screens set up for Kanye West’s set, they really didn’t do anything to help out the thousands of people that had to stand in the distance. The video footage of Kanye was psychedelic looking — they used what looks like low-budget iPhoto/Photo Booth effect as make the screens useless.
Best set from converting Kanye fans to indie-lovers: We were in a prime spot for the Kanye set, which just so hap

For weeks, Kanye West, who also goes by Ye, has taken to Instagram to express his frustration with various brands.
Now, it appears, he’s doing something about it.
West’s lawyers are terminating the contract between his company Yeezy, and clothing retailer Gap, according CNBC.
The letter states that the retailer failed to meet its obligations in the agreement.
Gap was reportedly required to sell 40% of the Yeezy Gap assortment in brick-and-mortar retail stores during the third and fourth quarters of 2021, according to the Wall Street Journal.
“Yeezy notified Gap of its concerns in August and gave the company a contractually-designated 30 days to cure its breaches,” said Nicholas Gravante, a lawyer

What action did Kanye West take regarding his agreement with Gap
------------correct----------------------
for Kanye West.
Following the notice, he said Gap took no action. The termination letter was sent to the company on Thursday.
Gravante told CNBC that Gap’s noncompliance with the agreement has cost him money and that “Ye will now promptly move forward to make up for lost time by opening Yeezy retail stores.”
In June 2020, the two brands announced a 10-year partnership, which many believed was a breath of fresh air for the struggling retailer.
Their first collaboration was a $200 blue-round coat, which ended up being an instant hit.
The “DONDA” rapper’s most recent line was a collaboration with Balenciaga that he sold through Gap.
KTLA has reached out to Gap for a comment, but have yet to hear back

ple go the solar park could absorb all the energy from the sun.

Funny since the city is surrounded by forests and farmland.
The interest in building the solar farm in Woodland comes from its proximity to an electrical substation. Representatives of the company that wants to develop the solar farm, Strata Solar Company, have tried every means to convince the neighbors that the project will not cause cancer or absorb all of the sunlight. But eventually democracy prevailed and with 1 vote for and 3 against, the construction was rejected.

What consequences is Hamza Kashgari facing due to his comments on Twitter regarding Prophet Mohammed's birthday
------------correct----------------------
Saudi writer Hamza Kashgari
has been placed in a detention center in Riyadh, following his forcible return from Malaysia. The 23-year-old writer, who is deemed to have written blasphemous remarks on Twitter on the occasion of Prophet Mohammed's birthday, has been vilified in Saudi, where hard line religious clerics are baying for his blood by demanding his execution.
Now the Saudi Arabian authorities are even threatening those who would seek to speak out in support of Kashgari. According to Death Penalty News
the state prosecutor in Jeddah who is preparing to file a case against Kashgari "has also called for others who have replied in encouragement or agreement to Hamza Kashgari’s Twitter remarks to be prosecuted."
Authorities have not stated what punishment they would intend for anyone speaking in Kashgari's defence, but are quite clear on the punishment due to the writer if found guilty of apostasy. Saudi cleric Sheikh Saleh bin Fowzan

I’m good mate, just been a very busy month with my cd out but its been good.
In my opinion you are on of the best grime producers in grime atm. Is there any other producers you like ?
Thanks man. theres so many producers who are making good music right now, i will name a few Silencer,Swindle,Terror Danjah, Joker,
Sukhnight theres much more but thats just a few names.
Why did you start producing ?
I used to listen to alot of pirate radio back in the days (dejaVu) and the music getting played use to inspire me tunes by rapid and jammer.
then one day i was given a programme to make beats and i started from there.
Is there any big influences for you in the grime scene ?
Not really you know, but i do watch how hard people work and that makes me wanna work extra harder.
What software do you use to make beats ?
I use FruityLoops since ive started and i still use it. i dont think i will ever stop using it. i no how to use
cubase and logic aswell. but i just perfer to use what i no best.
Eletric is my most favourite instrumentals of all time how long did it take and did you know it would be as big as it was ?
I think thats alot of peoples favourite tune right now, it didn’t take me that long to make maybe a few hours. i didnt
think it would be big as it is now, like for producers and mc’s you dont really know which one your tunes is gonna be big.
but everyone who i showed the beat to were going crazy so i knew the beat was something special.
Who is your most favourite artist atm ?
Right now i dont have just one favourite theres bare of them Skepta, Pmoney, D Double E, Wiley too many to name hahah
How do you come up with the name of the songs if they are just beats ? if you get me ?

made because i see aftershave on my desk, i just name them randomly to be honest. before i use to proper sit down

Wanda from Hyattsville, Md writes
I purchased the bedlam spray and the sterifab, also the boxspring and mattress encasements. Last night I saw two bedbugs on my sheets. Aren't the encasements suppose to keep the off of my bed?
Encasements do not keep bedbugs from crawling onto your bed. They keep the bedbugs from infesting your mattress and boxspring and the encasements make it easier to inspect your bed for signs of bedbugs. You should move your bed away fro

What recent findings from the Feb. 15 X-ray flash conflict with the popular theory regarding X-ray flashes and gamma-ray bursts
------------correct----------------------
uce the X-ray flashes," Lamb explained.
The Feb. 15 X-ray flash, designated XRF 050215b, has yielded the best data ever on this phenomenon, thanks to the joint observations of the two NASA satellites. The next-best data come from a flash known as XRF 020427, detected in April 2002 by the Italian BeppoSAX satellite. Three characteristics of both flashes conflict with a popular theory that X-ray flashes are gamma-ray bursts as viewed from slightly off to the side of the jet instead of head on.
First, according to the popular theory, scientists expected the energy levels of an X-ray flash's afterglow to connect smoothly on a gradient with the energy of the burst itself. Second, they expected the afterglow to fade fast. And third, they expected the afterglow to be faint when compared to the original burst.
These expectations all follow from Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity, but none of them have panned out. Scientists apparently cannot rely on special relativity to explain X-ray flashes, Lamb said.
The satellite observations also conflict with the theory that the shape of the jets from a gamma-ray burst are universal, but only look different because of the viewing angle. Based on this theory, scientists would have predicted that the afterglow of the Feb. 15 X-ray flash afterglow would have faded within a day or so following the initial burst. But the afterglow showed now signs of fading even five days following the burst.
One theory suggests that all three types of explosions contain the same amount of energy, but that the opening angle of the jet emitted from the explosions defines their apparent brightness.
In this scenario, narrow jets produce the gamma-ray bursts, wider jets result in X-ray rich gamma-ray bursts, and the broadest lead to X-ray flashes. Lamb and many others view this theory as a possibility. "There's a lot of people who don't or are not at all sure," he said.
The question could probably be settled within the next few years with more burst observations conducted jointly between the Swift and HETE-2 satellites, which measure slightly different properties of the phenomena. But NASA plans to discontinue the HETE-2 mission this September.
NASA would somehow need to find an additional $1.5 million annually to keep HETE-2 operating. "It's not the best budgetary climate to try to pull this thing off," Lamb said. But if NASA somehow manages to do it, "The HETE mission would leverage the science that Swift could do by a significant amount," he said.

What food vendors were present at the Governors Ball music festival
------------correct----------------------
GRAPHICS BY LISA ITO
This past weekend, Randall’s Island in New York City hosted the third annual Governors Ball music festival. Indie music fans joined classic rock and hip hop lovers for three days of incredible music highlighted by sets from Kanye West, Alt-J, Kings of Leon, Guns N’ Roses, The xx, and Grizzly Bear (as well as a shit ton of mud, which you’ll hear more about below). For quick facts about the festival, our awards, and gorgeous photos by Luis Ruiz, keep scrolling!
The setup: Hosted on New York City’s Randall’s Island, Governors Ball was a three-day festival featuring tons of amazing artists including Alt-J, ON AN ON, Kanye West, Kings of Leon, Haim, and The xx. In the three years its existed, Governors Ball has grown unlike any festival I’ve ever witnessed. The two stages at last year’s fest were replaced by four massive stages which were all close enough to walk between in under 10 minutes. This year saw an extra emphasis on the food — more amazing vendors than ever got involved and surrounded all stages with the smells of pure heaven (if you could smell it through the mud).
Weather: If you read anything at all about this past weekend, you know we got quite the storm here in New York. It rained the entire day on Friday which turned the grassy fields of the park into a pit of 6-12 inch deep smelly mud. While it only rained on Friday, the rest of the weekend saw the repercussions.
Food options: As I mentioned above, there were more food options than ever this year. The stages were surrounded by food stands and trucks, all serving different creative cuisines from New York based restaurants such as Crif Dog, Rickshaw Dumping Bar, Porchetta, Luke’s, and Arancini Bros. It might have been expensive, but the food was all well worth heading to the festival hungry.
Overall crowdedness: As could have been expected, the rain kept some people away on Friday, and likely the rest of the weekend. By Kanye West’s set on Sunday, however, it looked as if all the ticket-holders made it out. While it was super busy, it was never uncomfortably packed and most importantly, the bathroom line never took more than 10 minutes. Ugh, I don’t want to think about those bathrooms ever again.
Not your festival if: If you don’t like the smell, sight, and/or feeling of mud, you would have been miserable this weekend. If not for the mud, though, there really weren’t many things not to like. I highly suggest this festival to anyone who likes great music.
Unnecessary visual effects: While the main stage at the festival has 3 mega screens set up for Kanye West’s set, they really didn’t do anything to help out the thousands of people that had to stand in the distance. The video footage of Kanye was psychedelic looking — they used what looks like low-budget iPhoto/Photo Booth effect as make the screens useless.
Best set from converting Kanye fans to indie-lovers: We were in a prime spot for the Kanye set, which just so hap

Hair Loss, Even Celebrities Have Addressed This Topic, Yet There Are Not Many Blogs About It
Did you know that as women get older, they will experience hair loss? A lot of Hollywood celebrities have spoken up about hair loss in women. And that has raised awareness because before, women just used to suffer in silence. Speaking to Wall Street Journal, former supermodel, talk show host, and former America’s Next Super Model host Tyra Banks, she narrated how she got alopecia as a result of stress due to pressure of working on her Model land novel.
She fought tears as she spoke about how stressed she got to a point where she could not even appreciate the beauty of the view of the ocean.

Men Wellness Is Another Low Competition Niche

In this blog niche, you can promote all kinds of guy related products, including gadgets, sports equipment, men fashion, men jewelry, you will have lots of products and even books, and there is lots of room to expand and grow your website.
Although people think that most blog niches are saturated, you can still find some niches that are not as competitive as the popular niches. But also keep in mind that you can also take a competitive niche and narrow it down to create a small spot for yourself.
Then you can grow your blog and expand gradually. Anyway, I hope you have found my list helpful, and I also hope that you will find a topic that you can build your blog around.

In this blog niche, you can promote all kinds of guy related products, including gadgets, sports equipment, men fashion, men jewelry, you will have lots of products and even books, and there is lots of room to expand and grow your website.
Although people think that most blog niches are saturated, you can still find some niches that are not as competitive as the popular niches. But also keep in mind that you can also take a competitive niche and narrow it down to create a small spot for yourself.
Then you can grow your blog and expand gradually. Anyway, I hope you have found my list helpful, and I also hope that you will find a topic that you can build your blog around.
Thank you so much for your time, and don’t forget to leave me a comment and tell me out of these niches which one caught your eye?

Catholic Charities USA's Rev. Clarence Williams Honored by National
Pastoral Life Center
New York, NY-At a gala in New York City last night to celebrate its 25th
Anniversary, the National Pastoral Life Center honored Catholic
Charities USA's Rev. Clarence Williams, CPPS, PhD, with its Monsignor
Philip J. Murnion Faith in Culture Award for his outstanding
contribution to the Catholic Church.
"I am delighted that Father Clarence Williams is receiving the Msgr.
Philip Murnion Faith in Culture Award," said Rev. John E. Hurley, CSP,
executive director of National Pastoral Life Center. "When one thinks of
celebrating the richness of ethnic diversity, Father Clarence comes to
my mind immediately. He enables those willing to open their eyes to see
the diverse blessings that come from one other. He reminds us that no
culture is better than another and each has its history, its anguish,
shortcomings, and blessings. His voice is a blessing in our church and
At Catholic Charities USA (CCUSA), Father Williams develops and conducts
comprehensive diversity and racial equality training for local agencies,
recommends CCUSA positions on diversity that best serve CCUSA and its
member agencies, and shares his Racial Sobriety approach for race
relations within the Catholic Charities network.
Most recently, Father Williams was instrumental in helping CCUSA develop
its paper, Poverty and Racism: Overlapping Threats to the Common Good
and launch a new Web page, E Pluribus Unum-Latin for "out of many, one."
This page promotes and facilitates conversation on poverty and racism.
"Msgr. Philip Murnion's passion for the inclusion of those on the
margins of parish communities was a light to - and a fire for - my
pastoral ministry over a 20-year period," Father Williams said. "I find
myself overwhelmed with the idea of receiving an award in his honor.
Receiving the award is a challenge to hold up the torch of his vision
which invites all people to take their place at the table of the Lord."
Father Williams joins four other Catholic professionals who were honored
for their outstanding contributions to the fields of media, culture, and
parish life, including Washington Post syndicated columnist, E.J.
Dionne, Jr.; actress, Agnes Nixon; executive director of the Hispanic
Catholic Center, Rudy Vargas, IV; and writer and advocate, Monsignor
Harry J.

From: University of Chicago
Posted: Wednesday, June 1, 2005
Observations of a cosmic explosion detected on Feb. 15 by two NASA satellites have thrown into doubt one popular explanation for such explosions and have also seriously weakened the argument for yet another, according to University of Chicago astrophysicist Don Lamb. But solving the mystery any time soon may be forestalled by plans to shut down one of the satellites in September.
The explosion in question is a powerful burst of X-rays called an X-ray flash that was observed by NASA's Swift and High Energy Transient Explorer-2 satellites. X-ray flashes seem to be related to gamma-ray bursts, the most powerful explosions in the universe. "No one understands this relationship at all. It's a complete mystery," said Lamb, the Louis Block Professor in Astronomy & Astrophysics at the University of Chicago and a member of the HETE-2 science team.
Lamb presents some ideas on the relationship of X-ray flashes to gamma-ray bursts during a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Minneapolis. The co-authors of his paper are Tim Donaghy, a Ph.D. student in physics, and Carlo Graziani, Senior Research Associate in Astronomy & Astrophysics, both at the University of Chicago.
Discovered in 1969, Gamma-ray bursts last anywhere from fractions of a second to many minutes and pack the output of as many as 1,000 exploding stars. They occur almost daily, come from any direction in the sky, and are followed by afterglows that are visible for a few days at X-ray and optical wavelengths.
Discovered in 2000, X-ray flashes seem to form the less powerful end of a continuum of cosmic explosions that progresses to X-ray rich gamma-ray bursts and then culminates in gamma-ray bursts proper. All three phenomena occur in approximately equal numbers.
"We think that regular gamma-ray bursts are all produced by the collapse of massive stars and probably the creation of black holes," Lamb said. "I personally think it's essentially a certainty that X-ray flashes are produced by the same kind of event."
But exactly how that occurs remains a matter of speculation. One possibility is that a varying rotation rate of the collapsed core of these massive stars produces different opening angles of the jets emitted from the bursts. "Maybe sometimes they're rotating rapidly and you get narrow jets and other times they're rotating less rapidly and you get wider X-ray rich jets and sometimes they're rotating still more slowly and you get very broad jets that prod

O.G.P.U.’s BLOW TO TRADE
- - -
MOSCOW TRIAL ONE OF THE BIGGEST BLUNDERS IN HISTORY
Foreign Trade Wrecked by Fanatical Suspicion
By Gareth Jones
The trial of the
British engineers in Moscow will rank as one of the biggest blunders of
history. The false step which the O.G.P.U. (the State Political Police)
blindly took when they ordered the arrest of the six Britons has had results
greatly damaging to the Soviet Union. The O.G.P.U. went about the frame-up
without consulting anybody. Its officials left the Soviet Foreign Office
in the dark and sprang the trumped-up charges upon an astonished Soviet
Foreign office could not fight against the O.G.P.U., which is now all-powerful,
and had to defend the O.G.P.U. action in public, while probably cursing it in
What the O.G.P.U.
did in keeping with the Bolshevik mentality. It was motivated by a great
fear of the capitalist nations. According to the Bolsheviks, the
capitalists are ever plotting the overthrow of the Soviet Union and send swarms
of spies to Russia.
America are preparing war on the Soviet Union. The Pope and the Hitlerites
are allies in preparing to attack the Soviet Union.”
Those are typical
propaganda posters which one sees everywhere. This fear of capitalist
attack is deeply impressed on the Russian mind, for the Bolsheviks credulously
accept Lenin’s prophecy that the war between Capitalism and Communism is bound
to come. What wonder that most British experts or observers going to
Russia are suspected of being spies?
The O.G.P.U. is
fanatical in another of its suspicions, namely, the relations between British
people and the Intelligence Service. The Bolsheviks really believe that
Scotland Yard (which they confuse with the British Intelligence Service) is an
all-powerful force dominating British life. Scotland Yard, in their
imaginations, is the exact equivalent of the O.G.P.U. and has every man and
woman and child under its control.
have been taught to believe that every British subject going abroad has to report
to Scotland Yard, has to have special permission to leave the country, and has
to call at Scotland with military information on his return to England. In
pre-war days the Tsarist police were also suspicious concerning the character of
the foreigners who entered Russia.
FANTASTIC BUT TRUE
The O.G.P.U. was
also fanatically-minded in its suspicion of sabotage. The wrecking of
machines has been a frequent crime both in Tsarist and Bolshevik Russia.
Although the accusation strikes as fantastic, sabotage is quite a natural idea
to Russians. Much valuable machinery has been wrecked by wilful damaging
by Russians who hate the Bolshevik system.
O.G.P.U.’s blunder was natural one in view of Russian history and of Russian
mentality. The O.G.P.U.’s disregard of human life is also natural in
view of Russian character. Human life has never been of much stock in
Russia, and the rights of the individual have always been scorned by the ruling
class, whether Tsarist or Bolshevik. Nor will Russian public o

------------answer-----------------------
pened to be the stage that Grizzly Bear played. As usual, the band was absolutely incredible, but what was most entertaining about the set was the crowd filled with hip hop fanatics who couldn’t help but get into “Two Weeks”. Heads were bobbing everywhere.
Get a new sound guy: Sorry Beirut, but your set was all but lost at Governors Ball. Your delightful folk pop was way too bass-y, making the lyrics incoherent. For anyone who was seeing Beirut for the first time, try and see them again, they really can be incredible.
Best quote: Towards the end of a rain-soaked Friday, we were making our way to the refuge of the SKYY Vodka tent for whoever the hell was playing. We were excited for Eryka Badu, but it really didn’t matter who was playing, we just wanted to get out of the monsoon. And this is the exact moment our friend uttered the quote of the festival, “everyone would be under that tent even if Limp Bizkit were playing.” So true, Daniel Topete.
Best dessert: This one’s a no-brainer! Brooklyn’s Arancini Bros had a stand set up and had a ton of savory fried rice balls for sale. But it was their nutella-filled, cinnamon and sugar coated ball that won our hearts. It was seriously one of the best treats I’ve had my entire life. A close runner up was the free samples from Ben & Jerry’s.
Best set: Though there were countless amazing sets at Governors Ball, it was Haim (officially pronounced Hi-um) that stole the show. These chicks are unstoppable and captivated the massive crowd that was out in full-force to see them on the main stage. You need to see them as soon as you possibly can.
Best set (other than Haim): Having seen Twin Shadow over a year ago and simply enjoying his set, I wasn’t as excited as I should have been for his Governors Ball appearance. Since releasing his 2012 album, Confess, his set has been injected with tons of guitar, which take the place of dreamy synths that I personally thought were overkill. This set blew me away and sold me on Brooklyn based artist who’ll likely play the main stage whenever he releases his next record.
Worst muddy repercussions: This award should be going to the grass fields on Randall’s Island, or rather the muddy hell that replaced them after a day and night of torrential rain, if it were not for the Chinese bagel place in Manhattan that sits right where the bridge from Randall’s Island left the thousands of festival-goers. While they knew what they were in for, I doubt they expected to be left with a barely-recognizable bathroom and muddy brown floors. Sorry guys!
Should have been a surprise headliner: I mean, Puddle of Mudd would have made a lot of sense!
Rest in peace: The thousands and thousands of umbrellas and Sperrys lost in the mud (including mine).
Surprisingly top 40 crowd: Yeah, we all know Alt-J is incredible. But I really wasn’t expecting the bro-filled crowd that flocked to the Honda Stage on Saturday for them. It was a stunning sight to witness

What are the main concerns of motorcyclists regarding the proposed anti-tampering legislation in the EU
------------correct----------------------
Motorcyclists plan a massive demonstration outside the EU Parliament in Brussels next week ahead of a committee vote on legislation designed to prevent them from modifying their bikes
By Marc Abizeid
Dear residents of Brussels: Lock up your daughters, hide your goods and stay off the streets Tuesday. Hundreds, maybe thousands, of riled up bikers from around Europe are gearing up for a massive motorcycle rally outside the European Parliament November 22 in opposition to proposed anti-tampering motorcycle legislation.
They’re message is clear: EU, get your hands off our bikes.
But still elusive is what the legislation will actually stipulate once it’s up for a vote on December 5 among members of the parliament’s Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee which has been tasked with reshaping the law. The vote was originally scheduled for November 22 (hence the biker protest) but was pushed back in order to have more time for review.
“It’s going to be up in the air until the committee vote, and even then that’s not the final stage,” says Stephane Reynolds, assistant to British MEP Malcom Harbour, chair of the IMCO. “But the picture becomes clear after the committee vote and before the parliament (plenary) vote.”
The original draft was met with fury by European motorcyclists when it was introduced last year. The main contentions among bikers included several key provisions that would apply to motorcycles manufactured after the date of the law’s implementation.
Those provisions would: prevent riders from modifying their bikes to increase power, torque or speed outside the standards set by the manufacturer or defined by the vehicle’s category; require bikes to come with anti-lock brake systems; require on board diagnostic equipment to warn of potential malfunctions, and; require bikes to come with automatic headlight-on. The main argument in favor of the law is to improve road safety and emissions control.
So, what’s the problem?
For many motorcyclists, their bikes represent their livelihoods. They see the legislation as an attempt by the EU to take away their hobby to modify bikes and restrict their freedoms on the road.
“Motorcycles are a big part of our culture in the UK,” says British MEP Marta Andreasen who has come out in firm opposition to the law. “This legislation has no value, it will just hurt our community.”
Andreasen has even drafted a petition that would force Parliament to debate the legislation should it collect 100,000 signatures, although the petition is still far from reaching that target.
There is also the question of how the law would affect small businesses that produce after market parts for specific models. If anti-tampering becomes a reality, those businesses would likely be limited to manufacturing parts for older models.
“I find this unfair,”Andreasen adds. “I suspect it’s the result of lobbying by big companies like Bosch (which produces ABS) which would profit from this legislation.”

------------question-----------------------
What symbolic significance does the author attribute to My Little Pony in relation to their experiences as a trans woman
------------correct----------------------
Of course, if I’m going to throw a cartoon party on the internet, it’s probably worth talking a little bit about why I happen to love that cartoon…
I tend to fit fairly easily into a pretty standard, archetypal concept most people have of what a transsexual woman is and is supposed to be like. Women like me are not by any means in the majority (in fact it’s often been pretty tough for me to find other trans women who come from a similar background), but we nonetheless tend not to fall too far outside the expectations cis people have about what transsexuality means. I’m straight (androphilic, or attracted to men), my personality and presentation fit pretty neatly into the culturally mandated female gender role and concept of femininity, I “pass” reasonably well (or more accurately, I have the privilege of usually being gendered correctly), I transitioned while still somewhat young, I never considered being non-op and keeping my male genitals to be a reasonable option for me, I took the conventional model of medical treatment, my diagnosis was easily made and my narrative fit the standard criteria, and I identify in a nice, simple, binary, easily understood, totally-female way.
The only way in which I fall outside the (horrible and internally cissexist) concept of “Harry Benjamin Syndrome” is that I previously identified as a gay man and was (a little bit) sexually active during that time. Like many of the ways I’ve gotten very lucky with my transition, fitting into cis expectations and being more or less the most easily comprehensible “type” of transsexual there is (just moving from the M box to the F box, and not clashing too much with society’s standards for that F) has made things much easier for me than they otherwise would have been. The world is a pretty hostile place for trans women who pose additional threats to cisnormative concepts of gender.
But nonetheless, I didn’t really have the archetypal childhood most cis people imagine a trans woman to have. Almost no one does. I wasn’t putting on dresses and playing with dolls and insisting I was a girl from the moment I could talk. Despite the way that many cis people imagine that is how all trans women start out in life, that kind of story is actually incredibly rare. Very few of us assert strong outward signs like that in early childhood… even those of us who came to understand our identity as female before adolescence still usually knew that we wouldn’t be accepted, that it wasn’t allowed, and we had to keep that side of ourselves secret and suppressed lest we be ridiculed or punished or disappoint our parents. We adapt and we hide. Kids are smarter than adults tend to think, they know how vulnerable they are and they want to please the people around them, especially their parents.
Besides, I didn’t have any sisters anyway, so opportunities to play with girl toys and explore femininity as an option were pretty scarce. I mostly just stuck with Lego. I liked making up my own stories and characters.
But that didn’t mean there weren’t moments where I tried to explore, and discovered the scorn with which femininity would be met. My knowing to hide beneath a male disguise wasn’t natural. It was very definitely learned. One of the ways I learned it was through My Little Pony. I liked My Little Pony.
I have a particularly vivid memory of how one day my father came into the room where we had the TV and caught me watching the MLP cartoon. I will never, ever forget the look of disappointment, frustration, confusion and most of all disgust on his face. Whether he really thought it through or not, he made it abundantly clear that it was NOT okay for me to be watching such a show, that it was indicative of there being something wrong with me, and I ought to be ashamed. I got to know that look pretty well. I encountered it many more times over the course of my childhood… the only difference being that over the years the frustration and disgust gradually sank into resignation and sadness (the disappointment and confusion remain even today).
I also remember going to a birthday party for one of my older brother’s friends (I have no idea why I was there… I guess so my parents could get a night of free babysitting and relax). The birthday boy’s older brother gave him his gift, he opened it, and discovered a My Little Pony. The assembled crowd of boys in the room laughed at him, and I instinctively knew that I was expected to laugh along: how gross and awful and horrible and hilarious that this boy would be holding a girl thing in his hands! LOL! It was my first experience of what would later come back to haunt me as the laugh track to Work It. The awful, sickening feeling of knowing you’re supposed to participate in the transphobic ridicule. The boy actually began to sob in humiliation before his brother finally revealed that it had been a joke and gave him his real gift (a Nerf gun).
I knew exactly what lesson was being taught. Kids are smart like that. It was wrong to like girl things, and if you did, you would be mocked, laughed at, hated, shunned, people would be disgusted by you, and you’d be a disappointment to your parents. And nothing was girlier than My Little Pony. I knew I was not allowed to have one, or even dare breathe that I wanted one.
As such, My Little Pony became representative to me of everything I’d been denied. All the joys, desires, and expressions of self I had been forced to hide and suppress. Everything I never got to have. The girlhood I wasn’t allowed to live, that is now lost forever. The years I never lived and the experiences I never had. A missed childhood. All of it summed up in one little toy I wished I could have asked for, and one cartoon my father caught me watching.
It’s not that I think feminine things, and girl toys, or the colour pink or whatever, are synonymous with female identity. My views are quite apart from that, though I am femme. But we all construct, imagine and express our gender with the tools we have available. The value, and the loss, was symbolic.
Years later, early in my transition, when I was a few months into hormones but still presenting as male, I spent a particular Spring morning hanging around on a trans support forum on the internet when I noticed a lot of people were using avatars from the new My Little Pony cartoon that had come out. I loved the art, I thought the ponies were adorable, and I thought it was really cool that My Little Pony was being claimed as a bit of an icon by the younger MtF community, in that for me it was such a powerful symbol for the joys of femininity, and like I said, symbolic of the things I had wished I could have had and wished I could have been but had to sacrifice, symbolic of the girlhood I missed out on. It was a nice morning.
But that day didn’t end up going very well.
At this point, I was terrified to death of coming out and what I was going to do about my roommates. I was in a rooming house, where each tenant was on an individual “lease” (actually just a xeroxed sheet of paper with several typos just saying party A agrees to give party B X dollars ever month).

How did the narrator's experience of harsh judgment from others influence their perspective on personal identity and their transition
------------correct----------------------
e strangers. I had no control over who I lived with. They were all men, all straight, and all rather macho. Most had drinking problems. There was only person who I’d yet told, and he’d reacted… interestingly (He was okay with it, but in a horribly patronizing and sexist way, and asked if he could feel my breasts. Seriously).
This roommate was named Chris. He was young and kind of hipster-ish in a really shallow way, made his living off of theft and scamming the Ministry Of Housing And Social Development, was one of the most manipulative people I’ve ever known, and drank a lot.
There was also an older roommate named James. James was a waiter at a fancy restaurant, had some pretty serious emotional issues, and also was a terrible alcoholic (as well as having a pretty huge weed habit, too). He was emphatically pro-life, extremely misogynistic, highly opinionated and domineering, and still very, very angry at an ex-girlfriend who’d aborted the child they’d conceived together twenty years ago.
I was a bit nervous about how the fuck I was going to come out to everyone and what their reactions would be, but my efforts to move out had failed miserably and I was broke. I was starting to look pretty feminine and was already experiencing male-fail (where someone in an MtF transition gets gendered female despite presenting as male). I intended to go full-time within a month or two, and just couldn’t keep it secret forever.
That afternoon, Chris invited over his pot dealer, Dave or something, to make a big sale to James. The two of them invited me out to the back porch to share a joint. I figured sure, what the heck, why not? I don’t smoke very often, but I accept it when offered. After smoking, Chris, who was sitting next to me, looked over at me and started discretely asking some trans-related questions. I indicated I wasn’t comfortable talking about any of that with James and Dave sitting right there. Chris indicated I should stop worrying and tell them. I said I wasn’t ready for that yet. Chris said he’d do it then. I told him not to. He said he was going to anyway. I begged him not to.
Chris looks over at James and Dave .“So I have this friend back in Calgary…”, he began. I was too terrified to be angry. “…and he’s like physically male but chemically female…” (my internal mental facepalm could have shamed the cosmos) “…and is going to get surgery to become a woman. What do you guys think of that?”
“Well I think that’s pretty fucked up” was Dave’s response, plainly stated. “People like that are mentally unbalanced and should be put in psychiatric hospitals.”
James just sat there looking visibly uncomfortable. “I don’t want to talk about this stuff. It creeps me out.”
I could feel my cheeks flushing with blood and heat. I knew there was absolutely no way I wasn’t going to tip myself off through body language alone, so I bolted, making up an excuse about munchies, and headed off for a quick walk.
When I got back, conversation halted, Chris wore a smirk, and Dave and James stared at me in bewilderment, morbid curiosity, fear and disgust. That was a look that, like my father’s, I would come to know pretty well. I knew within seconds what had happened. The moment after I left, Chris had revealed the identity of his “friend in Calgary”. He’d outed me.
I hid in my room for the duration of the afternoon, finally leaving in the evening when things were quiet and Dave had long since left to go grab some food from the 7/11 up the street. At the time, I was wearing a Henley t-shirt, a women’s (but unisex-enough) cropped leather jacket, girl jeans, and a pair of yellow Converse low-tops.
I grabbed a coke, a cup of frosted flakes and a Coffee Crisp and got in line. I stood in front of a really dodgy looking shaved-head white-urban-creep type dude in a really baggy camo jacket. After a few moments of standing there quietly, I heard him say, “Damn dude! Those are some UGLY fucking shoes!”
I just looked back, and gave a shrug and half-smile, not wanting to turn it into a confrontation.
A moment passed.
“I mean, really, those are like the UGLIEST fucking shoes I’ve ever seen! Where the fuck did you get shoes that ugly?!?”
I turned, smiled again, and asked “Do you make a lot of friends like this?”
“Not faggots. I don’t want any pussy faggots like you for friends.”
I turned away. I paid. I began walking home.
So this is how things were going to be from now on. I was openly hated. I was an acceptable target. A pussy faggot bitch. Mentally unbalanced and ought to be placed in a psychiatric hospital. Too weird and fucked up for people to talk about, because I’ll give them the creeps. The best I can hope for is that they might find me interesting enough to ask to feel my breasts instead of just staring in appalled silence. Cool. What an awesome life I was creating for myself. Yay. I wanted to just collapse into my bitterness and self-pity and wither away into a pile of dust and shame, then just blow away in the breeze.
And then I noticed something on the sidewalk. Just sitting there. A few feet outside my front door.
It was a My Little Pony. The kind they made back in the eighties when I was a kid. The kind I’d always wanted. And it was just sitting there on the sidewalk, waiting for me. Like a little message just for me.
A message that said no matter how many awful people there are in this world, or how much hate I was going to have deal with, this whole thing, transition, was still worth it. It was still completely the right choice. Because what it meant, far more than being a target for the scorn of a few idiots, was getting to finally be myself, finally stop suppressing and denying who I was, finally be able to do and be all the things I’d wanted, finally get to live honestly, sincerely, happily, finally not have to compromise myself for the expectations of others, finally get to give myself a life worth living, the life I’d wanted, the life I deserved. No more missed years. Finally be able to say so if I want a fucking pony.
I dusted her off, took her home and named her Serendipity.
And later I pulled open my laptop and began watching Friendship Is Magic. Which turned out to be every bit as awesome as I possibly could have hoped. As the weeks passed, I began proudly purchasing the new toys whenever I had a spare $6. That is how I fell in love with My Little Pony.
Yes, there’s all the cool, awesome, beautiful artwork and animation of Lauren Faust. And yes there’s some terrific, very positive messages in the show for girls. And yes it has some inspiring feminist elements, particularly the underlying message that there is more than one way to be a girl. And yes, the degree to which it’s been embraced and loved across demographics shows that we’ve arrived at a society much less constrained along its lines of gender than the eighties were, and makes me think about how much nicer things may now be for kids who want the “wrong” toys and like the “wrong” cartoons. That’s all true. And it makes the show terrific. But for me it’s also a lot more personal than that.
For me, it’s about one really bad day that ended on one really perfect note.

e strangers. I had no control over who I lived with. They were all men, all straight, and all rather macho. Most had drinking problems. There was only person who I’d yet told, and he’d reacted… interestingly (He was okay with it, but in a horribly patronizing and sexist way, and asked if he could feel my breasts. Seriously).
This roommate was named Chris. He was young and kind of hipster-ish in a really shallow way, made his living off of theft and scamming the Ministry Of Housing And Social Development, was one of the most manipulative people I’ve ever known, and drank a lot.
There was also an older roommate named James. James was a waiter at a fancy restaurant, had some pretty serious emotional issues, and also was a terrible alcoholic (as well as having a pretty huge weed habit, too). He was emphatically pro-life, extremely misogynistic, highly opinionated and domineering, and still very, very angry at an ex-girlfriend who’d aborted the child they’d conceived together twenty years ago.
I was a bit nervous about how the fuck I was going to come out to everyone and what their reactions would be, but my efforts to move out had failed miserably and I was broke. I was starting to look pretty feminine and was already experiencing male-fail (where someone in an MtF transition gets gendered female despite presenting as male). I intended to go full-time within a month or two, and just couldn’t keep it secret forever.
That afternoon, Chris invited over his pot dealer, Dave or something, to make a big sale to James. The two of them invited me out to the back porch to share a joint. I figured sure, what the heck, why not? I don’t smoke very often, but I accept it when offered. After smoking, Chris, who was sitting next to me, looked over at me and started discretely asking some trans-related questions. I indicated I wasn’t comfortable talking about any of that with James and Dave sitting right there. Chris indicated I should stop worrying and tell them. I said I wasn’t ready for that yet.

What experience did the author have with martial arts before practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ)
------------correct----------------------
Akido instructor, and made him take rest breaks, I used TKD. I learned Bjj from watching ufc and pride and then I copied them and wrestled my cousin for practice. I choked him out and he tapped.

And then when they actually have to fight they get the **** kicked out of them. Yes, that happens a lot. It's kindof sad. Well part of that is the way CMA was traditionally taught, taking years sometimes to get to fighting. Plus, the guys that do wushu now want to get paid for teaching forms so they breed a lot of nonsense. Not all CMA guys don't fight. There's plenty of sanshou, sanda and kuoshu tournaments. Just find a teacher that does fighting.

In the last video it ppers he is telling them not to
push the bag away, but, to pull back at contact.
This could be his version of bag control, or just some
sh*tty advice. . .who knows.

Since then, the killings haven’t stopped. First came the slaughter of 13 young people at a party last Friday in Ciudad Juarez. Then came the up-against-the-wall execution of 13 drug addicts in Tijuana on Saturday. Third came yesterday’s mass execution of 15 people at a car wash in Nayarit state.
Then this morning’s newspapers say six people were executed in the Morelos district of the capital.
Are all these killings related? I don’t know. But the Mexican media is suggesting that all may be part of retaliation. It’s pretty grisly math: one ton equals one life.

The gravity problem was solved decades ago - just spin the ship.
This Mars trip seems a bit half baked. The GDP per capita sign up fee is supposed to be high enough to make people think about it. US citizens have to pay... $38!!! Even in these depressed economic times, that fee wouldn't require much though and for some, they might figure it a small price for an exciting way to end it all.
The cost for sending the first crew is $6B! I guess they're hoping that the people who are signing up are very unpopular and that a lot of people are anxious to see them go - and never come back.
The payload for each launch is 5000 lbs. That seems pretty light considering that that would have to include the means to produce their own food. They will have to be vegetarians (this is one part that actually makes sense - lefty vegans would probably have the required intelligence to sign up for this), but how much does the equipment and supplies for large scale hydroponic farming weigh? My guess is that some of that 5000 lbs is going to be water and some way to convert waste to plant food at least - but that won't last forever. How long can you reuse that?
I think I'll sit this one out. If I can't have a cheeseburger, I'm not going!
"I think I'll sit this one out. If I can't have a cheeseburger, I'm not going!"
You and I are thinking along the exact same lines. I just skimmed the article and missed that payload number. That seems absurd, and for all the reasons you mentioned and then some.
And then there's this:
"The astronauts will undergo a required eight-year training in a secluded location."
"So, Mr. Jennings, how did your eight-year training session go?"
"Just fine, sonny! Hold on a sec while I go fetch my walker."
And then we have:
"Astronauts will filter Martian water from the Martian soil."
Hum. As far as I know, they don't even know for sure that there IS any water on Mars. There's supposed to be some kind of 'dry ice' in the polar regions, but in the soil anywhere else?
"Well, Mr. Jennings, there's good news and bad news. The good news is that they found water in the polar regions."
"Great! What's the bad news?"
"It's minus 230 degrees there."
Say, I hear Jupiter's nice this time of year.
Well, now, I do admit I used the 'sepia tone' filter to give the picture more of a rustic, authentic feeling, but I'm not sure if that actually fits the heading of 'glamorized'.
And, to be truthful, that's not the hat he usually wears around the farm. It's more of a wide-brimmed straw thing. He's wearing that hat in the pic because I told to dress up so he'd look his best.
The digital guitar tuner would be really neat if it could accommodate pre-sets for all a'them alt-tunings too, but damn, $299.00 is a bit rich. Especially when God gave us ears.
"Especially when God gave us ears."
And tuning forks and Korg electronic tuners. I keep a tuning fork stuck behind the strings above the nut in case I want to tune it on the road, but otherwise use my faithful Korg.
But that's an interesting thought about the alternate pre-set tunings. One for standard tuning, another for open-string, another with the high strings tuned a few cents up to give it that sharp, edgy 'rock' feel, another with a few strings tuned a few cents down to give it that country feel? Given that we're just talking about a PC chip, it shouldn't be that difficult to implement.
When you get the capital together and are ready to fire up our new company, let me know. :)
Here you are Doc. If you haven't read this one it's really good. When Hubble needed some more help in 2009.
Looks great (and long). I'll read it later when I have time. As far as the Hubble needing repair back in '06, I wrote a scathing report on it here. I say, can the whole thing and start over.

Rude kid is one of the biggest grime producers out their and has made name for him self for the whole grime scene, He has a album “ARE YOU READY“ out now. Rude kid came across very well in This Interview and is quite inspiring. Rude kid shows he is dedicated in the scene and is a hard working individual. This is probably one of my best interview’s yet.
Hey Rude Kid how are you today ?
I’m good mate, just been a very busy month with my cd out but its been good.
In my opinion you are on of the best grime producers in grime atm. Is there any other producers you like ?
Thanks man. theres so many producers who are making good music right now, i will name a few Silencer,Swindle,Terror Danjah, Joker,
Sukhnight theres much more but thats just a few names.
Why did you start producing ?
I used to listen to alot of pirate radio back in the days (dejaVu) and the music getting played use to inspire me tunes by rapid and jammer.
then one day i was given a programme to make beats and i started from there.
Is there any big influences for you in the grime scene ?
Not really you know, but i do watch how hard people work and that makes me wanna work extra harder.
What software do you use to make beats ?
I use FruityLoops since ive started and i still use it. i dont think i will ever stop using it. i no how to use
cubase and logic aswell. but i just perfer to use what i no best.
Eletric is my most favourite instrumentals of all time how long did it take and did you know it would be as big as it was ?
I think thats alot of peoples favourite tune right now, it didn’t take me that long to make maybe a few hours. i didnt
think it would be big as it is now, like for producers and mc’s you dont really know which one your tunes is gonna be big.
but everyone who i showed the beat to were going crazy so i knew the beat was something special.
Who is your most favourite artist atm ?
Right now i dont have just one favourite theres bare of them Skepta, Pmoney, D Double E, Wiley too many to name hahah
How do you come up with the name of the songs if they are just beats ? if you get me ?
Basically whatever i see first i name it that, for example ive got a beat called AFTERSHAVE on my CD that was
made because i see aftershave on my desk, i just name them randomly to be honest. before i use to proper sit down
and think of a name but what i clocked wa

What materials has the author collected over the years and what significance do they hold
------------correct----------------------
As I've been creating lately I've pondered the materials that I use. For 20 plus years I've been collecting fabrics, trims, odds and ends that I'm attracted to. Lately as I search through my collection I've been thinking about who owned these treasures before me. Just like me I'm sure there was an "idea" and purpose for them originally.
Recently I found several yards of the linen that you see in this pillow. Who bought this much linen and what were their plans? How old is this piece? The selvedge states that it was made in England and is preshrunk. It's the color of green that was popular in the late 70s. Perhaps curtains? Table cloth? Did it travel with a family that moved to the area? How many hands has this piece of fabric passed through?
|Crochet Yoke and Pink Flowered Linen|
Then there is the 6 yard piece of dark wool that I found at goodwill. I imagine it was meant to be a suit...for a woman or a man? A man I think, since it's very dark with a pinstripe.
What about all of the crochet doily's and linens I have collected. Boxes and boxes of them. Women were very prolific in the production of these items that decorated their homes. I keep wondering if there will ever be a time when they are difficult to

------------correct----------------------
WorldStage Newsonline-- The U-20 Women National Team, known as Falconets, departed for Korea Republic on Wednesday for a two-week final training camp ahead of this year’s FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup finals.
A delegation including 25 players flew out of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja in the morning to catch an Emirates Ariline flight to Dubai from Lagos in the afternoon, from where the contingent will proceed to Seoul on Thursday morning.
Head Coach Edwin Okon, whose girls swept past Zimbabwe and Democratic Republic of Congo in the African qualifiers without conceding a goal, said his mission is to get the reigning vice champions of the world in super competition-mood before the end of the two-week camping period.
“We have conquered Africa and now, it is time to prepare for the world. We have a massive task on our hands because the 2010 Class got to the final of the World Cup. We just have to prepare ourselves adequately to be able to go one better,” said Okon.
The Nigeria Football Federation has perfected all arrangements for the team’s two-week stay at the Namhe Sports Park,

The next cell is occupied by a very large humanoid, at least nine feet
tall; handsome with a kindly face who looks upon the company. "I have
been imprisoned wrongly." he says. "Please let me go free and your
reward will be rich."
The third cell is occupied by a tall man who, even in his loincloth,
appears to be of noble bearing. His eyes are piercing and cold, and if
he is interested in the company at all, he does not betray it.
The company is lead to the sixth cell, which is large enough for Ted
and his companions. Two guards remain inside the cell, and the rest
post themselves close by.

Alex can only sense fear and confusion, nothing surprising
considering. Still her dagger tries to pierce deeper, but it as if the
door is shut and the deeper thoughts cannot be sensed.

Justin looks disquieted and distrustful. His two dogs flank Ted,
awaiting only his command to pounce.
"We're trying to help you." he says. "Can you tell us what happened.
Why did you try to kill the king?"
A moment or two later the King and Sir Prrcyvel appear. "Well, let us
see what you can do." the King says. "Mrrlyn has been alrerted, though
why he is not here now I find a little disturbing."
They also notice for the first time that Louissa is not among them.
She had gone with Ted when he had been first taken into custody but
she is nowhere to be seen.

Of course, if I’m going to throw a cartoon party on the internet, it’s probably worth talking a little bit about why I happen to love that cartoon…
I tend to fit fairly easily into a pretty standard, archetypal concept most people have of what a transsexual woman is and is supposed to be like. Women like me are not by any means in the majority (in fact it’s often been pretty tough for me to find other trans women who come from a similar background), but we nonetheless tend not to fall too far outside the expectations cis people have about what transsexuality means. I’m straight (androphilic, or attracted to men), my personality and presentation fit pretty neatly into the culturally mandated female gender role and concept of femininity, I “pass” reasonably well (or more accurately, I have the privilege of usually being gendered correctly), I transitioned while still somewhat young, I never considered being non-op and keeping my male genitals to be a reasonable option for me, I took the conventional model of medical treatment, my diagnosis was easily made and my narrative fit the standard criteria, and I identify in a nice, simple, binary, easily understood, totally-female way.
The only way in which I fall outside the (horrible and internally cissexist) concept of “Harry Benjamin Syndrome” is that I previously identified as a gay man and was (a little bit) sexually active during that time. Like many of the ways I’ve gotten very lucky with my transition, fitting into cis expectations and being more or less the most easily comprehensible “type” of transsexual there is (just moving from the M box to the F box, and not clashing too much with society’s standards for that F) has made things much easier for me than they otherwise would have been. The world is a pretty hostile place for trans women who pose additional threats to cisnormative concepts of gender.
But nonetheless, I didn’t really have the archetypal childhood most cis people imagine a trans woman to have. Almost no one does. I wasn’t putting on dresses and playing with dolls and insisting I was a girl from the moment I could talk. Despite the way that many cis people imagine that is how all trans women start out in life, that kind of story is actually incredibly rare. Very few of us assert strong outward signs like that in early childhood… even those of us who came to understand our identity as female before adolescence still usually knew that we wouldn’t be accepted, that it wasn’t allowed, and we had to keep that side of ourselves secret and suppressed lest we be ridiculed or punished or disappoint our parents. We adapt and we hide. Kids are smarter than adults tend to think, they know how vulnerable they are and they want to please the people around them, especially their parents.
Besides, I didn’t have any sisters anyway, so opportunities to play with girl toys and explore femininity as an option were pretty scarce. I mostly just stuck with Lego. I liked making up my own stories and characters.
But that didn’t mean there weren’t moments where I tried to explore, and discovered the scorn with which femininity would be met. My knowing to hide beneath a male disguise wasn’t natural. It was very definitely learned. One of the ways I learned it was through My Little Pony. I liked My Little Pony.
I have a particularly vivid memory of how one day my father came into the room where we had the TV and caught me watching the MLP cartoon. I will never, ever forget the look of disappointment, frustration, confusion and most of all disgust on his face. Whether he really thought it through or not, he made it abundantly clear that it was NOT okay for me to be watching such a show, that it was indicative of there being something wrong with me, and I ought to be ashamed. I got to know that look pretty well. I encountered it many more times over the course of my childhood… the only difference being that over the years the frustration and disgust gradually sank into resignation and sadness (the disappointment and confusion remain even today).
I also remember going to a birthday party for one of my older brother’s friends (I have no idea why I was there… I guess so my parents could get a night of free babysitting and relax). The birthday boy’s older brother gave him his gift, he opened it, and discovered a My Little Pony. The assembled crowd of boys in the room laughed at him, and I instinctively knew that I was expected to laugh along: how gross and awful and horrible and hilarious that this boy would be holding a girl thing in his hands! LOL! It was my first experience of what would later come back to haunt me as the laugh track to Work It. The awful, sickening feeling of knowing you’re supposed to participate in the transphobic ridicule. The boy actually began to sob in humiliation before his brother finally revealed that it had been a joke and gave him his real gift (a Nerf gun).
I knew exactly what lesson was being taught. Kids are smart like that. It was wrong to like girl things, and if you did, you would be mocked, laughed at, hated, shunned, people would be disgusted by you, and you’d be a disappointment to your parents. And nothing was girlier than My Little Pony. I knew I was not allowed to have one, or even dare breathe that I wanted one.
As such, My Little Pony became representative to me of everything I’d been denied. All the joys, desires, and expressions of self I had been forced to hide and suppress. Everything I never got to have. The girlhood I wasn’t allowed to live, that is now lost forever. The years I never lived and the experiences I never had. A missed childhood. All of it summed up in one little toy I wished I could have asked for, and one cartoon my father caught me watching.
It’s not that I think feminine things, and girl toys, or the colour pink or whatever, are synonymous with female identity. My views are quite apart from that, though I am femme. But we all construct, imagine and express our gender with the tools we have available. The value, and the loss, was symbolic.
Years later, early in my transition, when I was a few months into hormones but still presenting as male, I spent a particular Spring morning hanging around on a trans support forum on the internet when I noticed a lot of people were using avatars from the new My Little Pony cartoon that had come out. I loved the art, I thought the ponies were adorable, and I thought it was really cool that My Little Pony was being claimed as a bit of an icon by the younger MtF community, in that for me it was such a powerful symbol for the joys of femininity, and like I said, symbolic of the things I had wished I could have had and wished I could have been but had to sacrifice, symbolic of the girlhood I missed out on. It was a nice morning.
But that day didn’t end up going very well.
At this point, I was terrified to death of coming out and what I was going to do about my roommates. I was in a rooming house, where each tenant was on an individual “lease” (actually just a xeroxed sheet of paper with several typos just saying party A agrees to give party B X dollars ever month).

Al Fowzan, a member of the 7-man supreme committee of scholars, said "he must be killed" if found guilty, Emirates 247
reported. The cleric also said there was no place for mercy, as he stated “Repenting will not work…any man who insults God or our Prophet should be killed.” Kashgari issued an apology when he realized the outrage his Tweets had caused.
Human Rights groups have spoken out against Malaysia's decision to return Kashgari to Saudi where he could face execution, accusing Malaysia of violating international human rights. However Malaysia was quick to defend its own position by comparing Kashgari to a terrorist. The BBC
reported Malaysian Home Minister Hishamuddin Hussein said "I will not allow Malaysia to be seen as a safe country for terrorists and those who are wanted by their countries of origin, and also be seen as a transit county.''

------------question-----------------------
What does the Mexican media suggest about the killings that have occurred since the marijuana was taken
------------correct----------------------
134 tons of marijuana that you took from us.”
Since then, the killings haven’t stopped. First came the slaughter of 13 young people at a party last Friday in Ciudad Juarez. Then came the up-against-the-wall execution of 13 drug addicts in Tijuana on Saturday. Third came yesterday’s mass execution of 15 people at a car wash in Nayarit state.
Then this morning’s newspapers say six people were executed in the Morelos district of the capital.
Are all these killings related? I don’t know. But the Mexican media is suggesting that all may be part of retaliation. It’s pretty grisly math: one ton equals one life.

Are all these killings related? I don’t know. But the Mexican media is suggesting that all may be part of retaliation. It’s pretty grisly math: one ton equals one life.

What cosmological phenomenon were NASA's Swift and High Energy Transient Explorer-2 satellites observing that is related to gamma-ray bursts
------------correct----------------------
From: University of Chicago
Posted: Wednesday, June 1, 2005
Observations of a cosmic explosion detected on Feb. 15 by two NASA satellites have thrown into doubt one popular explanation for such explosions and have also seriously weakened the argument for yet another, according to University of Chicago astrophysicist Don Lamb. But solving the mystery any time soon may be forestalled by plans to shut down one of the satellites in September.
The explosion in question is a powerful burst of X-rays called an X-ray flash that was observed by NASA's Swift and High Energy Transient Explorer-2 satellites. X-ray flashes seem to be related to gamma-ray bursts, the most powerful explosions in the universe. "No one understands this relationship at all. It's a complete mystery," said Lamb, the Louis Block Professor in Astronomy & Astrophysics at the University of Chicago and a member of the HETE-2 science team.
Lamb presents some ideas on the relationship of X-ray flashes to gamma-ray bursts during a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Minneapolis. The co-authors of his paper are Tim Donaghy, a Ph.D. student in physics, and Carlo Graziani, Senior Research Associate in Astronomy & Astrophysics, both at the University of Chicago.
Discovered in 1969, Gamma-ray bursts last anywhere from fractions of a second to many minutes and pack the output of as many as 1,000 exploding stars. They occur almost daily, come from any direction in the sky, and are followed by afterglows that are visible for a few days at X-ray and optical wavelengths.
Discovered in 2000, X-ray flashes seem to form the less powerful end of a continuum of cosmic explosions that progresses to X-ray rich gamma-ray bursts and then culminates in gamma-ray bursts proper. All three phenomena occur in approximately equal numbers.
"We think that regular gamma-ray bursts are all produced by the collapse of massive stars and probably the creation of black holes," Lamb said. "I personally think it's essentially a certainty that X-ray flashes are produced by the same kind of event."
But exactly how that occurs remains a matter of speculation. One possibility is that a varying rotation rate of the collapsed core of these massive stars produces different opening angles of the jets emitted from the bursts. "Maybe sometimes they're rotating rapidly and you get narrow jets and other times they're rotating less rapidly and you get wider X-ray rich jets and sometimes they're rotating still more slowly and you get very broad jets that prod

What gang is linked to the 134 tons of marijuana that were seized in Tijuana
------------correct----------------------
Maybe so. It could be that one ton of marijuana is worth one life.
That’s the bizarre calculus that one might arrive at after authorities made an unprecedented bust of 134 tons of marijuana in the border city of Tijuana early last week.
A back-of-the-envelope calculation says that amount of marijuana might have been worth north of $400 million on U.S. streets. Authorities later indicated it belonged to the Sinaloa Federation, the largest drug gang in Mexico.

Al Fowzan, a member of the 7-man supreme committee of scholars, said "he must be killed" if found guilty, Emirates 247
reported. The cleric also said there was no place for mercy, as he stated “Repenting will not work…any man who insults God or our Prophet should be killed.” Kashgari issued an apology when he realized the outrage his Tweets had caused.
Human Rights groups have spoken out against Malaysia's decision to return Kashgari to Saudi where he could face execution, accusing Malaysia of violating international human rights. However Malaysia was quick to defend its own position by comparing Kashgari to a terrorist. The BBC
reported Malaysian Home Minister Hishamuddin Hussein said "I will not allow Malaysia to be seen as a safe country for terrorists and those who are wanted by their countries of origin, and also be seen as a transit county.''

What reason did the Plaintiff provide for requesting a reconsideration of the Court's April 2, 2015 order
------------correct----------------------
n of an order, Local Rule 230(j) requires Plaintiff to show "what new or different facts or circumstances are claimed to exist which did not exist or were not shown upon such prior motion, or what other ground exist for the motion."
Plaintiff fails to demonstrate any basis to reconsider the Court's April 2, 2015, order. Plaintiff's claim that he was recently transferred from Coalinga State Hospital to the Fresno County jail while unfortunate is not a basis to reconsider the Court's April 2, 2015, order. Plaintiff is apparently without his legal property due his recent transfer and requests that the Court provide him with a copy of his original complaint. In light of the fact that Plaintiff was recently transferred from Coalinga State Hospital to the Fresno County jail and is without his legal property and Plaintiff's original complaint is not voluminous, the Court will make a one-time exception and provide Plaintiff with a free copy of his original complaint. However, Plaintiff is advised and cautioned that he is responsible for retaining any and all documentation related to this case. The Clerk of Court does not ordinarily provide free copies of case documents to parties. The Clerk charges $.50 per page for copies of documents. See 28 U.S.C. § 1914(a). Copies of up to twenty pages may be made by the Clerk's Office at this Court upon written request and prepayment of the copy fees. The fact that the Court has granted leave for Plaintiff to proceed in forma pauperis does not entitle him to free copies of documents from the Court. Under 28 U.S.C. § 2250, the Clerk is not required to furnish copies without cost to an indigent plaintiff except by order of the court.
Based on the foregoing, it is HEREBY ORDERED that:
1. Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the Court's April 2, 2015, order is DENIED; and
2. The Clerk of Court is directed to send Plaintiff a copy of the original complaint, filed May 12, 2014 (ECF No. 1) and copy of the Court's August 1, 2014, screening order (ECF No. 9).
IT IS SO ORDERED.

Saudi writer Hamza Kashgari
has been placed in a detention center in Riyadh, following his forcible return from Malaysia. The 23-year-old writer, who is deemed to have written blasphemous remarks on Twitter on the occasion of Prophet Mohammed's birthday, has been vilified in Saudi, where hard line religious clerics are baying for his blood by demanding his execution.
Now the Saudi Arabian authorities are even threatening those who would seek to speak out in support of Kashgari. According to Death Penalty News
the state prosecutor in Jeddah who is preparing to file a case against Kashgari "has also called for others who have replied in encouragement or agreement to Hamza Kashgari’s Twitter remarks to be prosecuted."

torcycle manufacturers, the fear has been that requiring anti-lock brakes and on board diagnostic equipment would drive up their costs, making the bikes more difficult to sell, especially during such periods of economic woes in Europe. Some current models intended for value may go extinct altogether.
Are all these fears warranted?
“The proposal for a new law still requires some improvements,” says Aline Delhaye, General Secretary of the Federation of European Motorcyclists’ Associations (FEMA).
“We consider the new delay of the voting on the draft as positive since it shows that MEPs are willing to listen once again to the compromises proposed by FEMA and by the motorcycle industry.”
IMCO members continue to cycle revisions to the law. No one can tell for sure what the final law will resemble, but Reynolds says motorcyclists shouldn’t have too much to fret over.
“It looks like the majority (of the IMCO) is in favor of deleting the bulk of the anti-tampering provisions. There will be a couple of points that will remain about defining powertrain, but basically, our point is that anti-tampering doesn’t really have a place in this draft law,” Reynolds says. “It’s more of a member state issue.”
That would certainly please the motorcycle community and groups working to lobby parliament against the law, or certain provisions within it. It has also been signaled that the provision requiring manufacturers to install costly on board diagnostic equipment would likely be scrapped as well.
As far as requiring headlights to remain on at all times, Malcom Harbour had previously indicated that the committee would be unlikely to budge. The issue of ABS may still be a cause of concern to motorcyclists. According to Reynolds, the committee remains in favor of requiring ABS for all full-sized motorcycles. The debate on the issue is centered on whether or not the law should also require scooters to come with ABS as a required feature.
“The consumer organizations and their associates want ABS on scooters because they are convinced it will bring them safety benefits, but it looks like that plays into the hands of Bosch,” Reynolds says. “In our view, the real safety benefit for scooters is combined braking system. Bosch disagrees.”
FEMA has revealed its willingness to compromise on certain issues. The group even supports some provisions of the law, such as the introduction of stricter emissions limits.
“We are aware that we will also lose some of our positions, especially our opposition to mandatory ABS,” Delhaye says. “But that does not mean that FEMA objects to the proposed new type approval regulation as a whole.”
On the other hand, some bikers and their supporters like Marta Andreasen see no room for compromise.
“I don’t believe the law will be watered down to the level that the lobbyists will still be happy,” she says. But regardless, her position is firm: “My position is to reject this law completely –There shouldn’t be any legislation.

n of an order, Local Rule 230(j) requires Plaintiff to show "what new or different facts or circumstances are claimed to exist which did not exist or were not shown upon such prior motion, or what other ground exist for the motion."
Plaintiff fails to demonstrate any basis to reconsider the Court's April 2, 2015, order. Plaintiff's claim that he was recently transferred from Coalinga State Hospital to the Fresno County jail while unfortunate is not a basis to reconsider the Court's April 2, 2015, order. Plaintiff is apparently without his legal property due his recent transfer and requests that the Court provide him with a copy of his original complaint. In light of the fact that Plaintiff was recently transferred from Coalinga State Hospital to the Fresno County jail and is without his legal property and Plaintiff's original complaint is not voluminous, the Court will make a one-time exception and provide Plaintiff with a free copy of his original complaint. However, Plaintiff is advised and cautioned that he is responsible for retaining any and all documentation related to this case. The Clerk of Court does not ordinarily provide free copies of case documents to parties. The Clerk charges $.50 per page for copies of documents. See 28 U.S.C. § 1914(a). Copies of up to twenty pages may be made by the Clerk's Office at this Court upon written request and prepayment of the copy fees. The fact that the Court has granted leave for Plaintiff to proceed in forma pauperis does not entitle him to free copies of documents from the Court.

O.G.P.U.’s BLOW TO TRADE

MOSCOW TRIAL ONE OF THE BIGGEST BLUNDERS IN HISTORY
Foreign Trade Wrecked by Fanatical Suspicion

The trial of the

blindly took when they ordered the arrest of the six Britons has had results
greatly damaging to the Soviet Union. The O.G.P.U. went about the frame-up

fear of the capitalist nations. According to the Bolsheviks, the

fanatical in another of its suspicions, namely, the relations between British
people and the Intelligence Service. The Bolsheviks really believe that

e strangers. I had no control over who I lived with. They were all men, all straight, and all rather macho. Most had drinking problems. There was only person who I’d yet told, and he’d reacted… interestingly (He was okay with it, but in a horribly patronizing and sexist way, and asked if he could feel my breasts. Seriously).
This roommate was named Chris. He was young and kind of hipster-ish in a really shallow way, made his living off of theft and scamming the Ministry Of Housing And Social Development, was one of the most manipulative people I’ve ever known, and drank a lot.
There was also an older roommate named James. James was a waiter at a fancy restaurant, had some pretty serious emotional issues, and also was a terrible alcoholic (as well as having a pretty huge weed habit, too). He was emphatically pro-life, extremely misogynistic, highly opinionated and domineering, and still very, very angry at an ex-girlfriend who’d aborted the child they’d conceived together twenty years ago.
I was a bit nervous about how the fuck I was going to come out to everyone and what their reactions would be, but my efforts to move out had failed miserably and I was broke. I was starting to look pretty feminine and was already experiencing male-fail (where someone in an MtF transition gets gendered female despite presenting as male). I intended to go full-time within a month or two, and just couldn’t keep it secret forever.
That afternoon, Chris invited over his pot dealer, Dave or something, to make a big sale to James. The two of them invited me out to the back porch to share a joint. I figured sure, what the heck, why not? I don’t smoke very often, but I accept it when offered. After smoking, Chris, who was sitting next to me, looked over at me and started discretely asking some trans-related questions. I indicated I wasn’t comfortable talking about any of that with James and Dave sitting right there. Chris indicated I should stop worrying and tell them. I said I wasn’t ready for that yet. Chris said he’d do it then. I told him not to. He said he was going to anyway. I begged him not to.
Chris looks over at James and Dave .“So I have this friend back in Calgary…”, he began. I was too terrified to be angry. “…and he’s like physically male but chemically female…” (my internal mental facepalm could have shamed the cosmos) “…and is going to get surgery to become a woman. What do you guys think of that?”
“Well I think that’s pretty fucked up” was Dave’s response, plainly stated. “People like that are mentally unbalanced and should be put in psychiatric hospitals.”
James just sat there looking visibly uncomfortable. “I don’t want to talk about this stuff. It creeps me out.”
I could feel my cheeks flushing with blood and heat. I knew there was absolutely no way I wasn’t going to tip myself off through body language alone, so I bolted, making up an excuse about munchies, and headed off for a quick walk.
When I got back, conversation halted, Chris wore a smirk, and Dave and James stared at me in bewilderment, morbid curiosity, fear and disgust. That was a look that, like my father’s, I would come to know pretty well. I knew within seconds what had happened. The moment after I left, Chris had revealed the identity of his “friend in Calgary”. He’d outed me.
I hid in my room for the duration of the afternoon, finally leaving in the evening when things were quiet and Dave had long since left to go grab some food from the 7/11 up the street. At the time, I was wearing a Henley t-shirt, a women’s (but unisex-enough) cropped leather jacket, girl jeans, and a pair of yellow Converse low-tops.
I grabbed a coke, a cup of frosted flakes and a Coffee Crisp and got in line. I stood in front of a really dodgy looking shaved-head white-urban-creep type dude in a really baggy camo jacket. After a few moments of standing there quietly, I heard him say, “Damn dude! Those are some UGLY fucking shoes!”
I just looked back, and gave a shrug and half-smile, not wanting to turn it into a confrontation.
A moment passed.
“I mean, really, those are like the UGLIEST fucking shoes I’ve ever seen! Where the fuck did you get shoes that ugly?!?”
I turned, smiled again, and asked “Do you make a lot of friends like this?”
“Not faggots. I don’t want any pussy faggots like you for friends.”
I turned away. I paid. I began walking home.
So this is how things were going to be from now on. I was openly hated. I was an acceptable target. A pussy faggot bitch. Mentally unbalanced and ought to be placed in a psychiatric hospital. Too weird and fucked up for people to talk about, because I’ll give them the creeps. The best I can hope for is that they might find me interesting enough to ask to feel my breasts instead of just staring in appalled silence. Cool. What an awesome life I was creating for myself. Yay. I wanted to just collapse into my bitterness and self-pity and wither away into a pile of dust and shame, then just blow away in the breeze.
And then I noticed something on the sidewalk. Just sitting there. A few feet outside my front door.
It was a My Little Pony. The kind they made back in the eighties when I was a kid. The kind I’d always wanted. And it was just sitting there on the sidewalk, waiting for me. Like a little message just for me.
A message that said no matter how many awful people there are in this world, or how much hate I was going to have deal with, this whole thing, transition, was still worth it. It was still completely the right choice. Because what it meant, far more than being a target for the scorn of a few idiots, was getting to finally be myself, finally stop suppressing and denying who I was, finally be able to do and be all the things I’d wanted, finally get to live honestly, sincerely, happily, finally not have to compromise myself for the expectations of others, finally get to give myself a life worth living, the life I’d wanted, the life I deserved. No more missed years. Finally be able to say so if I want a fucking pony.
I dusted her off, took her home and named her Serendipity.
And later I pulled open my laptop and began watching Friendship Is Magic. Which turned out to be every bit as awesome as I possibly could have hoped. As the weeks passed, I began proudly purchasing the new toys whenever I had a spare $6. That is how I fell in love with My Little Pony.
Yes, there’s all the cool, awesome, beautiful artwork and animation of Lauren Faust. And yes there’s some terrific, very positive messages in the show for girls. And yes it has some inspiring feminist elements, particularly the underlying message that there is more than one way to be a girl. And yes, the degree to which it’s been embraced and loved across demographics shows that we’ve arrived at a society much less constrained along its lines of gender than the eighties were, and makes me think about how much nicer things may now be for kids who want the “wrong” toys and like the “wrong” cartoons. That’s all true. And it makes the show terrific. But for me it’s also a lot more personal than that.
For me, it’s about one really bad day that ended on one really perfect note.

Motorcyclists plan a massive demonstration outside the EU Parliament in Brussels next week ahead of a committee vote on legislation designed to prevent them from modifying their bikes
By Marc Abizeid
Dear residents of Brussels: Lock up your daughters, hide your goods and stay off the streets Tuesday. Hundreds, maybe thousands, of riled up bikers from around Europe are gearing up for a massive motorcycle rally outside the European Parliament November 22 in opposition to proposed anti-tampering motorcycle legislation.
They’re message is clear: EU, get your hands off our bikes.
But still elusive is what the legislation will actually stipulate once it’s up for a vote on December 5 among members of the parliament’s Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee which has been tasked with reshaping the law. The vote was originally scheduled for November 22 (hence the biker protest) but was pushed back in order to have more time for review.
“It’s going to be up in the air until the committee vote, and even then that’s not the final stage,” says Stephane Reynolds, assistant to British MEP Malcom Harbour, chair of the IMCO. “But the picture becomes clear after the committee vote and before the parliament (plenary) vote.”
The original draft was met with fury by European motorcyclists when it was introduced last year. The main contentions among bikers included several key provisions that would apply to motorcycles manufactured after the date of the law’s implementation.
Those provisions would: prevent riders from modifying their bikes to increase power, torque or speed outside the standards set by the manufacturer or defined by the vehicle’s category; require bikes to come with anti-lock brake systems; require on board diagnostic equipment to warn of potential malfunctions, and; require bikes to come with automatic headlight-on. The main argument in favor of the law is to improve road safety and emissions control.
So, what’s the problem?
For many motorcyclists, their bikes represent their livelihoods. They see the legislation as an attempt by the EU to take away their hobby to modify bikes and restrict their freedoms on the road.
“Motorcycles are a big part of our culture in the UK,” says British MEP Marta Andreasen who has come out in firm opposition to the law. “This legislation has no value, it will just hurt our community.”
Andreasen has even drafted a petition that would force Parliament to debate the legislation should it collect 100,000 signatures, although the petition is still far from reaching that target.
There is also the question of how the law would affect small businesses that produce after market parts for specific models. If anti-tampering becomes a reality, those businesses would likely be limited to manufacturing parts for older models.
“I find this unfair,”Andreasen adds. “I suspect it’s the result of lobbying by big companies like Bosch (which produces ABS) which would profit from this legislation.”

What motivated the author to buy a sailboat at the age of 15
------------correct----------------------
When I was 15, I bought a sailboat. I had saved money all summer from working at a summer camp to be able afford it, and it seemed like the best use of the money.
Now, to clarify, this sailboat looks a lot more like a surfboard with a sail than the image that “sailboat” normally conjures. It’s small, suited for one, maybe two, people, and has clear signs of wear from the previous owner. But it’s mine, and I love it more than this post will do justice.
But alright, a 15-year-old with one summer’s earnings, why a sail boat?
Nothing is more incredible than tapping into natural energies to move. I know this sounds like a latent environmentalist message, but it’s not.
It’s just that when you harness the power of the wind, you totally feel like a Norse god.
When you go out in a kayak or canoe, you have to exert your own energy, when you go out in a motorboat, you have to exert some long-dead and fossilized animal or plant’s energy, but when you go out in a sailboat, you use nothing but the wind.
It’s absolutely exhilarating to sail

With absolutely no attempt at hyperbole at all, it is fair to say that this is one of - if not the - biggest achievement of the human race.
For, as we speak, an object conceived in the human mind, and built by our tools, and launched from our planet, is sailing out of the further depths of our solar system - and will be the first object made by man to sail out into interstellar s

What was the outcome of Gregory Ell Shehee's motion for reconsideration submitted to the court on April 10, 2015
------------correct----------------------
United States District Court, E.D. California
April 16, 2015
GREGORY ELL SHEHEE, Plaintiff,
K. TRUMBLY, et al., Defendants.
ORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION AND DIRECTING CLERK OF COURT TO SEND PLAINTIFF A COURTESY COPY OF ORIGINAL COMPLAINT AND COURT ORDER ISSUED AUGUST 1, 2014 [ECF No. 23]
STANLEY A. BOONE, Magistrate Judge.
Plaintiff Gregory Ell Shehee is a civil detainee proceeding pro se in a civil rights action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Individuals detained pursuant to California Welfare and Institutions Code § 6600 et seq. are civil detainees and are not prisoners within the meaning of the Prison Litigation Reform Act. Page v. Torrey, 201 F.3d 1136, 1140 (9th Cir. 2000).
On April 2, 2015, the Court vacated the pending order to show cause and granted Plaintiff thirty days to file an amended complaint.
On April 10, 2015, Plaintiff filed objections to the April 2, 2015, order which the Court construes as a motion for reconsideration. (ECF No. 23.)
Reconsideration motions are committed to the discretion of the trial court. Rodgers v. Watt, 711 F.2d 456, 460 (9th Cir. 1983); Combs v. Nick Garin Trucking, 825 F.2d 437, 441 (D.C. Cir. 1987). A party seeking reconsideration must set forth facts or law of a strongly convincing nature to induce the court to reverse a prior decision. See, e.g., Kern-Tulare Water Dist. v. City of Bakersfield, 634 F.Supp. 656, 665 (E.D. Cal. 1986), aff'd in part and rev'd in part on other grounds, 828 F.2d 514 (9th Cir. 1987).
Rule 60(b)(6) allows the Court to relieve a party from an order for any reason that justifies relief. Rule 60(b)(6) "is to be used sparingly as an equitable remedy to prevent manifest injustice and is to be utilized only where extraordinary circumstances..." exist. Harvest v. Castro, 531 F.3d 737, 749 (9th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The moving party "must demonstrate boy injury and circumstances beyond his control...." Id .

What type of memories does the narrator associate with the Laura Ashley fabric
------------correct----------------------
find. I bet their creators never imagined that these pieces would be turned into clothing or used as textile art.
|Crochet trim, Button, Beads|
It's all about the history of these items and how slowly they have moved through time to become something completely different then initially intended. Not only time but places. I have some Laura Ashley fabric from the early 80s that was purchased for me by someone who was traveling through England and knew I would love this fabric. I still haven't cut it. When I see and touch that fabric I think about the person who bought it for me. How can I cut something like that? Perhaps I'll make a quilt with this fabric so that I can see it and touch it to evoke the memories of another time. If I make that quilt, or if I leave that fabric untouched as that fabric passes through time no one will ever know the emotional value of that piece of fabric.
|Barkcloth and Button|
However, as time marches on all of these materials wind their way to other places and time to become creations made by new hands. They are sometimes used alone or combined with other "finds." So the coming together of all of these pieces is definitely "slow creating."

- 13 Men Wellness Is Another Low Competition Niche
- 14 Conclusion
So most people who are looking to start a blog, get discouraged because they say the market is just too saturated and they think that they will not be able to penetrate the market and make money with their blog. In this article, we take a look at low competition niches in 2020. But is there such a thing as a low competition niches?
The thing is no matter what you think of, there are people who have thought of that idea before you and they have probably built a website on it. Take woodwork, for example, this was one of the less competitive niches a few years ago, but now there are so many woodwork blogs and YouTube channels.
Should that stop you from starting a woodwork blog? Definitely not. What some people miss understanding is that your way of presenting things is not the same as the other person’s, for example, I am running a make money online website here.
How Many Make Money Websites Are Out There?
There are so many make money online websites and YouTube channels, did that stop me from starting this website? Nope, even though I knew it’s not gonna be easy, I still went for it because I had tips to share and I had a passion.
Sure, my website is not as fancy or as big as that one of Neal Patel but hey I have my own little platform here and I can share whatever I feel like sharing.
All that being said, there are some less competitive blog niches, that you can venture into and earn an income.
Let’s Take A Look At These Low Competition Blog Niches
Security System Reviews
Although there are websites that are reviewing security systems, this niche is not as competitive as let’s say the make money online, or fitness/weight loss.
Within this niche, there are many products that you can promote, and you can even find lots of products on Amazon, which makes sales easier.
Gaming, Are people Making Fun of You For Playing Video Games?
If you have read my about how Children became the highest earners on YouTube, then you know that the gaming community was among the top ten YouTube earners, earning millions of dollars, this is a huge niche and it’s still not taken seriously.
So if you like internet games, then you can create your own blog, and even a YouTube channel and get a piece of this huge pie.
OK, when I say dancing, I am not talking about any kind of dancing, I am referring to pole dancing, this is a niche that is almost untouched. If you create a nice blog where you share all kinds of tips and product reviews, you will be able to earn a good income from this niche.
You will be able to find a bunch of products to promote in this niche from sites like ClickBank, ShareASale and even amazon, you can promote shoes, outfits, makeup and lots of other things that involve this kind of dancing, just try to make your articles as clean and professional as possible.
You can also do reviews of training centers and ask them for a coupon code and an affiliate link, so you can earn a commission when someone signs up as a result of reading your review.
Green Energy, Help Our Planet And Earn At The Same Time
OK, so we all know that our planet needs some TLC or we are all gonna perish. This niche is one that could be very lucrative, and you will also help our planet by running such a site and recommending products like solar-powered lamps, solar panels, etc
And while we are in the subject of environment and planet, let’s talk Eco-friendly products, this is another niche that you could actually incorporate into your Renewable energy site as a category and grow your website that way.
Or you can choose it as a niche on its own.
CBD For Pets
The world has gone CBD crazy and even though there are many CBD websites, the CBD for pets niche it’s still less competitive and if you are into the whole CBD thing, then you can create a very successful website in this niche.
Most people these days are going for LED lights, so your job as a blogger will be to create a website where people can learn about the best-LED lights, lamps, etc
So I bet you are wondering how you can build a military niche website/blog, believe it or not, this is a niche that can bring you some really good income.

- 14 Conclusion
So most people who are looking to start a blog, get discouraged because they say the market is just too saturated and they think that they will not be able to penetrate the market and make money with their blog. In this article, we take a look at low competition niches in 2020. But is there such a thing as a low competition niches?
The thing is no matter what you think of, there are people who have thought of that idea before you and they have probably built a website on it. Take woodwork, for example, this was one of the less competitive niches a few years ago, but now there are so many woodwork blogs and YouTube channels.
Should that stop you from starting a woodwork blog? Definitely not. What some people miss understanding is that your way of presenting things is not the same as the other person’s, for example, I am running a make money online website here.
How Many Make Money Websites Are Out There?
There are so many make money online websites and YouTube channels, did that stop me from starting this website? Nope, even though I knew it’s not gonna be easy, I still went for it because I had tips to share and I had a passion.
Sure, my website is not as fancy or as big as that one of Neal Patel but hey I have my own little platform here and I can share whatever I feel like sharing.
All that being said, there are some less competitive blog niches, that you can venture into and earn an income.
Let’s Take A Look At These Low Competition Blog Niches
Security System Reviews
Although there are websites that are reviewing security systems, this niche is not as competitive as let’s say the make money online, or fitness/weight loss.
Within this niche, there are many products that you can promote, and you can even find lots of products on Amazon, which makes sales easier.
Gaming, Are people Making Fun of You For Playing Video Games?
If you have read my about how Children became the highest earners on YouTube, then you know that the gaming community was among the top ten YouTube earners, earning millions of dollars, this is a huge niche and it’s still not taken seriously.
So if you like internet games, then you can create your own blog, and even a YouTube channel and get a piece of this huge pie.
OK, when I say dancing, I am not talking about any kind of dancing, I am referring to pole dancing, this is a niche that is almost untouched. If you create a nice blog where you share all kinds of tips and product reviews, you will be able to earn a good income from this niche.
You will be able to find a bunch of products to promote in this niche from sites like ClickBank, ShareASale and even amazon, you can promote shoes, outfits, makeup and lots of other things that involve this kind of dancing, just try to make your articles as clean and professional as possible.
You can also do reviews of training centers and ask them for a coupon code and an affiliate link, so you can earn a commission when someone signs up as a result of reading your review.
Green Energy, Help Our Planet And Earn At The Same Time
OK, so we all know that our planet needs some TLC or we are all gonna perish. This niche is one that could be very lucrative, and you will also help our planet by running such a site and recommending products like solar-powered lamps, solar panels, etc
And while we are in the subject of environment and planet, let’s talk Eco-friendly products, this is another niche that you could actually incorporate into your Renewable energy site as a category and grow your website that way.
Or you can choose it as a niche on its own.
CBD For Pets
The world has gone CBD crazy and even though there are many CBD websites, the CBD for pets niche it’s still less competitive and if you are into the whole CBD thing, then you can create a very successful website in this niche.
Most people these days are going for LED lights, so your job as a blogger will be to create a website where people can learn about the best-LED lights, lamps, etc
So I bet you are wondering how you can build a military niche website/blog, believe it or not, this is a niche that can bring you some really good income.
If you have a military background, you can start a blog, where you share content that caters to military families, you can cover topics like life in the military, the transition process from military to civilian, etc
We are living in times when people have somehow become very spiritual, not necessarily religious, but spiritual, we have people who believe in the rule of attraction, that is the thing on YouTube and Pinterest, it’s all about manifestation, and attracting the things you want in your life.

uce the X-ray flashes," Lamb explained.
The Feb. 15 X-ray flash, designated XRF 050215b, has yielded the best data ever on this phenomenon, thanks to the joint observations of the two NASA satellites. The next-best data come from a flash known as XRF 020427, detected in April 2002 by the Italian BeppoSAX satellite. Three characteristics of both flashes conflict with a popular theory that X-ray flashes are gamma-ray bursts as viewed from slightly off to the side of the jet instead of head on.
First, according to the popular theory, scientists expected the energy levels of an X-ray flash's afterglow to connect smoothly on a gradient with the energy of the burst itself. Second, they expected the afterglow to fade fast. And third, they expected the afterglow to be faint when compared to the original burst.
These expectations all follow from Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity, but none of them have panned out. Scientists apparently cannot rely on special relativity to explain X-ray flashes, Lamb said.
The satellite observations also conflict with the theory that the shape of the jets from a gamma-ray burst are universal, but only look different because of the viewing angle. Based on this theory, scientists would have predicted that the afterglow of the Feb. 15 X-ray flash afterglow would have faded within a day or so following the initial burst. But the afterglow showed now signs of fading even five days following the burst.
One theory suggests that all three types of explosions contain the same amount of energy, but that the opening angle of the jet emitted from the explosions defines their apparent brightness.
In this scenario, narrow jets produce the gamma-ray bursts, wider jets result in X-ray rich gamma-ray bursts, and the broadest lead to X-ray flashes. Lamb and many others view this theory as a possibility. "There's a lot of people who don't or are not at all sure," he said.
The question could probably be settled within the next few years with more burst observations conducted jointly between the Swift and HETE-2 satellites, which measure slightly different properties of the phenomena. But NASA plans to discontinue the HETE-2 mission this September.
NASA would somehow need to find an additional $1.5 million annually to keep HETE-2 operating. "It's not the best budgetary climate to try to pull this thing off," Lamb said. But if NASA somehow manages to do it, "The HETE mission would leverage the science that Swift could do by a significant amount," he said.

What does the large humanoid ask for in his cell
------------correct----------------------
his tattoos but other than a slight spark, they produce no noticable
The next cell is occupied by a very large humanoid, at least nine feet
tall; handsome with a kindly face who looks upon the company. "I have
been imprisoned wrongly." he says. "Please let me go free and your
reward will be rich."
The third cell is occupied by a tall man who, even in his loincloth,
appears to be of noble bearing. His eyes are piercing and cold, and if
he is interested in the company at all, he does not betray it.
The company is lead to the sixth cell, which is large enough for Ted
and his companions. Two guards remain inside the cell, and the rest
post themselves close by.

Alex can only sense fear and confusion, nothing surprising
considering. Still her dagger tries to pierce deeper, but it as if the
door is shut and the deeper thoughts cannot be sensed.
> "Justin... Justin...," the lizard man gasps. "Make them stop."
Justin looks disquieted and distrustful. His two dogs flank Ted,
awaiting only his command to pounce.
"We're trying to help you." he says. "Can you tell us what happened.
Why did you try to kill the king?"
A moment or two later the King and Sir Prrcyvel appear. "Well, let us
see what you can do." the King says. "Mrrlyn has been alrerted, though
why he is not here now I find a little disturbing."
They also notice for the first time that Louissa is not among them.
She had gone with Ted when he had been first taken into custody but
she is nowhere to be seen.

to even get heard in music. like alot of DJ’s MC’s use to ignore me but i didn’t get effected by it.. it just made
me wanna work harder. now those same DJ’s and MC’s need me hahahahaha. but that just shows if you belive in yourself
you can do anyting you want. trust me
What are your views on up and coming producers if you like them will you take them under your wing or will just let them do their thing ?
There’s alot of new producers coming through which is very good to see. we need more producers with different styles.
i cant take anyone under my wing because i still have alot of work to do myself.
but i will defo advice any one who asks for it. im easy to talk to.
Mr.FREAK from Dubfreaks told me that your using a lot more ‘dubstep’ sounds. Whats your take on the whole dubstep scene at the moment and would you say your involved in it ?
The dubstep scene is crazy, i love the energy but dubstep and grime are the same to me not much difference to me.
Also who is the best mc at a rave ?
Right now Pmoney, Skepta, and Tempa T thats who i think
What are your goals that you want to achieve that you haven’t achieved yet ?
Theres so many goals i want to achieve i will be here all day saying them haha.. i will say a few though,
i wanna do a vocal album, do another instrumental video, work alot with singers, and just bring my style
into the mainstream music world.
Thanks again is there anything else you want to say ?

I JUST now had to stop myself from eating the ENTIRE bar!!!....this is an OUTSTANDING bar...SOOOO delicious!!!
Posted by 5473521142308292380 on Mar 12, 2016
I love almonds AND dark chocolate. This bar is a winner for so many reasons. Organic, not too sweet, lots of big pieces of almonds, smooth chocolate texture and a great price, here at IHerbs. What's not to love! I hope I can buy this product somewhere locally, during the summer as I note that they can't be shipped during that time due to summer heat. Geral

What was highlighted as the best dessert at the Governors Ball and why
------------correct----------------------
pened to be the stage that Grizzly Bear played. As usual, the band was absolutely incredible, but what was most entertaining about the set was the crowd filled with hip hop fanatics who couldn’t help but get into “Two Weeks”. Heads were bobbing everywhere.
Get a new sound guy: Sorry Beirut, but your set was all but lost at Governors Ball. Your delightful folk pop was way too bass-y, making the lyrics incoherent. For anyone who was seeing Beirut for the first time, try and see them again, they really can be incredible.
Best quote: Towards the end of a rain-soaked Friday, we were making our way to the refuge of the SKYY Vodka tent for whoever the hell was playing. We were excited for Eryka Badu, but it really didn’t matter who was playing, we just wanted to get out of the monsoon. And this is the exact moment our friend uttered the quote of the festival, “everyone would be under that tent even if Limp Bizkit were playing.” So true, Daniel Topete.
Best dessert: This one’s a no-brainer! Brooklyn’s Arancini Bros had a stand set up and had a ton of savory fried rice balls for sale. But it was their nutella-filled, cinnamon and sugar coated ball that won our hearts. It was seriously one of the best treats I’ve had my entire life. A close runner up was the free samples from Ben & Jerry’s.
Best set: Though there were countless amazing sets at Governors Ball, it was Haim (officially pronounced Hi-um) that stole the show. These chicks are unstoppable and captivated the massive crowd that was out in full-force to see them on the main stage. You need to see them as soon as you possibly can.
Best set (other than Haim): Having seen Twin Shadow over a year ago and simply enjoying his set, I wasn’t as excited as I should have been for his Governors Ball appearance. Since releasing his 2012 album, Confess, his set has been injected with tons of guitar, which take the place of dreamy synths that I personally thought were overkill. This set blew me away and sold me on Brooklyn based artist who’ll likely play the main stage whenever he releases his next record.
Worst muddy repercussions: This award should be going to the grass fields on Randall’s Island, or rather the muddy hell that replaced them after a day and night of torrential rain, if it were not for the Chinese bagel place in Manhattan that sits right where the bridge from Randall’s Island left the thousands of festival-goers. While they knew what they were in for, I doubt they expected to be left with a barely-recognizable bathroom and muddy brown floors. Sorry guys!
Should have been a surprise headliner: I mean, Puddle of Mudd would have made a lot of sense!
Rest in peace: The thousands and thousands of umbrellas and Sperrys lost in the mud (including mine).
Surprisingly top 40 crowd: Yeah, we all know Alt-J is incredible. But I really wasn’t expecting the bro-filled crowd that flocked to the Honda Stage on Saturday for them. It was a stunning sight to witness

United States District Court, E.D. California
April 16, 2015
GREGORY ELL SHEHEE, Plaintiff,
K. TRUMBLY, et al., Defendants.
ORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION AND DIRECTING CLERK OF COURT TO SEND PLAINTIFF A COURTESY COPY OF ORIGINAL COMPLAINT AND COURT ORDER ISSUED AUGUST 1, 2014 [ECF No. 23]
STANLEY A. BOONE, Magistrate Judge.
Plaintiff Gregory Ell Shehee is a civil detainee proceeding pro se in a civil rights action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Individuals detained pursuant to California Welfare and Institutions Code § 6600 et seq. are civil detainees and are not prisoners within the meaning of the Prison Litigation Reform Act. Page v. Torrey, 201 F.3d 1136, 1140 (9th Cir. 2000).
On April 2, 2015, the Court vacated the pending order to show cause and granted Plaintiff thirty days to file an amended complaint.
On April 10, 2015, Plaintiff filed objections to the April 2, 2015, order which the Court construes as a motion for reconsideration. (ECF No. 23.)
Reconsideration motions are committed to the discretion of the trial court. Rodgers v. Watt, 711 F.2d 456, 460 (9th Cir. 1983); Combs v. Nick Garin Trucking, 825 F.2d 437, 441 (D.C. Cir. 1987). A party seeking reconsideration must set forth facts or law of a strongly convincing nature to induce the court to reverse a prior decision. See, e.g., Kern-Tulare Water Dist. v. City of Bakersfield, 634 F.Supp. 656, 665 (E.D. Cal. 1986), aff'd in part and rev'd in part on other grounds, 828 F.2d 514 (9th Cir. 1987).
Rule 60(b)(6) allows the Court to relieve a party from an order for any reason that justifies relief. Rule 60(b)(6) "is to be used sparingly as an equitable remedy to prevent manifest injustice and is to be utilized only where extraordinary circumstances..." exist. Harvest v. Castro, 531 F.3d 737, 749 (9th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The moving party "must demonstrate boy injury and circumstances beyond his control...." Id .

- 14 Conclusion
So most people who are looking to start a blog, get discouraged because they say the market is just too saturated and they think that they will not be able to penetrate the market and make money with their blog. In this article, we take a look at low competition niches in 2020. But is there such a thing as a low competition niches?
The thing is no matter what you think of, there are people who have thought of that idea before you and they have probably built a website on it. Take woodwork, for example, this was one of the less competitive niches a few years ago, but now there are so many woodwork blogs and YouTube channels.
Should that stop you from starting a woodwork blog? Definitely not. What some people miss understanding is that your way of presenting things is not the same as the other person’s, for example, I am running a make money online website here.
How Many Make Money Websites Are Out There?
There are so many make money online websites and YouTube channels, did that stop me from starting this website? Nope, even though I knew it’s not gonna be easy, I still went for it because I had tips to share and I had a passion.
Sure, my website is not as fancy or as big as that one of Neal Patel but hey I have my own little platform here and I can share whatever I feel like sharing.
All that being said, there are some less competitive blog niches, that you can venture into and earn an income.
Let’s Take A Look At These Low Competition Blog Niches
Security System Reviews
Although there are websites that are reviewing security systems, this niche is not as competitive as let’s say the make money online, or fitness/weight loss.
Within this niche, there are many products that you can promote, and you can even find lots of products on Amazon, which makes sales easier.
Gaming, Are people Making Fun of You For Playing Video Games?
If you have read my about how Children became the highest earners on YouTube, then you know that the gaming community was among the top ten YouTube earners, earning millions of dollars, this is a huge niche and it’s still not taken seriously.
So if you like internet games, then you can create your own blog, and even a YouTube channel and get a piece of this huge pie.
OK, when I say dancing, I am not talking about any kind of dancing, I am referring to pole dancing, this is a niche that is almost untouched. If you create a nice blog where you share all kinds of tips and product reviews, you will be able to earn a good income from this niche.
You will be able to find a bunch of products to promote in this niche from sites like ClickBank, ShareASale and even amazon, you can promote shoes, outfits, makeup and lots of other things that involve this kind of dancing, just try to make your articles as clean and professional as possible.
You can also do reviews of training centers and ask them for a coupon code and an affiliate link, so you can earn a commission when someone signs up as a result of reading your review.
Green Energy, Help Our Planet And Earn At The Same Time
OK, so we all know that our planet needs some TLC or we are all gonna perish. This niche is one that could be very lucrative, and you will also help our planet by running such a site and recommending products like solar-powered lamps, solar panels, etc
And while we are in the subject of environment and planet, let’s talk Eco-friendly products, this is another niche that you could actually incorporate into your Renewable energy site as a category and grow your website that way.
Or you can choose it as a niche on its own.
CBD For Pets
The world has gone CBD crazy and even though there are many CBD websites, the CBD for pets niche it’s still less competitive and if you are into the whole CBD thing, then you can create a very successful website in this niche.
Most people these days are going for LED lights, so your job as a blogger will be to create a website where people can learn about the best-LED lights, lamps, etc
So I bet you are wondering how you can build a military niche website/blog, believe it or not, this is a niche that can bring you some really good income.
If you have a military background, you can start a blog, where you share content that caters to military families, you can cover topics like life in the military, the transition process from military to civilian, etc
We are living in times when people have somehow become very spiritual, not necessarily religious, but spiritual, we have people who believe in the rule of attraction, that is the thing on YouTube and Pinterest, it’s all about manifestation, and attracting the things you want in your life.
I still don’t know how that whole power of attraction and manifestation works, I was recently watching a lady on YouTube who claimed to have manifested $100,000, I would love to learn to d
