------------answer-----------------------
John Kerry - Superhero:
In the vicious end of days in this campaign, so much gets lost in the caterwauling of the media. Here's something that's happened in the last couple of days: John Kerry has found the last piece of the puzzle, the final cause to push to the end of the battle. If you've listened to Kerry since the dual revelations of the missing 760,000 pounds of high-powered explosives from a known ammo dump and the coming request for an additional $70 billion dollars for Iraq and Afghanistan, Kerry has become the man we've all heard about - the unstoppable crusader for what's right against however powerful the forces of evil may be. Kerry has been tough-guy posturing for most of the campaign, and it's been a ludicrous sight. How many animals must be hunted and killed in order for a Democrat to look strong on defense? As Bradley Whitford said on Bill Maher's show last week, "How many times does a guy have to be shot in the ass running across rice paddies in Vietnam in order to look tougher than the cheerleader from Andover?"
Here's the deal - what's been missing from the entire Kerry campaign is just how tough a motherfucker John Kerry really, actually is, and it's got jackshit to do with hunting geese and killing the Vietcong. Kerry is a superhero, the kind of valiant son of a bitch who doesn't give a rat's ass about his own life in order to make the lives of others better. It's his post-Vietnam life that makes him a superhero. You don't know how much a superhero the man in the cape is by his origins. You know a superhero by his deeds. And if Kerry loses, it'll be because his campaign refused to acknowledge just how kick-ass Kerry has been since his final purple heart (and if Kerry loses, adviser Bob Shrum, who, in essence, said the public was too stupid to understand Kerry's accomplishments, should be strung up by his balls and batted around like a pinata by the Democratic party leadership until he bursts open and showers everyone with his innards).
Yeah, yeah, this is gonna be a down-on-the-knees-Kerry-supportin-hummer of an entry, but the Rude Pundit keeps talking to people who sigh and say, "I guess I'm gonna vote for Bush" because they can't bring themselves to vote for Kerry. They see him as weak. They see him as a flip-flopper. In other words, they see him as the projection of self that Bush has imposed on Kerry. In other words, these voters are too blinded by the glow that emits from the crown on Bush's head to believe that they own the democracy.
Kerry vs. Nixon: When Kerry helped organize the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, he was directly confronting a hegemonic ideology in the country that said the people must blindly follow their leaders. Kerry, villified at the time with incredible viciousness, did not back down from charges of treason and heresy. Check out the end of the book The New Soldier, which Kerry co-wrote and edited in order to talk about what the young men returning from Vietnam had confronted in the name of "freedom" from Communism. The book is, ironically enough, mostly reprinted on an anti-Kerry site. Kerry writes, "We are asking America to turn from false glory, hollow victory, fabricated foreign threats, fear which

What does the author reflect on during Silent Saturday in relation to silence and listening
------------correct----------------------
go, complaining to You that the human brain was too thin to deal with my powerful reptilian brain. Sigh. I do have upwellings of my deeper selves. But, they have ENERGY and STRENGTH in them! They are MY RESPONSIBILITY to manage . . . to love and care for. Double sigh!
So, today, Silent Saturday, — that profound gap between the Death of Jesus and the Resurrection of Jesus — seems like a very good time to resume our conversation. I think it was Father Keating who said, “Silence is God’s first language. All else is a poor translation.”
Ah, help me to be silent, too. And to listen with my heart.

Anthropology brings a global perspective to the study of human diversity by means of in-depth research at the local level and comparative studies that explore human experience through time and across space.
At Syracuse University our program is organized around Archaeology and Cultural Anthropology; however, we embrace a holistic approach to anthropology through teaching in research in archaeological, biological, cultural, and linguistic.

ID 2.0 is actually a giant step forward," Mundie said.
By integrating these two technologies, Microsoft expects to "eliminate the issue of the man-in-the-middle-attack," Mundie said. In these attacks, which are increasingly being used by phishers, a thief steals sensitive information by setting up a fake Web site that passes information back and forth between the victim and the legitimate Web site. OpenID is an emerging open-source standard that simplifies the task of logging on to many different Web sites.

What effects does clonidine have on migraines according to the review by JuliusSnoozer
------------correct----------------------
6 PM|
|Review by JuliusSnoozer:||User Rating:|
Catapres (clonidine): Clonidine will prevent a migraine for me, if I take it as soon as the headache is starting, and sometimes even helps after it's under way. Of course, the drug does cause wooziness, so I have to be careful about standing up or making other sudden moves. It's very effective, and cheap. Give it a 10.

------------question-----------------------
What top notes were used in the perfume that was made during the course
------------correct----------------------
I recently attended a perfume making vocational course this month. It was interesting, more of a hands on experience than anything else. The lecturer was well informed and knew a lot about soapmaking and perfumery. There was a bit of confusion with the formulas we were given though since grams and mL were used interchangeably during the discussions. For home makers its not such a big issue since we don’t need to meet regulatory standards.
I made a batch of perfume yesterday. A truly lovely floral blend that lasted more than four hours on my skin. With Tangerine as a top note, it’s an uplifting and cheerful scent. The soft and water floral middle notes make it a light and sweet. I didn’t get a nose full of it at its base note phase, but the other notes make it very light. I took a photo with my smartphone, but it was pretty bad. so no photo for now.
- Top Notes: Tangerine, Sap, Reseda Plant
- Middle Notes: Wild Rose, Red Cyclamen, Peach Blossom, Blue Hyacinth, Iris, Nectar
- Base Note

What should you do if you can't access the RICS website while it is confirmed to be up
------------correct----------------------
RICS current status check is already running (23.10.2020).
If RICS is UP but you can’t access the page, try one of the below solutions:
Browser’s cache. Most popular browsers use page caching to save frequently requested resources on the user’s computer, thus reducing bandwidth consumption and speeding up the browser. To obtain the latest version of the page, ignoring the cache, use the combination Ctrl + F5.
Access to site was denied. If you connect to the Internet via dynamic IP addresses, it’s possible that access to the site for your current IP address was previously blocked. Clear cookies and change your IP address.
Antivirus and firewall. Make sure that the antivirus software or firewall, you may have running on your computer, doesn’t block access to rics.org.
DNS cache. DNS cache contains records of all the recent visits and attempted visits to sites and other Internet domains. For example, if the site has changed its IP address, you will not be able to access it. Clear the DNS cache on your computer and try again.
Alternative DNS services. DNS (Domain Name System) converts domain names to IP addresses. Try using an alternative DNS service, other than your ISP’s, for example, OpenDNS or Google Public DNS.

Alex Ovechkin, Alexander Semin, and Nicklas Backstrom all finding the score sheet. Ovechkin is having a solid season, but his goal numbers are down compared to previous seasons. The lingering feeling that Ovechkin has a goal eruption coming hangs over the team and once it happens (if it happens) the high-scoring Caps we got accustomed to seeing will be back in a big way.
That’s not to say this game isn’t big for the Penguins. The Pens are getting Jordan Staal back in their lineup tonight and that means for the first time this year, the Pens have their full compliment of great players back on the ice. We’ll get a look at how Staal looks with Evgeni Malkin on his wing and if that’s the thing the Penguins needed to take control of the Eastern Conference races.
As it is, the Pens are four points up on both Washington and Tampa Bay for the overall lead in the East. The Pens getting another win, ideally a regulation win with just two points for them and none for the Caps, would work two-fold. The Pens would extend their lead and they’d also deliver a psychological blow to Washington, something that could linger with them all year long.
Overall though, this game is a must-win for Washington. If it turns into another game where they fall behind early and try to gut it out, it creates unnecessary drama for them. After all, moral victories aren’t counted in the standings and when it comes to Pittsburgh, racking up those kinds of wins doesn’t do anything to help them out in the long run and for Washington, that’s what matters the most.

threatens us as a nation, shallow pride which feeds off fear, and mostly from the promises which have proven so deceiving these past ten years." Change "ten" to "four," and you get the idea. The rest of the essay is stunningly humble, and it is simply a call to be citizens with eyes and ears open, to allow that maybe the powerful are more concerned with keeping power than with admitting error. And it is horribly, frighteningly prescient. What people forget about Kerry's protest days is that he was defending the lives of soldiers and that he was right.
Kerry vs. Reagan: When Kerry faced down the Reagan administration in his dogged pursuit of the Contra-drug connection, he was a freshman Senator taking on one of the most popular Presidents in American history. Instead of backing down from repeated threats to his political career, Kerry had his staff stay on the case like a viper injecting venom into your leg. They would have had to cut off his head in order to get him to stop, and he stayed on it until he revealed that the Reagan administration allowed the Contras to smuggle cocaine into the U.S. in order to fund their CIA-led "war" against the legally-elected Sandinistas in Nicaragua. (And thus helping to cause the crack epidemic.) Kerry was called a conspiracy theorist, said to be interfering with other drug cases, and impugned throughout the media. But the part that rarely got told is that he was right.
Kerry vs. Bush I: When Kerry went after the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, which was involved in laundering the Contra drug money, funneling money from the U.S. to Saddam Hussein (when he was our beloved dictator), and supporting illegal arms trade with terrorists and drug lords (including Afghanistan), it was his first chance to take on the Bush dynasty. When Bush I was in power, the administration and the CIA overlooked the crimes of BCCI, possibly because the bank was intimately involved in the financial dealings of the Bush family. Kerry had already kicked ass on the savings and loan scandals of the 1980s, so why not fuck with George H.W. Bush if 41 was fucking over the good of the country and the world? He brought down BCCI, and he cut off a vital funding source for terrorists. Again, Kerry was bucking the will of Democrats in Congress, as well as a Republican administration, in order to do what he knew was right.
Listen closely and tell anyone you know who is still thinking about voting for Bush: has Bush ever, personally, faced down anyone other than with a chant of "Drink, drink, drink"? Has he ever gone against someone who was really, truly powerful in order to place the good of the people above his own good? No. Heroes do that - they don't care what's in their way - they will face down evil, no matter how powerful. And they don't bother with those who are too weak to fight. It's why the latest news from Iraq fanned the fire: those in charge have screwed us over again, and Kerry's ready to bring the superhero costume out. Call him "the Winter Soldier."
Kerry's done a fuck of a lot more than pull a guy out of a river. And the fact that America doesn't know that says a great deal about how we negotiate our desolate political landscape

Why does Washington need to win the game against Pittsburgh in the Winter Classic
------------correct----------------------
With tonight’s Winter Classic dropping the puck at 8 p.m. we see two teams that are indeed rivals that are sitting at the top of the Eastern Conference. Don’t let their place in the standings fool you though, there are stark differences between the two and how they’re playing leading into tonight’s game.
Washington has put their eight-game losing streak behind them and they’ve won four of their last five games but that one loss in the middle of that is to Pittsburgh. With the teams only meeting four times this season, each game brings a special kind of heat to it and with tonight’s game being the Winter Classic, the pressure is intense to win each game to prove a point.
But who needs to win this game more? For us, the answer is obvious. Washington needs to get a win tonight and if you’ve seen any part of HBO’s 24/7 you know why. The Capitals need a confidence boost.
The Caps’ recent success is good for them because it keeps them from being the quiet and sullen team they appeared to be on 24/7. That said, getting wins over Ottawa, New Jersey, and Carolina aren’t really awe-inspiring. Their 3-0 shutout win over Montreal was a solid psychological boost after their failure against Montreal last year. A win against the Penguins in Pittsburgh today in front of 65,000 fans is the exact kind of win this temperamental Caps team needs to stay focused and to completely put that miserable losing streak in the past for good.
What would be best for Washington would be to beat Pittsburgh and beat them handily with their offensive stars like

Microsoft Corp. has thrown its weight behind OpenID, an emerging Web authentication standard. The announcement was made Tuesday at the RSA Conference in San Francisco during a joint keynote by Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates and Chief Research and Strategy Officer Craig Mundie that was long on vision and short on specifics.

------------question-----------------------
How is John Kerry's public speaking ability compared to that of Bill Clinton in the context of his convention speech
------------correct----------------------
In the words of one Democrat after John Kerry's long-awaited speech to his party's convention: "He was good, but he's no Clinton." When it comes to public speaking, what does it take to hold a crowd?He may be an experienced and highly adept politician, but even John Kerry's supporters acknowledge their man has a notable weakness: his public persona.
With his speech to the Democratic Party's convention on Thursday Mr Kerry turned in a better performance than many had expected.
But unlike Bill Clinton, or even his running mate, John Edwards, Mr Kerry is judged not to be a natural public speaker.
Of course it's not only politicians who wrestle with this tag. A new guide in the UK exposes some of the heart-stopping clangers that have cropped up in wedding speeches. In one case a groom got his bride's name wrong while another made a business-like presentation complete with overhead projector.
But all is not lost. Here, Max Atkinson, who once trained a public speaking novice to address a political party conference - and saw his pupil receive a standing ovation - delivers the key messages.
LISTS OF THREE
Bad speeches can be disastrous for weddings
Good speeches are memorable ones, and to that end the more rhetoric, the better. A key device in lodging phrases in the minds of an audience is the "list of three", which dates back to Classical times - "veni, vidi, vici (I came, I saw, I conquered)". Then there was "the father, the son and the holy spirit". Later came "liberté, égalité, fraternité" followed by Abraham Lincoln's "government of the people, by the people, for the people".
More latterly, there was former Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell's "fight, fight and fight again [for the party]" and Tony Blair's "education, education, education".
Setting out a puzzle, pausing and solving it for your audience is another time-honoured technique says Mr Atkinson. For example, Ronald Reagan declared his candidacy for the American presidentia

Reviews for Clonidine to treat Migraine Prevention
|Review by Marissa83:||User Rating:|
clonidine: Will prevent the pain of a migraine if I take it when I first get an aura. If the pain has already set in, it will greatly decrease and shorten the duration of the migraine. Only side effect is that it makes me feel tired, this can be helped if taken with Exedrine. This is the only migraine reliever that's ever been effective for me.

------------answer-----------------------
In the words of one Democrat after John Kerry's long-awaited speech to his party's convention: "He was good, but he's no Clinton." When it comes to public speaking, what does it take to hold a crowd?He may be an experienced and highly adept politician, but even John Kerry's supporters acknowledge their man has a notable weakness: his public persona.
With his speech to the Democratic Party's convention on Thursday Mr Kerry turned in a better performance than many had expected.
But unlike Bill Clinton, or even his running mate, John Edwards, Mr Kerry is judged not to be a natural public speaker.
Of course it's not only politicians who wrestle with this tag. A new guide in the UK exposes some of the heart-stopping clangers that have cropped up in wedding speeches. In one case a groom got his bride's name wrong while another made a business-like presentation complete with overhead projector.
But all is not lost. Here, Max Atkinson, who once trained a public speaking novice to address a political party conference - and saw his pupil receive a standing ovation - delivers the key messages.
LISTS OF THREE
Bad speeches can be disastrous for weddings
Good speeches are memorable ones, and to that end the more rhetoric, the better. A key device in lodging phrases in the minds of an audience is the "list of three", which dates back to Classical times - "veni, vidi, vici (I came, I saw, I conquered)". Then there was "the father, the son and the holy spirit". Later came "liberté, égalité, fraternité" followed by Abraham Lincoln's "government of the people, by the people, for the people".
More latterly, there was former Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell's "fight, fight and fight again [for the party]" and Tony Blair's "education, education, education".
Setting out a puzzle, pausing and solving it for your audience is another time-honoured technique says Mr Atkinson. For example, Ronald Reagan declared his candidacy for the American presidentia

system reveals the clinical impact of inadequate care processes for patients with urgent follow-up needs. By analyzing 111 root cause analyses of diagnostic error cases in the outpatient setting, the authors determined that poorly coordinated care—arising from a lack of systems to track patients needing urgent evaluation, insufficient follow-up of abnormal test results, and inadequate communication between clinicians—contributed to most of the missed or delayed diagnoses. Although electronic medical records (EMRs) should facilitate responding to abnormal test results, prior VA studies have shown that a small but clinically significant proportion of abnormal laboratory tests and radiology studies are not acted upon in a timely fashion (despite the VA having a fully integrated EMR for more than a decade). The authors advocate for refining EMR systems to better facilitate communication between clinicians and for emphasizing teamwork training in the outpatient setting.

I recently attended a perfume making vocational course this month. It was interesting, more of a hands on experience than anything else. The lecturer was well informed and knew a lot about soapmaking and perfumery. There was a bit of confusion with the formulas we were given though since grams and mL were used interchangeably during the discussions. For home makers its not such a big issue since we don’t need to meet regulatory standards.
I made a batch of perfume yesterday. A truly lovely floral blend that lasted more than four hours on my skin. With Tangerine as a top note, it’s an uplifting and cheerful scent. The soft and water floral middle notes make it a light and sweet. I didn’t get a nose full of it at its base note phase, but the other notes make it very light. I took a photo with my smartphone, but it was pretty bad. so no photo for now.
- Top Notes: Tangerine, Sap, Reseda Plant
- Middle Notes: Wild Rose, Red Cyclamen, Peach Blossom, Blue Hyacinth, Iris, Nectar
- Base Note

What issue does Microsoft expect to eliminate by integrating new technologies in ID 2.0
------------correct----------------------
ID 2.0 is actually a giant step forward," Mundie said.
By integrating these two technologies, Microsoft expects to "eliminate the issue of the man-in-the-middle-attack," Mundie said. In these attacks, which are increasingly being used by phishers, a thief steals sensitive information by setting up a fake Web site that passes information back and forth between the victim and the legitimate Web site. OpenID is an emerging open-source standard that simplifies the task of logging on to many different Web sites.

What aspects of John Kerry's past and character emphasize his portrayal as a 'superhero' in the context of his political campaign
------------correct----------------------
John Kerry - Superhero:
In the vicious end of days in this campaign, so much gets lost in the caterwauling of the media. Here's something that's happened in the last couple of days: John Kerry has found the last piece of the puzzle, the final cause to push to the end of the battle. If you've listened to Kerry since the dual revelations of the missing 760,000 pounds of high-powered explosives from a known ammo dump and the coming request for an additional $70 billion dollars for Iraq and Afghanistan, Kerry has become the man we've all heard about - the unstoppable crusader for what's right against however powerful the forces of evil may be. Kerry has been tough-guy posturing for most of the campaign, and it's been a ludicrous sight. How many animals must be hunted and killed in order for a Democrat to look strong on defense? As Bradley Whitford said on Bill Maher's show last week, "How many times does a guy have to be shot in the ass running across rice paddies in Vietnam in order to look tougher than the cheerleader from Andover?"
Here's the deal - what's been missing from the entire Kerry campaign is just how tough a motherfucker John Kerry really, actually is, and it's got jackshit to do with hunting geese and killing the Vietcong. Kerry is a superhero, the kind of valiant son of a bitch who doesn't give a rat's ass about his own life in order to make the lives of others better. It's his post-Vietnam life that makes him a superhero. You don't know how much a superhero the man in the cape is by his origins. You know a superhero by his deeds. And if Kerry loses, it'll be because his campaign refused to acknowledge just how kick-ass Kerry has been since his final purple heart (and if Kerry loses, adviser Bob Shrum, who, in essence, said the public was too stupid to understand Kerry's accomplishments, should be strung up by his balls and batted around like a pinata by the Democratic party leadership until he bursts open and showers everyone with his innards).
Yeah, yeah, this is gonna be a down-on-the-knees-Kerry-supportin-hummer of an entry, but the Rude Pundit keeps talking to people who sigh and say, "I guess I'm gonna vote for Bush" because they can't bring themselves to vote for Kerry. They see him as weak. They see him as a flip-flopper. In other words, they see him as the projection of self that Bush has imposed on Kerry. In other words, these voters are too blinded by the glow that emits from the crown on Bush's head to believe that they own the democracy.
Kerry vs. Nixon: When Kerry helped organize the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, he was directly confronting a hegemonic ideology in the country that said the people must blindly follow their leaders. Kerry, villified at the time with incredible viciousness, did not back down from charges of treason and heresy. Check out the end of the book The New Soldier, which Kerry co-wrote and edited in order to talk about what the young men returning from Vietnam had confronted in the name of "freedom" from Communism. The book is, ironically enough, mostly reprinted on an anti-Kerry site. Kerry writes, "We are asking America to turn from false glory, hollow victory, fabricated foreign threats, fear which

Yeah, yeah, this is gonna be a down-on-the-knees-Kerry-supportin-hummer of an entry, but the Rude Pundit keeps talking to people who sigh and say, "I guess I'm gonna vote for Bush" because they can't bring themselves to vote for Kerry. They see him as weak. They see him as a flip-flopper. In other words, they see him as the projection of self that Bush has imposed on Kerry. In other words, these voters are too blinded by the glow that emits from the crown on Bush's head to believe that they own the democracy.

The book is, ironically enough, mostly reprinted on an anti-Kerry site. Kerry writes, "We are asking America to turn from false glory, hollow victory, fabricated foreign threats, fear which

After what seems like a very long time . . . I am back . . . daring to write again. I was stopped by a day in which four or five folks started following me. Yikes! This really was a public place. Not just my private meanderings.
That is something we all forget, isn’t it? That we ourselves, our lives, our words and our thoughts even, have a wider effect. And, so when I take myself to a church service . . . or to Centering Prayer as I am this morning . . . I am WANTING Your help.

I’m back from my cruise to Mexico, Grand Cayman, and Jamaica, and it was a much needed vacation. Spending 7 days relaxing and going on excursions is a great way to get away from a computer and actually enjoy the fruits of your labor. I know I don’t have a ton of followers like Chow or Yaro, but that’s perfectly fine with me. You also won’t find me sucking on another mans neck either.
I do get emailed quite a bit from people wanting me to train them to make money online. Many of those who sincerely would like to put in the work, and many others who just want to make quick money with little to no work.

Reviews for Clonidine to treat Migraine Prevention
|Review by Marissa83:||User Rating:|
clonidine: Will prevent the pain of a migraine if I take it when I first get an aura. If the pain has already set in, it will greatly decrease and shorten the duration of the migraine. Only side effect is that it makes me feel tired, this can be helped if taken with Exedrine. This is the only migraine reliever that's ever been effective for me.

------------question-----------------------
What material is used to manufacture Roofline Metal Fascia and how does it contribute to its strength
------------correct----------------------
Steel fascia is an integral part of a home’s rainwater system, as they provide a base on the roof into which the guttering can be attached. Roofline’s Fascia systems can be fitted with a range of spoutings to create either a contemporary or traditional finish to your roof. Roofline Metal Fascia is a classic profile with a swage design that looks great and has added strength as it is manufactured using 0.55mm steel for extra strength.
It is part of a well-designed, fascia-gutter system that is easy for the installer to work with because it uses an internal clip arrangement to affix the quad gutter.
Compliance to the New Zealand Building Code
Roofline 0.55 Fascia / 0.55 Gutter complies with the NZ Building Code when installed within the following guidelines:
- Installed on brackets at a maximum of 900mm centres
- With overstraps and spring clips at a maximum of 600mm c

ike-minded mother runners. My content is centered on running and fitness for the everyday athlete. I frequently discuss my adventures with my MRTT group and the Girls on The Run Team I coach. I also share my passion for vegetarian living by hosting a weekly Meatless Monday link up where I share original recipes..co-hosted by A Whisk and Two Wands.
What’s a fun fact about yourself or your blog that the other members in the group may not know yet? I have a master’s in social work with a specialization in eating disorders. I really enjoyed working in the field before I had my kids and retired to be a stay at home mom. I try to use some of those social work skills to coach my girls on the run team. You will usually see me running around with my crew!

utritional area. It’s volume prominence and new-item vitality transformed it into a separate product classification, aided by supermarkets’ emphasis on Whole Health.
6. BIGGEST NEW FORCE IN GENERAL MERCHANDISE FOR 2001. Seasonal non-foods is the fastest growing of GM’s major categories and it was fueled by home décor items, which took off last year as never before. Centered on such events as Easter, Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas, home décor built even more momentum from the effects of 9-11. The national tragedy imparted a consumer mind change that included a need for closeness to home and family.
7. MOST SUCCESSFUL NEW NATIONAL BRAND IN GENERAL MERCHANDSIE FOR 2001. A grocery-store standard, long and short handle brushes and brooms became a staple in non-foods many years ago. It’s been a steady provider of sales and profits with constant product innovation and packaging improvements. But in 2001 Mr. Clean, was licensed to the Butler Co. who devised a new, very attractive line with technical improvements at a price point for its long and short handle stick goods and brush and brooms that took this category to a new level.
8. BEST DIVERSIFICATION IN A PRODUCT LINE FOR 2001. The primarily seasonal business of coolers has spun off a new category that became firmly established last year. The soft insulation wraparound was applied to a multitude of colorful, fashion-oriented products for a 52-week market for lunches, travel, holidays and the school and office. From wrapped bottles to full-size carriers, this high margin line formed a new category of its own.
9. BEST ADVANCE IN CONSUMER CONVENIENCE FOR HBC ITEMS IN 2001. American enterprise and technology with product innovation for the grocery store shelf, once again delivered a product break through in Dove’s new premoistened cleaning cloths from Unilever. It pops up like paper tissues and is impregnated with the same ingredients as their facial soap.
10. BIGGEST CATEGORY UPGRADE IN 2001. Of all the GM categories in all the supermarkets, it was kitchenware, which made the greatest advances in 2001. Upgraded in quality, styling, ergonomic designs, hot colors, and new materials and heftier pricing, kitchen tools, gadgets and related cookware increased in sales like never before. The kitchen center concept came into its own in 2001 as a large numbers of supers gave this category more in-line space and more promotional support.
Thanks to the manufactures, brokers, distributors and retailers for making 2001 another great year for supermarket non-foods.
A happy and prosperous New Year to one and all. May the new year continue to bless the supermarket industry with more new and exciting non-food products and categories in 200

What factors contributed to missed or delayed diagnoses in outpatient settings according to the study
------------correct----------------------
system reveals the clinical impact of inadequate care processes for patients with urgent follow-up needs. By analyzing 111 root cause analyses of diagnostic error cases in the outpatient setting, the authors determined that poorly coordinated care—arising from a lack of systems to track patients needing urgent evaluation, insufficient follow-up of abnormal test results, and inadequate communication between clinicians—contributed to most of the missed or delayed diagnoses. Although electronic medical records (EMRs) should facilitate responding to abnormal test results, prior VA studies have shown that a small but clinically significant proportion of abnormal laboratory tests and radiology studies are not acted upon in a timely fashion (despite the VA having a fully integrated EMR for more than a decade). The authors advocate for refining EMR systems to better facilitate communication between clinicians and for emphasizing teamwork training in the outpatient setting.
Journal Article > Review
Taub N, Baker R, Khunti K, et al. Diabet Med. 2010;27:1322-1326.
This study found little research on safety improvement methods in the primary care of diabetes.

Ten Products & Programs That Made a Difference in 2001 By Mike Sleeper, Chief Executive Officer, Imperial Distributors, Inc.
New non-food items by the hundreds pour into supermarket shelves every year and dozens of new programs and setups are initiated or expanded. Last year was no exception. As always, it was a busy time with a good number of new products and programs scoring standout success. Overall, the trend in non-foods was towards upgraded product, quality enhanced through technology and innovation and increased higher unit value which fueled total non-food dollar volume–at a time when dry grocery sales were flat.
Of the numerous new entries and programs, these ten stood out as star performers in 2001.
1. BEST WOMENS HBC ITEM IN 2001. Disposable shavers were said to be taking over the men’s wet shaving business. But one manufacturer, Gillette, focused on improving their replaceable blade system and reversed the tide, first with Sensor and then with Mach 3. The women’s shaving business, however, stayed largely in disposables – but now Gillette has done it again with its new Venus shaver. Introduced in late 2000, and firmly established market share in 2001, Venus was a better product that provided a higher ring and grew the entire women’s shaving category.
2. BEST CHILDREN’S HBC LINE IN 2001. Several licensed kiddie HBC products came out in 2001, but the launch of J&J’s new line of Harry Potter Toiletries for Children was spectacular. Almost instantly, it captured a big share of the children’s shampoo/hair care/bath care market. Themed on the awesomely popular series of books and the record-breaking movie release, the new brand was the most successful HBC children’s line for 2001.
3. BIGGEST CONSUMER TRADE-UP IN THE SUPERMARKET FOR 2001. Weber’s Gemini Gas Grill raised the price-tag bar to new heights, $450. This seasonal staple with price point for supermarkets worked well because it was in line with the toughest discounters’. Because of its high ring, the grill–actually outsold in sheer dollar sales most summer seasonal GM SKU’s, and beat out the traditional $99.00 gas grill import.
4. BREAKTHROUGH IN ORAL CARE IN 2001. Significant advances in oral care were made last year with a new product that provides both value and efficiency for supermarket consumers. Procter & Gamble’s Whitening Strips put technology to work to bleach teeth at a $40 price point, which although high for the oral department, was well below the $400 cost at the dentist’s office.
5. FASTEST GROWTH CATEGTORY IN 2001. The nutrition/power bar category has been growing steadily, but its 2001sales advances were so remarkable that it became the No.1 growth leader in the important vitamins/supplement/n

What is the main purpose of the Facebook group Healthy Living Community
------------correct----------------------
A roundup of the best content from the members of the Facebook group, Healthy Living Community! Get to know the members of this group and consider joining yourself to BOOST your own blog.
If there is one thing I have learned through my 8(!) years of blogging, it’s that each blogger grows and becomes a better content creator by helping and supporting those around them. I owe so much of my success and learning from other people in the healthy living (and general) blogging community. As the saying goes…
We push each other to get better. We could never be as good alone as we are together.
That’s why about 2.5 years ago, two blogger friends and I started a Facebook group in which bloggers like ourselves could share, support, and learn from one another. Formerly known as Healthy Living Blogging Boost, the Healthy Living Community is a group is all about supporting other healthy living bloggers through daily social media share threads and weekly follow threads. Together we will grow our blogs, learn from each other, and have some fun in the process! This is a place for support, sharing, and questions! We highly encourage and a appreciate participation.
We have our own Pinterest board (for members of the group only!), have made long-lasting friendships & business connections, and have all witness our blogs grow as a result of the daily interactions within the group.
Starting this month, I will be hosting an end of month link-up to highlight some of the amazing work done by our members. In addition, we will have a member spotlight each month to feature on of our fabulous members who actively participates, engages in, and supports the group.
If you have your own Healthy Living Blog and want more info on HLC or want to join the fun, click here!
And now to kick things off with our May feature and link love…

What was noted as the biggest new force in general merchandise for 2001
------------correct----------------------
utritional area. It’s volume prominence and new-item vitality transformed it into a separate product classification, aided by supermarkets’ emphasis on Whole Health.
6. BIGGEST NEW FORCE IN GENERAL MERCHANDISE FOR 2001. Seasonal non-foods is the fastest growing of GM’s major categories and it was fueled by home décor items, which took off last year as never before. Centered on such events as Easter, Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas, home décor built even more momentum from the effects of 9-11. The national tragedy imparted a consumer mind change that included a need for closeness to home and family.
7. MOST SUCCESSFUL NEW NATIONAL BRAND IN GENERAL MERCHANDSIE FOR 2001. A grocery-store standard, long and short handle brushes and brooms became a staple in non-foods many years ago. It’s been a steady provider of sales and profits with constant product innovation and packaging improvements. But in 2001 Mr. Clean, was licensed to the Butler Co. who devised a new, very attractive line with technical improvements at a price point for its long and short handle stick goods and brush and brooms that took this category to a new level.
8. BEST DIVERSIFICATION IN A PRODUCT LINE FOR 2001. The primarily seasonal business of coolers has spun off a new category that became firmly established last year. The soft insulation wraparound was applied to a multitude of colorful, fashion-oriented products for a 52-week market for lunches, travel, holidays and the school and office. From wrapped bottles to full-size carriers, this high margin line formed a new category of its own.
9. BEST ADVANCE IN CONSUMER CONVENIENCE FOR HBC ITEMS IN 2001. American enterprise and technology with product innovation for the grocery store shelf, once again delivered a product break through in Dove’s new premoistened cleaning cloths from Unilever. It pops up like paper tissues and is impregnated with the same ingredients as their facial soap.
10. BIGGEST CATEGORY UPGRADE IN 2001. Of all the GM categories in all the supermarkets, it was kitchenware, which made the greatest advances in 2001. Upgraded in quality, styling, ergonomic designs, hot colors, and new materials and heftier pricing, kitchen tools, gadgets and related cookware increased in sales like never before. The kitchen center concept came into its own in 2001 as a large numbers of supers gave this category more in-line space and more promotional support.
Thanks to the manufactures, brokers, distributors and retailers for making 2001 another great year for supermarket non-foods.
A happy and prosperous New Year to one and all. May the new year continue to bless the supermarket industry with more new and exciting non-food products and categories in 200

What were some of the standout products and programs in non-food items that made a difference in supermarkets in 2001
------------correct----------------------
Ten Products & Programs That Made a Difference in 2001 By Mike Sleeper, Chief Executive Officer, Imperial Distributors, Inc.
New non-food items by the hundreds pour into supermarket shelves every year and dozens of new programs and setups are initiated or expanded. Last year was no exception. As always, it was a busy time with a good number of new products and programs scoring standout success. Overall, the trend in non-foods was towards upgraded product, quality enhanced through technology and innovation and increased higher unit value which fueled total non-food dollar volume–at a time when dry grocery sales were flat.
Of the numerous new entries and programs, these ten stood out as star performers in 2001.
1. BEST WOMENS HBC ITEM IN 2001. Disposable shavers were said to be taking over the men’s wet shaving business. But one manufacturer, Gillette, focused on improving their replaceable blade system and reversed the tide, first with Sensor and then with Mach 3. The women’s shaving business, however, stayed largely in disposables – but now Gillette has done it again with its new Venus shaver. Introduced in late 2000, and firmly established market share in 2001, Venus was a better product that provided a higher ring and grew the entire women’s shaving category.
2. BEST CHILDREN’S HBC LINE IN 2001. Several licensed kiddie HBC products came out in 2001, but the launch of J&J’s new line of Harry Potter Toiletries for Children was spectacular. Almost instantly, it captured a big share of the children’s shampoo/hair care/bath care market. Themed on the awesomely popular series of books and the record-breaking movie release, the new brand was the most successful HBC children’s line for 2001.
3. BIGGEST CONSUMER TRADE-UP IN THE SUPERMARKET FOR 2001. Weber’s Gemini Gas Grill raised the price-tag bar to new heights, $450. This seasonal staple with price point for supermarkets worked well because it was in line with the toughest discounters’. Because of its high ring, the grill–actually outsold in sheer dollar sales most summer seasonal GM SKU’s, and beat out the traditional $99.00 gas grill import.
4. BREAKTHROUGH IN ORAL CARE IN 2001. Significant advances in oral care were made last year with a new product that provides both value and efficiency for supermarket consumers. Procter & Gamble’s Whitening Strips put technology to work to bleach teeth at a $40 price point, which although high for the oral department, was well below the $400 cost at the dentist’s office.
5. FASTEST GROWTH CATEGTORY IN 2001. The nutrition/power bar category has been growing steadily, but its 2001sales advances were so remarkable that it became the No.1 growth leader in the important vitamins/supplement/n

A roundup of the best content from the members of the Facebook group, Healthy Living Community! Get to know the members of this group and consider joining yourself to BOOST your own blog.
If there is one thing I have learned through my 8(!) years of blogging, it’s that each blogger grows and becomes a better content creator by helping and supporting those around them. I owe so much of my success and learning from other people in the healthy living (and general) blogging community. As the saying goes…
We push each other to get better. We could never be as good alone as we are together.
That’s why about 2.5 years ago, two blogger friends and I started a Facebook group in which bloggers like ourselves could share, support, and learn from one another. Formerly known as Healthy Living Blogging Boost, the Healthy Living Community is a group is all about supporting other healthy living bloggers through daily social media share threads and weekly follow threads. Together we will grow our blogs, learn from each other, and have some fun in the process! This is a place for support, sharing, and questions! We highly encourage and a appreciate participation.
We have our own Pinterest board (for members of the group only!), have made long-lasting friendships & business connections, and have all witness our blogs grow as a result of the daily interactions within the group.
Starting this month, I will be hosting an end of month link-up to highlight some of the amazing work done by our members. In addition, we will have a member spotlight each month to feature on of our fabulous members who actively participates, engages in, and supports the group.
If you have your own Healthy Living Blog and want more info on HLC or want to join the fun, click here!
And now to kick things off with our May feature and link love…

------------correct----------------------
Good Morning, God!
After what seems like a very long time . . . I am back . . . daring to write again. I was stopped by a day in which four or five folks started following me. Yikes! This really was a public place. Not just my private meanderings.

And, so when I take myself to a church service . . . or to Centering Prayer as I am this morning . . . I am WANTING Your help. Knowing I need help . . . knowing that being human is a big and complex deal.

With tonight’s Winter Classic dropping the puck at 8 p.m. we see two teams that are indeed rivals that are sitting at the top of the Eastern Conference. Don’t let their place in the standings fool you though, there are stark differences between the two and how they’re playing leading into tonight’s game.
Washington has put their eight-game losing streak behind them and they’ve won four of their last five games but that one loss in the middle of that is to Pittsburgh. With the teams only meeting four times this season, each game brings a special kind of heat to it and with tonight’s game being the Winter Classic, the pressure is intense to win each game to prove a point.
But who needs to win this game more? For us, the answer is obvious. Washington needs to get a win tonight and if you’ve seen any part of HBO’s 24/7 you know why. The Capitals need a confidence boost.
The Caps’ recent success is good for them because it keeps them from being the quiet and sullen team they appeared to be on 24/7. That said, getting wins over Ottawa, New Jersey, and Carolina aren’t really awe-inspiring. Their 3-0 shutout win over Montreal was a solid psychological boost after their failure against Montreal last year. A win against the Penguins in Pittsburgh today in front of 65,000 fans is the exact kind of win this temperamental Caps team needs to stay focused and to completely put that miserable losing streak in the past for good.
What would be best for Washington would be to beat Pittsburgh and beat them handily with their offensive stars like

What is the recommended approach to removing wall claddings according to the text
------------correct----------------------
ve it in the opposite direction the nails are pointed. If you have access to only one side of the wall that means pulling it free rather than pounding through it.
Stanley’s FatMax FUBAR III is a professional grade tool made with solid steel construction and no-mercy design. I use its duck-billed jaw to plunge through the wall cladding, and then I’ll hook the lath behind it. One good yank and heaps of plaster crack free. Keep going, you’ll see the path to the lath.
I’ve also used the DemoDawg tools with excellent success. Again, plunge the flat-bar-like nose of the tool behind the cladding and lever or pull everything else off.
Next demo tool on the list is a unique one called the Gutster. This is a universal demo tool that appears equally at home stripping shingles (which I’m doing with it now) as it does ripping up deck boards or taking down plaster–which I have not done yet with it. Stay tuned on that one. We have some interior demo coming up that I’m looking forward to.
The take-away here: When it comes to wall claddings, to trash it, don’t smash it. Get a rugged tool behind it and pull. Or, if you’re stripping both sides of the wall, pull off one side then push off the other from the back-side.
Smart beats brutal almost every time.

ve it in the opposite direction the nails are pointed. If you have access to only one side of the wall that means pulling it free rather than pounding through it.
Stanley’s FatMax FUBAR III is a professional grade tool made with solid steel construction and no-mercy design. I use its duck-billed jaw to plunge through the wall cladding, and then I’ll hook the lath behind it. One good yank and heaps of plaster crack free. Keep going, you’ll see the path to the lath.
I’ve also used the DemoDawg tools with excellent success. Again, plunge the flat-bar-like nose of the tool behind the cladding and lever or pull everything else off.
Next demo tool on the list is a unique one called the Gutster. This is a universal demo tool that appears equally at home stripping shingles (which I’m doing with it now) as it does ripping up deck boards or taking down plaster–which I have not done yet with it. Stay tuned on that one. We have some interior demo coming up that I’m looking forward to.
The take-away here: When it comes to wall claddings, to trash it, don’t smash it. Get a rugged tool behind it and pull. Or, if you’re stripping both sides of the wall, pull off one side then push off the other from the back-side.
Smart beats brutal almost every time.

It’s a version of Burberry weekend, I didn’t hand blend the fine fragrance but I’m happy with the essence of perfume I made with it. I sold one, gave some away as a gift, and kept about an ounce of it to reflect on in the future.
I used the formula here.
Be sure to use a glass bottle to prevent the scent from evaporating. Plastic is more porous and will allow air in and evaporate the fragrance. In a month this will result in an icky alcohol smelling spritz.
I would also advise you to use verbac, or denatured (sometimes called deodorized) ethyl alcohol. This skips the one-week curing stage and your fragrance becomes ready to use.
I gave my mom some, and she used wayyyyyyyy too much. For some reason, my allergies acted up when I went into the room she was using. The fine fragrance I used is definitely not phlatelet free. If you are sensitive too, I suggest you hand blend a fine fragrance blend using the note information above using Essential oils or E.O.s

What ingredients were included in the perfume blend mentioned in the text
------------correct----------------------
s: Cedarwood, Sandalwood, Musk
It’s a version of Burberry weekend, I didn’t hand blend the fine fragrance but I’m happy with the essence of perfume I made with it. I sold one, gave some away as a gift, and kept about an ounce of it to reflect on in the future.
I used the formula here.
Be sure to use a glass bottle to prevent the scent from evaporating. Plastic is more porous and will allow air in and evaporate the fragrance. In a month this will result in an icky alcohol smelling spritz.
I would also advise you to use verbac, or denatured (sometimes called deodorized) ethyl alcohol. This skips the one-week curing stage and your fragrance becomes ready to use.
I gave my mom some, and she used wayyyyyyyy too much. For some reason, my allergies acted up when I went into the room she was using. The fine fragrance I used is definitely not phlatelet free. If you are sensitive too, I suggest you hand blend a fine fragrance blend using the note information above using Essential oils or E.O.s

What common misconception do people have about the appropriate tool for demolition in bathroom remodeling
------------correct----------------------
We begin our bathroom’s anti-transmogrification by gutting it. The birch paneling (ack!), plaster, lath, strapping–all of it has to go leaving us with the tabula rasa of the home’s structural terra cotta block walls so we can frame new walls against it.
The Wrong Tool for the Job
And what’s the tool many people think of when they hear “demolition?” Right. Sledgehammer.
I know why.
On nearly every home renovation TV show I’ve ever seen, TV contractors and homeowners start the camera-friendly demolition by pounding mercilessly through drywall, plaster, lath, corner-bead, etc., with blunt-force trauma.
I guess it makes good reality TV, but it doesn’t make good reality. There’s almost no tool I can think of that’s less appropriate than a sledgehammer–especially if you’re backed up against a wall that isn’t supposed to be damaged. Note: A sledgehammer does have a specialized place in old-house bathroom remodeling, which I’ll get to in a future post.
The Right Tools for the Job
Complaints, however, are useless without solutions, so without further adieu here are some of my favorite appetite-for-destruction, rip-’em-and-strip’em, take-no-prisoners demolitions tools and techniques.
The first thing to realize about plaster and wood lath (or 1-by floor sheathing, corner bead, board-and-bead paneling, etc.) is that it is way easier to remo

------------question-----------------------
What techniques can speakers use to enhance the impact of their speeches, according to Max Atkinson
------------correct----------------------
l election in 1980 by offering up these words: "This is a moment of quite some mixed emotions for me... I haven't been on prime-time TV for quite a while." Another memorable example is Margaret Thatcher's "You turn if you want to... the lady's not for turning."
COMBINING THE TWO
The average applause during a speech lasts about eight seconds, says Mr Atkinson. For a more rapturous reception combine these two techniques. Benjamin Disraeli carried it off well with "There are three kinds of lies... lies, damned lies and statistics, while the full Tony Blair quote actually went "ask me my three priorities... education, education, education."
A "master" of imagery in speeches, says Max Atkinson
Imagery requires the use of skilful similes. Think Denis Healey's observation that being attacked by [Tory chancellor] Geoffrey Howe was "like being savaged by a dead sheep". Or Muhammad Ali's "float like a butterfly, sting like a bee." Martin Luther King was the master of imagery, says Mr Atkinson, noting how his "I Have a Dream" speech started with an extended banking simile. "We have come to our nation's capital to cash a cheque" before going on to talk of the "tranquilising drug of gradualism".
Amplification and the prevalence of wireless microphones enable speakers to get away from the lectern and walk as they talk. Mr Atkinson approves, so long as the speaker's movements aren't monotonous. "Moving around helps to drain the adrenalin; stops the build up of physical tension."
The words alone are not enough. The best public speakers practise their delivery. "When I first started working with Paddy Ashdown he never practised his speeches," recalls Mr Atkinson of the former Lib Dem leader. "It never occurred to him. But I advised him and after that he would practise hard to the extent he would read his speech out to an empty conference hall the night before."Lend Me Your Ears by Max Atkinson will be published in September by Random House

------------question-----------------------
What significant actions did John Kerry take to oppose powerful administrations in his political career
------------correct----------------------
threatens us as a nation, shallow pride which feeds off fear, and mostly from the promises which have proven so deceiving these past ten years." Change "ten" to "four," and you get the idea. The rest of the essay is stunningly humble, and it is simply a call to be citizens with eyes and ears open, to allow that maybe the powerful are more concerned with keeping power than with admitting error. And it is horribly, frighteningly prescient. What people forget about Kerry's protest days is that he was defending the lives of soldiers and that he was right.
Kerry vs. Reagan: When Kerry faced down the Reagan administration in his dogged pursuit of the Contra-drug connection, he was a freshman Senator taking on one of the most popular Presidents in American history. Instead of backing down from repeated threats to his political career, Kerry had his staff stay on the case like a viper injecting venom into your leg. They would have had to cut off his head in order to get him to stop, and he stayed on it until he revealed that the Reagan administration allowed the Contras to smuggle cocaine into the U.S. in order to fund their CIA-led "war" against the legally-elected Sandinistas in Nicaragua. (And thus helping to cause the crack epidemic.) Kerry was called a conspiracy theorist, said to be interfering with other drug cases, and impugned throughout the media. But the part that rarely got told is that he was right.
Kerry vs. Bush I: When Kerry went after the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, which was involved in laundering the Contra drug money, funneling money from the U.S. to Saddam Hussein (when he was our beloved dictator), and supporting illegal arms trade with terrorists and drug lords (including Afghanistan), it was his first chance to take on the Bush dynasty. When Bush I was in power, the administration and the CIA overlooked the crimes of BCCI, possibly because the bank was intimately involved in the financial dealings of the Bush family. Kerry had already kicked ass on the savings and loan scandals of the 1980s, so why not fuck with George H.W. Bush if 41 was fucking over the good of the country and the world? He brought down BCCI, and he cut off a vital funding source for terrorists. Again, Kerry was bucking the will of Democrats in Congress, as well as a Republican administration, in order to do what he knew was right.
Listen closely and tell anyone you know who is still thinking about voting for Bush: has Bush ever, personally, faced down anyone other than with a chant of "Drink, drink, drink"? Has he ever gone against someone who was really, truly powerful in order to place the good of the people above his own good? No. Heroes do that - they don't care what's in their way - they will face down evil, no matter how powerful. And they don't bother with those who are too weak to fight. It's why the latest news from Iraq fanned the fire: those in charge have screwed us over again, and Kerry's ready to bring the superhero costume out. Call him "the Winter Soldier."
Kerry's done a fuck of a lot more than pull a guy out of a river. And the fact that America doesn't know that says a great deal about how we negotiate our desolate political landscape

threatens us as a nation, shallow pride which feeds off fear, and mostly from the promises which have proven so deceiving these past ten years." Change "ten" to "four," and you get the idea. The rest of the essay is stunningly humble, and it is simply a call to be citizens with eyes and ears open, to allow that maybe the powerful are more concerned with keeping power than with admitting error. And it is horribly, frighteningly prescient. What people forget about Kerry's protest days is that he was defending the lives of soldiers and that he was right.
Kerry vs. Reagan: When Kerry faced down the Reagan administration in his dogged pursuit of the Contra-drug connection, he was a freshman Senator taking on one of the most popular Presidents in American history. Instead of backing down from repeated threats to his political career, Kerry had his staff stay on the case like a viper injecting venom into your leg. They would have had to cut off his head in order to get him to stop, and he stayed on it until he revealed that the Reagan administration allowed the Contras to smuggle cocaine into the U.S. in order to fund their CIA-led "war" against the legally-elected Sandinistas in Nicaragua. (And thus helping to cause the crack epidemic.) Kerry was called a conspiracy theorist, said to be interfering with other drug cases, and impugned throughout the media. But the part that rarely got told is that he was right.

l election in 1980 by offering up these words: "This is a moment of quite some mixed emotions for me... I haven't been on prime-time TV for quite a while." Another memorable example is Margaret Thatcher's "You turn if you want to... the lady's not for turning."
COMBINING THE TWO
The average applause during a speech lasts about eight seconds, says Mr Atkinson. For a more rapturous reception combine these two techniques. Benjamin Disraeli carried it off well with "There are three kinds of lies... lies, damned lies and statistics, while the full Tony Blair quote actually went "ask me my three priorities... education, education, education."
A "master" of imagery in speeches, says Max Atkinson
Imagery requires the use of skilful similes. Think Denis Healey's observation that being attacked by [Tory chancellor] Geoffrey Howe was "like being savaged by a dead sheep". Or Muhammad Ali's "float like a butterfly, sting like a bee." Martin Luther King was the master of imagery, says Mr Atkinson, noting how his "I Have a Dream" speech started with an extended banking simile. "We have come to our nation's capital to cash a cheque" before going on to talk of the "tranquilising drug of gradualism".
Amplification and the prevalence of wireless microphones enable speakers to get away from the lectern and walk as they talk. Mr Atkinson approves, so long as the speaker's movements aren't monotonous. "Moving around helps to drain the adrenalin; stops the build up of physical tension."
The words alone are not enough. The best public speakers practise their delivery. "When I first started working with Paddy Ashdown he never practised his speeches," recalls Mr Atkinson of the former Lib Dem leader. "It never occurred to him. But I advised him and after that he would practise hard to the extent he would read his speech out to an empty conference hall the night before."Lend Me Your Ears by Max Atkinson will be published in September by Random House

------------question-----------------------
What are the implications of the game for both Washington and Pittsburgh based on their current standings and player lineup
------------correct----------------------
Alex Ovechkin, Alexander Semin, and Nicklas Backstrom all finding the score sheet. Ovechkin is having a solid season, but his goal numbers are down compared to previous seasons. The lingering feeling that Ovechkin has a goal eruption coming hangs over the team and once it happens (if it happens) the high-scoring Caps we got accustomed to seeing will be back in a big way.
That’s not to say this game isn’t big for the Penguins. The Pens are getting Jordan Staal back in their lineup tonight and that means for the first time this year, the Pens have their full compliment of great players back on the ice. We’ll get a look at how Staal looks with Evgeni Malkin on his wing and if that’s the thing the Penguins needed to take control of the Eastern Conference races.
As it is, the Pens are four points up on both Washington and Tampa Bay for the overall lead in the East. The Pens getting another win, ideally a regulation win with just two points for them and none for the Caps, would work two-fold. The Pens would extend their lead and they’d also deliver a psychological blow to Washington, something that could linger with them all year long.
Overall though, this game is a must-win for Washington. If it turns into another game where they fall behind early and try to gut it out, it creates unnecessary drama for them. After all, moral victories aren’t counted in the standings and when it comes to Pittsburgh, racking up those kinds of wins doesn’t do anything to help them out in the long run and for Washington, that’s what matters the most.

go, complaining to You that the human brain was too thin to deal with my powerful reptilian brain. Sigh. I do have upwellings of my deeper selves. But, they have ENERGY and STRENGTH in them! They are MY RESPONSIBILITY to manage . . . to love and care for. Double sigh!
So, today, Silent Saturday, — that profound gap between the Death of Jesus and the Resurrection of Jesus — seems like a very good time to resume our conversation. I think it was Father Keating who said, “Silence is God’s first language. All else is a poor translation.”
Ah, help me to be silent, too. And to listen with my heart.

Catapres (clonidine): Clonidine will prevent a migraine for me, if I take it as soon as the headache is starting, and sometimes even helps after it's under way. Of course, the drug does cause wooziness, so I have to be careful about standing up or making other sudden moves. It's very effective, and cheap. Give it a 10.
