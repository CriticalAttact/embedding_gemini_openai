------------question-----------------------
What actions is the mother taking to regain custody of her daughter after the adoption proceedings have started
------------correct----------------------
en into care.
Adoption proceedings were initiated and the woman was, according to a judge, “dispatched with undue haste” back to Italy.
But she has since been receiving treatment for her condition and has been holding down a job and maintaining her own home as well as staging a legal battle to halt the adoption and win her daughter back.
She returned to Britain earlier this year for a hearing at Chelmsford County Court at which Judge Roderick Newton found her to be articulate and coherent in making her case.
Papers from the hearing disclose that the initial decision to take the child into care almost immediately after her birth was against even the wishes of doctors.
Judge Newton noted: “The District Judge at the early stage gave permission for the Local Authority to withhold contact.
“I raise that because doctors appear to be saying at an early stage in the proceedings that the plan ought to be for [the child] to be placed with the mother, potentially in hospital.”
But he upheld the earlier decision insisting that this would not have been in the girl’s interests.
They asset out how the mother pledged to prove herself.
She has suggested that the child remain with foster carers for a year so that she can demonstrate that she is committed to taking her medication. The offer was rejected and the court granted social services permission to place the child up for adoption.
But last night a spokesman for the judiciary disclosed that Sir James had that the case be transferred to a higher court before an adoption order is granted.
"The proceedings are not yet concluded,” he said.
“The President has ordered that the matter be transferred to the High Court and any further applications in respect of the child are to be heard by him.”
Lucy Scott-Moncrieff, former president of the Law Society, said: “It is certainly not uncommon for children to be taken at point of birth away from their mothers if it’s thought their mothers can’t look after them.
“It’s also not unknown for women to have caesarean sections ordered by the court and of course it’s not unknown for people to be detained under the mental health act."

What were the reasons given for the court's decision to deny the mother a chance to spend time with her newborn daughter after the caesarean section
------------correct----------------------
A mother whose baby girl was forcibly delivered by caesarean section and put up for adoption was denied the chance to spend even the first few days of her child’s life with her, it has emerged.
Doctors recommended allowing the woman, who cannot be named, to have her child with her in hospital while arrangements were made for the future but were turned down by a court which met behind closed doors.
The child, who cannot be named, was taken from her mother’s womb under a court order because of safety fears because of her mother’s mental state.
The mother, who is an Italian citizen, suffers from a bipolar condition but has, according to a recent court hearing, recently turned her life around and is now fighting an impassioned campaign to halt the adoption and have her child returned to her.
She was sent back to her native Italy after care proceedings got under way but made clear last night that she is still fighting to get her daughter back.
It also emerged last night that Britain’s most senior family judge, Sir James Munby, the President of the High Court Family Division, has personally intervened to take over the case.
The incident has thrown the spotlight on activities of the Court of Protection, the branch of the High Court with powers to make life and death decisions about vulnerable people in private and send people to prison in secret for breaching its orders. MPs have also voiced alarm at the issues exposed by the case.
It is understood that the mother had a history of “manic episodes” dating back several years and had been in and out of hospitals.
She was pregnant when she came to Britain on a short visit in June of last year but her condition deteriorated after a panic attack and she was sectioned under the Mental Health Act.
In August the local health trust secured an order from the Court of Protection for an order to have her child delivered under caesarean section citing “risks to mother and child”.
Although she was allowed to see her baby on the day of the birth and again on the following day, social workers from Essex County Council immediately applied for an order to have the child tak

Absolutely lovely job with our lovely accent pieces today, ladies! Let's just move into something unrelated and do "Ballet and Ballerinas" next. Paintings or photography acceptable.

[Mesa-dev] Mesa (d3d1x): d3d1x: add new Direct3D 10/11 COM state tracker for Gallium

The state tracker does not contain code derived from the DDK and
doesn't need any Microsoft code or tools except the Microsoft HLSL
compiler to compile shaders ahead of time (precompiled shaders are
Also, as far as I know, the DDK does not contain any "code"
implementing Direct3D (except possibly examples), but just the headers
normally used by Windows driver developers
Why are you claiming this?
I assume it's because of the comment in tpf.h, which states that it
has been written according to Microsoft's documentation, which is
available solely from reading the d3d11TokenizedProgramFormat.h header
in the DDK.
Using the header, which is documented in the DDK documentation as the
place to look for documentation of the format, as reference, doesn't
seem to me unusual or problematic.
tpf.h is not a derivative work of that header, and it is designed in a
completely different way: the Microsoft header uses accessor macros,
while tpf.h defines structs and unions with bitf

en into care.
Adoption proceedings were initiated and the woman was, according to a judge, “dispatched with undue haste” back to Italy.
But she has since been receiving treatment for her condition and has been holding down a job and maintaining her own home as well as staging a legal battle to halt the adoption and win her daughter back.
She returned to Britain earlier this year for a hearing at Chelmsford County Court at which Judge Roderick Newton found her to be articulate and coherent in making her case.
Papers from the hearing disclose that the initial decision to take the child into care almost immediately after her birth was against even the wishes of doctors.
Judge Newton noted: “The District Judge at the early stage gave permission for the Local Authority to withhold contact.
“I raise that because doctors appear to be saying at an early stage in the proceedings that the plan ought to be for [the child] to be placed with the mother, potentially in hospital.”
But he upheld the earlier decision insisting that this would not have been in the girl’s interests.
They asset out how the mother pledged to prove herself.
She has suggested that the child remain with foster carers for a year so that she can demonstrate that she is committed to taking her medication. The offer was rejected and the court granted social services permission to place the child up for adoption.
But last night a spokesman for the judiciary disclosed that Sir James had that the case be transferred to a higher court before an adoption order is granted.
"The proceedings are not yet concluded,” he said.
“The President has ordered that the matter be transferred to the High Court and any further applications in respect of the child are to be heard by him.”
Lucy Scott-Moncrieff, former president of the Law Society, said: “It is certainly not uncommon for children to be taken at point of birth away from their mothers if it’s thought their mothers can’t look after them.
“It’s also not unknown for women to have caesarean sections ordered by the court and of course it’s not unknown for people to be detained under the mental health act."

Sometimes Carbachol is called Carboptic drops. The latter effect may be at heightened because both Propiomazine and effective prescription medicine are gabaa agonists. Treatment with Candesartan and Propiomazine give false positive screening results.

Here again, Duchamp’s technical-schematic way of thinking and drawing is evident, as well as his expression of intimate feelings. This work is autobiographical (in Munich, as a young man of 24) and it is about his tragic love for Gabrielle Buffet-Picabia, who was married to his artist friend Francis Picabia. He once drove 700 km from Munich to the French Jura region, just to meet with her for a few hours in the waiting room of a small train station. The work is about a woman who is harassed by two men, which is clearly shown in the composition (the aggressive middle and end parts, the intimate middle part). The painting (pencil, ink and ink on colored paper) hangs in the Centre Pompidou in Paris.

It does not seem to me that this code is more similar to Microsoft
headers than the existing code in Wine.
Also, unlike the Wine d3d10 implementation, this implementation only
cares about the documented API and doesn't attempt to implement
internal APIs as the Wine implementation appears to do, and hence
seems better in that regard.

Your contributions would be greatly welcome and appreciated, both to
r600g and to this code, especially since you are one of the authors of

I don't think there are serious concerns affecting that, and if there

fedpkg uses the bodhi CLI to create the Bodhi update. The bodhi CLI

------------question-----------------------
What formation is Alabama's offensive line experimenting with that could affect their play before the game against Penn State
------------correct----------------------
TUSCALOOSA _ Just the mere mention brings a wide-eye look to the face of University of Alabama sophomore running back Trent Richardson.
The Crimson Tide initially showed it against San Jose State, on the wildcat end-around carry by wide receiver Julio Jones, who turned it into a 13-yard gain. The primary blockers in front of him, lined up next to one another on the left side were massive tackles James Carpenter and D.J. Fluker.
On Tuesday that combination went to another level when during the observation period of practice Carpenter lined up outside of Fluker on the right side where a tight end might normally be. Apparently the idea isn't just a mere flash on the formation radar, but something every opponent will have to prepare for.
"You got some big boys to run behind and they're taking care of you," Richardson said. "I'm not scared of anything when I run behind them, not at all."
While it'll be a hit with fans, and figures to be this year's equivalent to putting nose tackle Terrence Cody in the backfield near the goal-line, when it comes to Alabama that's about it in terms of unorthodox play-calling. Granted, the Crimson Tide will try a trick play every once in a while, especially if the coaches notice something on film, but otherwise the closest thing to being untraditional in Tuscaloosa is probably the pistol formation or someone other than the quarterback taking a snap.
"The wildcat package is something that a lot of teams are preparing for more," sophomore guard Barrett Jones said. "They kind of recognize it and call things for it more, but that's fine with us. Everyone's seen the wildcat.
"It is something we definitely want to do, but we also just want to line up and knock people off the ball."
That's what makes this Saturday's game at Bryant-Denny Stadium such a treat for football purists, because Penn State pretty much plays the same way. It even translates down to both teams wearing such simple, yet elegant uniforms -- many believe the best in college football.
"We have a circle around Penn State just because of the standard of excellence they have," junior linebacker Chris Jordan said. "They're going to come out and play hard-nosed football and we like that. We have a standard of excellence ourselves, of being tough to the point of attack, and we're going to just come out and play our type of defense. On offense we're going to go at all cylinders and try and put points on the board.
"They're going to try and hit us in the mouth so we better be ready. That's what we've been preparing for this week, a tough game."
Ironically, it comes immediately after the most difficult opponent in terms of preparation, San Jose State. New head coach Mike McIntyre was previously the defensive coordinator at Duke, defensive coordinator Kent Baer last held that position at Washington (2005-07) and no one knew for sure what kind of offense the Spartans would execute. Consequently, Alabama spent time preparing for things it never saw in the game.
This is the exact opposite. With Joe Paterno in his 45th year as head coach, and 61st year at Penn State, the Nittany Lions are pretty much a what-you-see-is-what-you-get team.
"I'm really looking forward to it," sophomore lineback

TUSCALOOSA _ Just the mere mention brings a wide-eye look to the face of University of Alabama sophomore running back Trent Richardson.
The Crimson Tide initially showed it against San Jose State, on the wildcat end-around carry by wide receiver Julio Jones, who turned it into a 13-yard gain. The primary blockers in front of him, lined up next to one another on the left side were massive tackles James Carpenter and D.J. Fluker.
On Tuesday that combination went to another level when during the observation period of practice Carpenter lined up outside of Fluker on the right side where a tight end might normally be. Apparently the idea isn't just a mere flash on the formation radar, but something every opponent will have to prepare for.
"You got some big boys to run behind and they're taking care of you," Richardson said. "I'm not scared of anything when I run behind them, not at all."
While it'll be a hit with fans, and figures to be this year's equivalent to putting nose tackle Terrence Cody in the backfield near the goal-line, when it comes to Alabama that's about it in terms of unorthodox play-calling. Granted, the Crimson Tide will try a trick play every once in a while, especially if the coaches notice something on film, but otherwise the closest thing to being untraditional in Tuscaloosa is probably the pistol formation or someone other than the quarterback taking a snap.
"The wildcat package is something that a lot of teams are preparing for more," sophomore guard Barrett Jones said. "They kind of recognize it and call things for it more, but that's fine with us. Everyone's seen the wildcat.
"It is something we definitely want to do, but we also just want to line up and knock people off the ball."
That's what makes this Saturday's game at Bryant-Denny Stadium such a treat for football purists, because Penn State pretty much plays the same way. It even translates down to both teams wearing such simple, yet elegant uniforms -- many believe the best in college football.
"We have a circle around Penn State just because of the standard of excellence they have," junior linebacker Chris Jordan said. "They're going to come out and play hard-nosed football and we like that. We have a standard of excellence ourselves, of being tough to the point of attack, and we're going to just come out and play our type of defense. On offense we're going to go at all cylinders and try and put points on the board.
"They're going to try and hit us in the mouth so we better be ready. That's what we've been preparing for this week, a tough game."

A worker was shot during a robbery in a rare construction site armed robbery in northeast Harris County.
Two men — one armed with a gun and another armed with a knife — robbed four construction employees at around 7:45 a.m. Wednesday as they worked on the planned St. Andrew Ministry Center in the 100 block of Atascocita Road in the Humble area, as first reported by KHOU Ch. 11.
Two young men reportedly approached the worker, demanding his wallet and cellphone. They eventually shot the worker in his arm before fleeing the scene. The victim is in stable condition at an area hospital.
Derek Peake, who has worked in construction for more than 30 years, says it's the first time he's heard of robbers targeting construction workers.
The two suspects stole two cellphones as well as cash from the workers, although nothing else was taken from the construction site.

What progression in the characters' lives does the Before trilogy depict
------------correct----------------------
If anything ramps up in February, it’s a focus on romance with Valentine’s hearts popping up like early crocuses and a focus on high-end movies as the Academy Awards season is in full swing.
With those things percolating around my brain, I’ve been thinking about one of the better films I saw last year, Before Midnight. I was disappointed to see that it didn’t make the Best Picture list, but there you go. (I’ll admit the only BP films I’ve seen so far are Gravity and Philomena, both of which I really enjoyed.)
Anyway, in case you don’t know, Before Midnight is the third film in a series (Before Sunrise and Before Sunset) that follow the relationship of an American man, Jesse (played by Ethan Hawke) and a French woman, Celine (played by Julie Delpy). Each film is set nine years apart, giving a view into the characters in their 20s, 30s, and 40s. Delpy and Hawke helped write the last two, and all were written and directed by Richard Linklater.
Over the course of the several months last year, The Beloved and I watched all three of these films — hardly binge-watching by today’s standards, I suppose. I think they’re very good — arguably the best film trilogy out there (sorry Peter Jackson) and easily the best set of films about relationships around. They can hardly be called action-packed. The entire series revolves around Jesse and Celine walking and talking — about relationships, about themselves, about choices, about life.
In Before Sunrise, Jesse is a 20-something, single American guy who meets Celine on a train to Vienna. Like any 20-something, single, American guy traveling alone in Europe, Jesse tries to get in her pants (or dress, I suppose) and convinces Celine to spend the evening walking around Vienna as he has a plane to catch early the next morning. As they walk, they talk about the “big” things 20-year olds talk about — being true to yourself, never settling, not being like older generations. Jesse’s sort of a douche and she’s got her head in the clouds. They have a perfect night, maybe fall in love, and agree in a moment of bewildering and sleep-deprived romance that rather than exchange information, they’ll return to Vienna in six months if they choose to be together. The audience is left to wonder if they find each other again.
Nine years go by before Before Sunset opens with Jesse — now a successful author in his 30s doing a book signing in Paris. His best-seller is a roman a clef focused on his night in Vienna wi

er Dont'a Hightower said. "I'm not one of those guys who likes to play teams like San Jose State, teams that run a lot of split-draws and reads, that try to confuse you with their eyes and a lot of motion as opposed to teams like Penn State, LSU, Ole Miss, those kinds of teams that go downhill, I-formation, powers, not too much of the fool you around. Just straight up who's gonna win, who's going to break who's will."
Although Penn State senior tailback Evan Royster is coming off a sub-par game with just 40 rushing yards on 11 carries against Youngstown State, he actually has more career yards than Heisman Trophy winner Mark Ingram with 2,958 and needs just 441 to break Curt Warner's school record (FYI, Ingram has 2,386 and Shaun Alexander has the Alabama career record with 3,565).
Meanwhile, Alabama and Penn State were two of just three teams in the nation that didn't allow a 100-yard rusher last season (Ohio State being the other). While the Tide's streak has reached 35 straight games (the last being Ole Miss' BenJarvus Green-Ellis, 131 yards in 2007), Penn State's is up to 17.
"They're a hard-nosed team," said Richardson, who became an even bigger target Tuesday when Sports Illustrated put him on this week's cover after his first career start. "They like getting in a dog fight, they love to come at you. They're going to challenge us, so we need to challenge ourselves in practice every day and be ready for (them).
"That's when you're big time players show. We're going to go toe-to-toe with these boys and see who the bigger man comes out."
But there are two uncharacteristic things about this particular Penn State team, or more specifically young spots. Attracting the most attention last week was Rob Bolden at quarterback and completing 20 of 29 passes for 239 yards and two touchdowns, the best passing performance by a Nittany Lion true freshman starter in program history (although it's a very short list).
"I was skinny, the game was moving 100 miles an hour, but I don't think I was as highly-touted coming out of high school," said senior quarterback Greg McElroy about himself as a freshman. "It's not a sprint, it's a marathon for me. It worked out."
The other is at linebacker, the traditional strength of the Penn State defense where there's three new starters in senior Chris Colasanti, junior Nate Stupar and senior Bani Gbadyu, playing between a physical defensive line and veteran secondary.
"They do a really good job," McElroy said. "They're really well-coached. They do a good job tackling. They're obviously known for their athletic and really talented linebackers. They have some of those. They do a really good job with their coverages. It's not the most difficult defense I've even seen, but they're so sound. I really do a very good job of being in the right place at the right time. It's kind of fun to watch."
It should be for fans on Saturday evening in an old-school type matchup that Jordan believes will be won by the more physical team. Consequently that Fluker-Carpenter tidal wave-type formation might be seen again, both in and out of the wildcat as the Tide hopes to maximize its playmakers.
"Any way they can get me the ball, I'll take it," Julio Jones said.

[Mesa-dev] Mesa (d3d1x): d3d1x: add new Direct3D 10/11 COM state tracker for Gallium

> Since this is derived from code in the DDK, this will prevent me or
The state tracker does not contain code derived from the DDK and
doesn't need any Microsoft code or tools except the Microsoft HLSL
compiler to compile shaders ahead of time (precompiled shaders are
Also, as far as I know, the DDK does not contain any "code"
implementing Direct3D (except possibly examples), but just the headers
normally used by Windows driver developers
Why are you claiming this?
I assume it's because of the comment in tpf.h, which states that it
has been written according to Microsoft's documentation, which is
available solely from reading the d3d11TokenizedProgramFormat.h header
in the DDK.
Using the header, which is documented in the DDK documentation as the
place to look for documentation of the format, as reference, doesn't
seem to me unusual or problematic.
tpf.h is not a derivative work of that header, and it is designed in a
completely different way: the Microsoft header uses accessor macros,
while tpf.h defines structs and unions with bitf

What type of teams does Dont'a Hightower prefer to play against, and why
------------correct----------------------
er Dont'a Hightower said. "I'm not one of those guys who likes to play teams like San Jose State, teams that run a lot of split-draws and reads, that try to confuse you with their eyes and a lot of motion as opposed to teams like Penn State, LSU, Ole Miss, those kinds of teams that go downhill, I-formation, powers, not too much of the fool you around. Just straight up who's gonna win, who's going to break who's will."
Although Penn State senior tailback Evan Royster is coming off a sub-par game with just 40 rushing yards on 11 carries against Youngstown State, he actually has more career yards than Heisman Trophy winner Mark Ingram with 2,958 and needs just 441 to break Curt Warner's school record (FYI, Ingram has 2,386 and Shaun Alexander has the Alabama career record with 3,565).
Meanwhile, Alabama and Penn State were two of just three teams in the nation that didn't allow a 100-yard rusher last season (Ohio State being the other). While the Tide's streak has reached 35 straight games (the last being Ole Miss' BenJarvus Green-Ellis, 131 yards in 2007), Penn State's is up to 17.
"They're a hard-nosed team," said Richardson, who became an even bigger target Tuesday when Sports Illustrated put him on this week's cover after his first career start. "They like getting in a dog fight, they love to come at you. They're going to challenge us, so we need to challenge ourselves in practice every day and be ready for (them).
"That's when you're big time players show. We're going to go toe-to-toe with these boys and see who the bigger man comes out."
But there are two uncharacteristic things about this particular Penn State team, or more specifically young spots. Attracting the most attention last week was Rob Bolden at quarterback and completing 20 of 29 passes for 239 yards and two touchdowns, the best passing performance by a Nittany Lion true freshman starter in program history (although it's a very short list).
"I was skinny, the game was moving 100 miles an hour, but I don't think I was as highly-touted coming out of high school," said senior quarterback Greg McElroy about himself as a freshman. "It's not a sprint, it's a marathon for me. It worked out."
The other is at linebacker, the traditional strength of the Penn State defense where there's three new starters in senior Chris Colasanti, junior Nate Stupar and senior Bani Gbadyu, playing between a physical defensive line and veteran secondary.
"They do a really good job," McElroy said. "They're really well-coached. They do a good job tackling. They're obviously known for their athletic and really talented linebackers. They have some of those. They do a really good job with their coverages. It's not the most difficult defense I've even seen, but they're so sound. I really do a very good job of being in the right place at the right time. It's kind of fun to watch."
It should be for fans on Saturday evening in an old-school type matchup that Jordan believes will be won by the more physical team. Consequently that Fluker-Carpenter tidal wave-type formation might be seen again, both in and out of the wildcat as the Tide hopes to maximize its playmakers.
"Any way they can get me the ball, I'll take it," Julio Jones said.

The Galaxy Class Starship Development Project began in the 2350s at Utopia Planitia Fleet Yards. Numerous technologies implemented on Galaxy-class starships were tested aboard earlier prototype vessels, including the Oberth-class USS Pegasus in the 2350s.
The warp core was designed at Outpost Seran-T-one on stardate 40052 by some of the most brilliant engineering minds in the Federation, including Leah Brahms of the Theoretical Propulsion Group. Major component construction of Galaxy-class ships was carried out both in orbit and at ground based facilities.
Upon its launch, the Galaxy-class had become the most technologically sophisticated and complicated ship ever built by the Federation.
Service aboard a Galaxy-class starship was considered an extremely prestigious assignment and they attracted some of Starfleet's finest officers. Some Galaxy-class ships were able to house large civilian populations; many assigned personnel even brought their families aboard to live with them.
In 2365, the safety of the Galaxy-class, in particular its warp propulsion system, came into question when the USS Yamato was lost in a mysterious accident near the Romulan Neutral Zone. The ship had experienced massive system-wide failures which eventually led to a loss of antimatter containment. Further investigation by the Enterprise-D revealed the malfunctions were the result of an Iconian software transmission and not a design flaw inherent to the ship.
Undoubtedly the most prominent early Galaxy-class starship was the USS Enterprise-D, which, apart from two brief periods under the commands of William T. Riker and Edward Jellico, was commanded for its entire nine years of service by Captain Jean-Luc Picard. The Enterprise-D made First Contact with a multitude of new species, including the Q Continuum, the Ferengi Alliance and the Borg Collective. Its diplomatic efforts helped cool tensions between smaller, regional powers and prevent dramatic upheavals to the security of the Federation during the Klingon Civil War, and frequently checked Romulan and Cardassian operations in tense situations. It fought off some of the Federation's toughest foes, most notably preventing the assimilation of Earth during the Borg invasion of 2367.
The Galaxy-class shared similar design characteristics with the smaller Nebula-class.
The design included two hull sections: a saucer-shaped primary hull, and a detachable secondary hull which housed the ship's primary engines. They could be reversibly separated, and were both equipped with independent flight and combat capabilities. Generally, civilians and non-essential personnel would evacuate to the saucer module, while the senior staff confronted a threat in the battle section, which contained the majority of weapons systems. The saucer was even capable of crash-landing on a planetary surface.
The interior space of the Galaxy-class was left somewhat customizable; areas such as Deck 8 were designated as unfinished and multi-purpose, in the event that extra space was needed for a specific mission. The Enterprise-D was initially launched from Utopia Planitia, a full 35% of the customizable space was left empty, to be later filled with individual modules as seen fit.
The computer system on board the Galaxy-class was isolinear based. Computer systems were concentrated in a computer core, which was accessible through a maintenance room. Each Galaxy-class vessel carried a total of three independent computer cores; two located in the saucer section and one in the engineering section.
Galaxy-class ships achieved warp flight through two warp nacelles, which housed multiple pairs of warp coils. The acceleration delay between slow-reverse impulse and top warp speed, or about warp 9, was 0.300 milliseconds. The maximum speed was warp 9.6, which could be

A Page From The Past by Cindy Davis
Publisher: Champagne Books
Length: Full (270 pages)
Rating: 5 Books
Reviewed by Fennel
The first warning is swift and to the point, but bookstore owners Glenn and Lindsay Reade don’t ‘get it’ until their lives are threatened a second time. All they’ve done is read a young girl’s diary and attempt to locate the owner. Just because the journal describes the girl’s rape and subsequent murder of the rapist is no reason for anyone to want them dead, is it? The book is obviously more than forty years old. Who in the tiny Berkshire town of Paris, Massachusetts could still care?
But someone does. And that someone is willing to kidnap and murder to protect their long buried secret.
In six words Cindy Davis grabs her reader’s attention in a death defying situation. “Our van sailed over the embankment …”
Lindsay Reade tells of how the acquisition of forty year old diary sets off a train of events that start with a bang; the bang of one vehicle hitting another and sending it flying off the road.
Lindsay and her husband Glenn are looking forward to going through their latest haul of second-hand books

l be a deciding factor, too. But why would Zynga hold such an event all about one of its least popular games?
Since its release earlier this summer, Pioneer Trail has been in decline, according to AppData. That's despite some hefty updates pushed to the game like the massive Ghost Town. Our guess is that Zynga is looking for answers as to why what was once one of its most popular games has lost its luster after what was supposed to be its revival. Check out the forum post here for all the details.
Why do you think Zynga is holding such a Pioneer Trail conference? Do you plan on applying to get a seat? Sound off in the comments. Add Comment.

What incident involving construction workers did Derek Peake describe
------------correct----------------------
nt Derek Peake, who has worked in construction for more than 30 years, tells KPRC Ch. 2 that this is the first time he's heard of robbers targeting construction workers.
"I was inside the trailer and I heard four small pops and thought, 'That sounds odd,' " Peake says. "My foreman came in and said, 'Call the police, call the ambulance quick.'
"(The workers) said one guy had a small pistol and one had a knife, and (the robbers) came up and started hollering and cursing, 'Give us all your money.' Before (the workers) had a chance to do anything, (the robbers) grabbed the cellphone — I guess from one of the guys. They shot four times and only hit the one guy in the arm. One of the guys hollered, 'Police' and that scared (the robbers) and they took off."
Police say they are looking for two males, 18- to 20-years-old, dressed in dark clothing and last seen running from the site

Why did the Finnish government refuse Israel's request to purchase arms

LONDON (Dec. 30)
Israel tried and failed to purchase arms from Finland, the Times of London reported here today from Helsinki.

It does not seem to me that this code is more similar to Microsoft
headers than the existing code in Wine.
Also, unlike the Wine d3d10 implementation, this implementation only
cares about the documented API and doesn't attempt to implement
internal APIs as the Wine implementation appears to do, and hence
seems better in that regard.
> To the extent that my contributions matter
Your contributions would be greatly welcome and appreciated, both to
r600g and to this code, especially since you are one of the authors of
the existing D3D10 code in Wine.
I don't think there are serious concerns affecting that, and if there
were they could just be fixed.

What advancements led to the technological complexity of the Galaxy-class starship
------------correct----------------------
The Galaxy Class Starship Development Project began in the 2350s at Utopia Planitia Fleet Yards. Numerous technologies implemented on Galaxy-class starships were tested aboard earlier prototype vessels, including the Oberth-class USS Pegasus in the 2350s.
The warp core was designed at Outpost Seran-T-one on stardate 40052 by some of the most brilliant engineering minds in the Federation, including Leah Brahms of the Theoretical Propulsion Group. Major component construction of Galaxy-class ships was carried out both in orbit and at ground based facilities.
Upon its launch, the Galaxy-class had become the most technologically sophisticated and complicated ship ever built by the Federation.
Service aboard a Galaxy-class starship was considered an extremely prestigious assignment and they attracted some of Starfleet's finest officers. Some Galaxy-class ships were able to house large civilian populations; many assigned personnel even brought their families aboard to live with them.
In 2365, the safety of the Galaxy-class, in particular its warp propulsion system, came into question when the USS Yamato was lost in a mysterious accident near the Romulan Neutral Zone. The ship had experienced massive system-wide failures which eventually led to a loss of antimatter containment. Further investigation by the Enterprise-D revealed the malfunctions were the result of an Iconian software transmission and not a design flaw inherent to the ship.
Undoubtedly the most prominent early Galaxy-class starship was the USS Enterprise-D, which, apart from two brief periods under the commands of William T. Riker and Edward Jellico, was commanded for its entire nine years of service by Captain Jean-Luc Picard. The Enterprise-D made First Contact with a multitude of new species, including the Q Continuum, the Ferengi Alliance and the Borg Collective. Its diplomatic efforts helped cool tensions between smaller, regional powers and prevent dramatic upheavals to the security of the Federation during the Klingon Civil War, and frequently checked Romulan and Cardassian operations in tense situations. It fought off some of the Federation's toughest foes, most notably preventing the assimilation of Earth during the Borg invasion of 2367.
The Galaxy-class shared similar design characteristics with the smaller Nebula-class.
The design included two hull sections: a saucer-shaped primary hull, and a detachable secondary hull which housed the ship's primary engines. They could be reversibly separated, and were both equipped with independent flight and combat capabilities. Generally, civilians and non-essential personnel would evacuate to the saucer module, while the senior staff confronted a threat in the battle section, which contained the majority of weapons systems. The saucer was even capable of crash-landing on a planetary surface.
The interior space of the Galaxy-class was left somewhat customizable; areas such as Deck 8 were designated as unfinished and multi-purpose, in the event that extra space was needed for a specific mission. The Enterprise-D was initially launched from Utopia Planitia, a full 35% of the customizable space was left empty, to be later filled with individual modules as seen fit.
The computer system on board the Galaxy-class was isolinear based. Computer systems were concentrated in a computer core, which was accessible through a maintenance room. Each Galaxy-class vessel carried a total of three independent computer cores; two located in the saucer section and one in the engineering section.
Galaxy-class ships achieved warp flight through two warp nacelles, which housed multiple pairs of warp coils. The acceleration delay between slow-reverse impulse and top warp speed, or about warp 9, was 0.300 milliseconds. The maximum speed was warp 9.6, which could be

Major component construction of Galaxy-class ships was carried out both in orbit and at ground based facilities.
Upon its launch, the Galaxy-class had become the most technologically sophisticated and complicated ship ever built by the Federation.
Service aboard a Galaxy-class starship was considered an extremely prestigious assignment and they attracted some of Starfleet's finest officers. Some Galaxy-class ships were able to house large civilian populations; many assigned personnel even brought their families aboard to live with them.
In 2365, the safety of the Galaxy-class, in particular its warp propulsion system, came into question when the USS Yamato was lost in a mysterious accident near the Romulan Neutral Zone. The ship had experienced massive system-wide failures which eventually led to a loss of antimatter containment. Further investigation by the Enterprise-D revealed the malfunctions were the result of an Iconian software transmission and not a design flaw inherent to the ship.
Undoubtedly the most prominent early Galaxy-class starship was the USS Enterprise-D, which, apart from two brief periods under the commands of William T. Riker and Edward Jellico, was commanded for its entire nine years of service by Captain Jean-Luc Picard. The Enterprise-D made First Contact with a multitude of new species, including the Q Continuum, the Ferengi Alliance and the Borg Collective. Its diplomatic efforts helped cool tensions between smaller, regional powers and prevent dramatic upheavals to the security of the Federation during the Klingon Civil War, and frequently checked Romulan and Cardassian operations in tense situations. It fought off some of the Federation's toughest foes, most notably preventing the assimilation of Earth during the Borg invasion of 2367.
The Galaxy-class shared similar design characteristics with the smaller Nebula-class.
The design included two hull sections: a saucer-shaped primary hull, and a detachable secondary hull which housed the ship's primary engines. They could be reversibly separated, and were both equipped with independent flight and combat capabilities. Generally, civilians and non-essential personnel would evacuate to the saucer module, while the senior staff confronted a threat in the battle section, which contained the majority of weapons systems. The saucer was even capable of crash-landing on a planetary surface.
The interior space of the Galaxy-class was left somewhat customizable; areas such as Deck 8 were designated as unfinished and multi-purpose, in the event that extra space was needed for a specific mission. The Enterprise-D was initially launched from Utopia Planitia, a full 35% of the customizable space was left empty, to be later filled with individual modules as seen fit.
The computer system on board the Galaxy-class was isolinear based. Computer systems were concentrated in a computer core, which was accessible through a maintenance room. Each Galaxy-class vessel carried a total of three independent computer cores; two located in the saucer section and one in the engineering section.
Galaxy-class ships achieved warp flight through two warp nacelles, which housed multiple pairs of warp coils. The acceleration delay between slow-reverse impulse and top warp speed, or about warp 9, was 0.300 milliseconds. The maximum speed was warp 9.6, which could be

maintained for approximately twelve hours. The warp core was one of the most powerful in Starfleet, generating approximately 12.75 billion gigawatts of power. The efficiency of the warp drive could be tweaked to a point where it rivaled the new Intrepid-class ships introduced in 2370.
The warp core spanned twelve decks in the engineering hull. The deuterium tanks were above the core, while antimatter storage pods surrounded the base of the core on Deck 42.
There were three impulse engines, two on the saucer section and one in the stardrive section. In early ships, only the impulse engine in the stardrive section was usually active.
Galaxy-class ships supported a wide variety of scientific equipment and laboratories studying many different disciplines. In addition to sensors, Galaxy-class ships were equipped with a variety of probes and scientific devices that could be launched from the torpedo launchers.
The Galaxy-class was equipped with ten phaser banks, distributed in phaser arrays at various points along both hulls. One array was located on the dorsal of the battle section and could only be used following a separation. There were also fore and aft torpedo launchers on the engineering section. Each launch tube was capable of firing at least five photon torpedoes simultaneously, each torpedo capable of being independently targeted. In the 2360s, Galaxy-class ships typically carried about 250 photon torpedoes. The torpedo launchers were also capable of launching probes. The Galaxy-class also carried antimatter mines and supported a high-capacity deflector shield grid.
The main bridge of the Galaxy-class was located on Deck 1 of the saucer section. As with most starships, the main bridge was modular and could be completely replaced with another bridge if the need called for it. Different Galaxy-class starships had different bridge designs.
The forward bulkhead was dominated by the main viewscreen. Directly aft of this were the operations officer and conn positions. At the very center of the room was the command area – the captain's chair at the center, flanked by chairs for the first officer to the right, and an additional officer (typically the ship's counselor or chief medical officer) to the left. Smaller backless seats were located on the edges of the command area, for other officers to sit, should the need arise.
The tactical console, positioned directly behind the captain, was located in the wooden handrail that encircled the rear half of the central command area. The aft bulkhead carried several additional consoles.
By necessity, the bridge had easy access to and from all other important areas of the ship. In all, there were six doors leading from the room. Moving clockwise from the main viewscreen, the first door, level with, and to the right of the conn, led directly to the battle bridge emergency turbolift. At the rear right of the bridge, a shallow alcove contained two doors, one of which led to a head, the other to a corridor leading to the observation lounge. The door at the rear left of the room opened onto a standard turbolift. Continuing around, the fifth door led into the captain's ready room, the sixth to another turbolift.

How have Celine and Jesse changed over the years as depicted in the films
------------correct----------------------
th Celine. Celine arrives and it’s clear that they didn’t reunite eight and a half years ago. Again, they walk and talk – this time before his flight leaves at sunset. The changes in them are remarkable. They’ve shed much of their 20-something idealism for pragmatism. Jesse’s less douchey. Celine works for the environment. They talk about their lives and their dissatisfactions — he’s unhappily married with a son, she’s never settled down. Grown up stuff. But the night in Vienna is still there in their minds and the film ebbs and flows around the idea of The One That Got Away — a concept you can’t really think about until your 30s. Their future is again left ambiguous.
Another almost-decade rolls by and Celine and Jesse are together in Before Midnight. They are vacationing in Greece and friends there give them a “night off” from their kids (who look to be about 8, if you’re doing the math). As you might guess, Celine and Jesse walk and talk to the hotel. There is less energy. They’re obviously working to make the evening “fun”, but the night in Vienna and an afternoon in Paris seem a long way away. They’re consumed with career decisions, life choices, and the “compromises” they’ve made for one another. Instead of snappy banter, they’re snappish. Are they happy? Is this what true commitment looks like? Is real romance only momentary? And then there’s the hotel room. As with the other films, the viewer is once again asked “Will they be together afterwards?”, but this time the overhanging question is “Should they?”
I think these films are a remarkable achievement by Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy. They’ve created characters, not caricatures, and allowed them to age and change. At times over the course of the three films you find yourself liking and disliking both Jesse and Celine — rooting for them, and occasionally against them. Though I’m older now than Jesse and Celine in Before Midnight, I can remember being a 20-something walking the streets of Vienna with a girl. I can remember creating idylls of The One That Got Away in my 30s. I can remember seeing the writing on the wall in hotel rooms.
The unusual thing about this series is that I think each one is better than the one before it. Maybe that makes me happy because I think each of my decades has been better than the one before it.
Will we see Jesse and Celine again in their late 40s/early 50s? I guess we’ll have to wait until 2022. Until then, we can walk and talk about them.

What did The Times say might be a condition for clearer understanding of human and political problems in the region
------------correct----------------------
only when arms ceased to pour into the region “will the dust begin to clear away and the real human and political problems be seen in a clearer light.” The Times noted that an arms ban need not involve any Middle Eastern country in negotiations, yet would provide a “sharp test of Soviet sincerity.”
Asserting that “patience and goodwill” will not solve the problems of the region, the Times said that “Israel cannot be wished away by the Arabs or by anyone else.” It suggested that even if the Arab-Israel conflict were ended all insecurity and instability in the Middle East would not be ended

What incident occurred at a construction site in northeast Harris County on Wednesday morning
------------correct----------------------
A worker was shot during a robbery in a rare construction site armed robbery in northeast Harris County.
Two men — one armed with a gun and another armed with a knife — robbed four construction employees at around 7:45 a.m. Wednesday as they worked on the planned St. Andrew Ministry Center in the 100 block of Atascocita Road in the Humble area, as first reported by KHOU Ch. 11.
Two young men reportedly approached the worker, demanding his wallet and cellphone. They eventually shot the worker in his arm before fleeing the scene. The victim is in stable condition at an area hospital.
Derek Peake, who has worked in construction for more than 30 years, says it's the first time he's heard of robbers targeting construction workers.
The two suspects stole two cellphones as well as cash from the workers, although nothing else was taken from the construction site.

What issue is described related to typing passwords and what potential solutions or explanations are mentioned
------------correct----------------------
s an annoying issue where you are
prompted to type your password every time you do anything). If you are
using bodhi 0.9, I'm not sure how it does authentication but I think it
might also be the same OpenID code.
Were you prompted for a password?
It seems that the error message really meant "the service is down",
because it works as of this morning.

Scandinavian style with lots of atmosphere and some color. We found the webshop PIB home for our table.
A really beautiful webshop with a few gems in between. Our side-table Victor is beautifully made. You really see the craftmanship. The table is made of acacia wood with a beautiful fabric pouf.
If you are looking for a nice product for your interior yourself, take a look at PIB home. They have a broad collection and everything is of high quality. We will definitely look again for a nice product from PIB. One of our other favorites is this beautiful wine bottle cabinet! I’m in love.

A mother whose baby girl was forcibly delivered by caesarean section and put up for adoption was denied the chance to spend even the first few days of her child’s life with her, it has emerged.
Doctors recommended allowing the woman, who cannot be named, to have her child with her in hospital while arrangements were made for the future but were turned down by a court which met behind closed doors.
The child, who cannot be named, was taken from her mother’s womb under a court order because of safety fears because of her mother’s mental state.
The mother, who is an Italian citizen, suffers from a bipolar condition but has, according to a recent court hearing, recently turned her life around and is now fighting an impassioned campaign to halt the adoption and have her child returned to her.
She was sent back to her native Italy after care proceedings got under way but made clear last night that she is still fighting to get her daughter back.
It also emerged last night that Britain’s most senior family judge, Sir James Munby, the President of the High Court Family Division, has personally intervened to take over the case.
The incident has thrown the spotlight on activities of the Court of Protection, the branch of the High Court with powers to make life and death decisions about vulnerable people in private and send people to prison in secret for breaching its orders. MPs have also voiced alarm at the issues exposed by the case.
It is understood that the mother had a history of “manic episodes” dating back several years and had been in and out of hospitals.
She was pregnant when she came to Britain on a short visit in June of last year but her condition deteriorated after a panic attack and she was sectioned under the Mental Health Act.
In August the local health trust secured an order from the Court of Protection for an order to have her child delivered under caesarean section citing “risks to mother and child”.
Although she was allowed to see her baby on the day of the birth and again on the following day, social workers from Essex County Council immediately applied for an order to have the child tak

------------question-----------------------
What features does the Galaxy-class starship's warp core have and how does it compare to newer ship classes introduced in 2370
------------correct----------------------
maintained for approximately twelve hours. The warp core was one of the most powerful in Starfleet, generating approximately 12.75 billion gigawatts of power. The efficiency of the warp drive could be tweaked to a point where it rivaled the new Intrepid-class ships introduced in 2370.
The warp core spanned twelve decks in the engineering hull. The deuterium tanks were above the core, while antimatter storage pods surrounded the base of the core on Deck 42.
There were three impulse engines, two on the saucer section and one in the stardrive section. In early ships, only the impulse engine in the stardrive section was usually active.
Galaxy-class ships supported a wide variety of scientific equipment and laboratories studying many different disciplines. In addition to sensors, Galaxy-class ships were equipped with a variety of probes and scientific devices that could be launched from the torpedo launchers.
The Galaxy-class was equipped with ten phaser banks, distributed in phaser arrays at various points along both hulls. One array was located on the dorsal of the battle section and could only be used following a separation. There were also fore and aft torpedo launchers on the engineering section. Each launch tube was capable of firing at least five photon torpedoes simultaneously, each torpedo capable of being independently targeted. In the 2360s, Galaxy-class ships typically carried about 250 photon torpedoes. The torpedo launchers were also capable of launching probes. The Galaxy-class also carried antimatter mines and supported a high-capacity deflector shield grid.
The main bridge of the Galaxy-class was located on Deck 1 of the saucer section. As with most starships, the main bridge was modular and could be completely replaced with another bridge if the need called for it. Different Galaxy-class starships had different bridge designs.
The forward bulkhead was dominated by the main viewscreen. Directly aft of this were the operations officer and conn positions. At the very center of the room was the command area – the captain's chair at the center, flanked by chairs for the first officer to the right, and an additional officer (typically the ship's counselor or chief medical officer) to the left. Smaller backless seats were located on the edges of the command area, for other officers to sit, should the need arise.
The tactical console, positioned directly behind the captain, was located in the wooden handrail that encircled the rear half of the central command area. The aft bulkhead carried several additional consoles.
By necessity, the bridge had easy access to and from all other important areas of the ship. In all, there were six doors leading from the room. Moving clockwise from the main viewscreen, the first door, level with, and to the right of the conn, led directly to the battle bridge emergency turbolift. At the rear right of the bridge, a shallow alcove contained two doors, one of which led to a head, the other to a corridor leading to the observation lounge. The door at the rear left of the room opened onto a standard turbolift. Continuing around, the fifth door led into the captain's ready room, the sixth to another turbolift.

th Celine. Celine arrives and it’s clear that they didn’t reunite eight and a half years ago. Again, they walk and talk – this time before his flight leaves at sunset. The changes in them are remarkable. They’ve shed much of their 20-something idealism for pragmatism. Jesse’s less douchey. Celine works for the environment. They talk about their lives and their dissatisfactions — he’s unhappily married with a son, she’s never settled down. Grown up stuff. But the night in Vienna is still there in their minds and the film ebbs and flows around the idea of The One That Got Away — a concept you can’t really think about until your 30s. Their future is again left ambiguous.
Another almost-decade rolls by and Celine and Jesse are together in Before Midnight. They are vacationing in Greece and friends there give them a “night off” from their kids (who look to be about 8, if you’re doing the math). As you might guess, Celine and Jesse walk and talk to the hotel. There is less energy. They’re obviously working to make the evening “fun”, but the night in Vienna and an afternoon in Paris seem a long way away. They’re consumed with career decisions, life choices, and the “compromises” they’ve made for one another. Instead of snappy banter, they’re snappish. Are they happy? Is this what true commitment looks like? Is real romance only momentary? And then there’s the hotel room. As with the other films, the viewer is once again asked “Will they be together afterwards?”, but this time the overhanging question is “Should they?”
I think these films are a remarkable achievement by Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy. They’ve created characters, not caricatures, and allowed them to age and change. At times over the course of the three films you find yourself liking and disliking both Jesse and Celine — rooting for them, and occasionally against them. Though I’m older now than Jesse and Celine in Before Midnight, I can remember being a 20-something walking the streets of Vienna with a girl. I can remember creating idylls of The One That Got Away in my 30s. I can remember seeing the writing on the wall in hotel rooms.
The unusual thing about this series is that I think each one is better than the one before it. Maybe that makes me happy because I think each of my decades has been better than the one before it.
Will we see Jesse and Celine again in their late 40s/early 50s? I guess we’ll have to wait until 2022. Until then, we can walk and talk about them.

The first warning is swift and to the point, but bookstore owners Glenn and Lindsay Reade don’t ‘get it’ until their lives are threatened a second time. All they’ve done is read a young girl’s diary and attempt to locate the owner. Just because the journal describes the girl’s rape and subsequent murder of the rapist is no reason for anyone to want them dead, is it? The book is obviously more than forty years old. Who in the tiny Berkshire town of Paris, Massachusetts could still care?

TUSCALOOSA _ Just the mere mention brings a wide-eye look to the face of University of Alabama sophomore running back Trent Richardson.
The Crimson Tide initially showed it against San Jose State, on the wildcat end-around carry by wide receiver Julio Jones, who turned it into a 13-yard gain. The primary blockers in front of him, lined up next to one another on the left side were massive tackles James Carpenter and D.J. Fluker.
On Tuesday that combination went to another level when during the observation period of practice Carpenter lined up outside of Fluker on the right side where a tight end might normally be. Apparently the idea isn't just a mere flash on the formation radar, but something every opponent will have to prepare for.
"You got some big boys to run behind and they're taking care of you," Richardson said. "I'm not scared of anything when I run behind them, not at all."
While it'll be a hit with fans, and figures to be this year's equivalent to putting nose tackle Terrence Cody in the backfield near the goal-line, when it comes to Alabama that's about it in terms of unorthodox play-calling. Granted, the Crimson Tide will try a trick play every once in a while, especially if the coaches notice something on film, but otherwise the closest thing to being untraditional in Tuscaloosa is probably the pistol formation or someone other than the quarterback taking a snap.
"The wildcat package is something that a lot of teams are preparing for more," sophomore guard Barrett Jones said. "They kind of recognize it and call things for it more, but that's fine with us. Everyone's seen the wildcat.
"It is something we definitely want to do, but we also just want to line up and knock people off the ball."
That's what makes this Saturday's game at Bryant-Denny Stadium such a treat for football purists, because Penn State pretty much plays the same way. It even translates down to both teams wearing such simple, yet elegant uniforms -- many believe the best in college football.
"We have a circle around Penn State just because of the standard of excellence they have," junior linebacker Chris Jordan said. "They're going to come out and play hard-nosed football and we like that. We have a standard of excellence ourselves, of being tough to the point of attack, and we're going to just come out and play our type of defense. On offense we're going to go at all cylinders and try and put points on the board.
"They're going to try and hit us in the mouth so we better be ready. That's what we've been preparing for this week, a tough game."
Ironically, it comes immediately after the most difficult opponent in terms of preparation, San Jose State. New head coach Mike McIntyre was previously the defensive coordinator at Duke, defensive coordinator Kent Baer last held that position at Washington (2005-07) and no one knew for sure what kind of offense the Spartans would execute. Consequently, Alabama spent time preparing for things it never saw in the game.
This is the exact opposite. With Joe Paterno in his 45th year as head coach, and 61st year at Penn State, the Nittany Lions are pretty much a what-you-see-is-what-you-get team.
"I'm really looking forward to it," sophomore lineback

nt Derek Peake, who has worked in construction for more than 30 years, tells KPRC Ch. 2 that this is the first time he's heard of robbers targeting construction workers.
"I was inside the trailer and I heard four small pops and thought, 'That sounds odd,' " Peake says. "My foreman came in and said, 'Call the police, call the ambulance quick.'
"(The workers) said one guy had a small pistol and one had a knife, and (the robbers) came up and started hollering and cursing, 'Give us all your money.' Before (the workers) had a chance to do anything, (the robbers) grabbed the cellphone — I guess from one of the guys. They shot four times and only hit the one guy in the arm. One of the guys hollered, 'Police' and that scared (the robbers) and they took off."
Police say they are looking for two males, 18- to 20-years-old, dressed in dark clothing and last seen running from the site

If anything ramps up in February, it’s a focus on romance with Valentine’s hearts popping up like early crocuses and a focus on high-end movies as the Academy Awards season is in full swing.
With those things percolating around my brain, I’ve been thinking about one of the better films I saw last year, Before Midnight. I was disappointed to see that it didn’t make the Best Picture list, but there you go. (I’ll admit the only BP films I’ve seen so far are Gravity and Philomena, both of which I really enjoyed.)
Anyway, in case you don’t know, Before Midnight is the third film in a series (Before Sunrise and Before Sunset) that follow the relationship of an American man, Jesse (played by Ethan Hawke) and a French woman, Celine (played by Julie Delpy). Each film is set nine years apart, giving a view into the characters in their 20s, 30s, and 40s. Delpy and Hawke helped write the last two, and all were written and directed by Richard Linklater.
Over the course of the several months last year, The Beloved and I watched all three of these films — hardly binge-watching by today’s standards, I suppose. I think they’re very good — arguably the best film trilogy out there (sorry Peter Jackson) and easily the best set of films about relationships around. They can hardly be called action-packed. The entire series revolves around Jesse and Celine walking and talking — about relationships, about themselves, about choices, about life.
In Before Sunrise, Jesse is a 20-something, single American guy who meets Celine on a train to Vienna. Like any 20-something, single, American guy traveling alone in Europe, Jesse tries to get in her pants (or dress, I suppose) and convinces Celine to spend the evening walking around Vienna as he has a plane to catch early the next morning. As they walk, they talk about the “big” things 20-year olds talk about — being true to yourself, never settling, not being like older generations. Jesse’s sort of a douche and she’s got her head in the clouds. They have a perfect night, maybe fall in love, and agree in a moment of bewildering and sleep-deprived romance that rather than exchange information, they’ll return to Vienna in six months if they choose to be together. The audience is left to wonder if they find each other again.
Nine years go by before Before Sunset opens with Jesse — now a successful author in his 30s doing a book signing in Paris. His best-seller is a roman a clef focused on his night in Vienna wi

------------correct----------------------
l be a deciding factor, too. But why would Zynga hold such an event all about one of its least popular games?
Since its release earlier this summer, Pioneer Trail has been in decline, according to AppData. That's despite some hefty updates pushed to the game like the massive Ghost Town. Our guess is that Zynga is looking for answers as to why what was once one of its most popular games has lost its luster after what was supposed to be its revival. Check out the forum post here for all the details.
