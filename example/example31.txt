Alan Lloyd Hodgkin Biography (1914-1998)
Alan Lloyd Hodgkin was best known for his work in defining the electrical andchemical characteristics of nerve impulses. Along with Andrew F. Huxley he performed experiments on the nerve fibers of squid and described the nerve impulses with a series of mathematical equations. For their research in this area, which resulted in the ionic theory of nerve impulses , the two menshared the 1963 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine with John C. Eccles.
Hodgkin was born on February 5, 1914, in Banbury, Oxfordshire, England, to George L. and Mary Wilson Hodgkin. Hodgkin's father died in Baghdad during World War I, only a few years after his birth. Hodgkin was educated at the DownsSchool in Malvern and the Gresham School in Holt. In 1932, he entered TrinityCollege, Cambridge, where he first became interested in physiology. Hodgkinbecame a fellow at Trinity in 1936, serving as lecturer and later as assistant director of research at the physiological laboratory.
Hodgkin began studying the electrical properties of the nerve fibers in the shore crab while at Cambridge. He spent a year at the Rockefeller Institute inNew York City between 1937 and 1938, and while there he met scientists who had developed new methods for studying nerve fibers. Hodgkin brought these ideas back to Cambridge, where with Andrew Huxley he devised an experiment to test an hypothesis about nerve impulses first proposed by German physiologist Julius Bernstein .
Bernstein had hypothesized that nerve cells possess a resting or unstimulatedpotential and an action or stimulated potential. During the resting potential, he believed, the nerve cell membrane had an unequal distribution of positively and negatively charged ions, with more negative ones on the inside. During resting potential, the membrane was permeable to the positively charged ions, but the negatively charged ions could not permeate the cell membrane. When the cell was stimulated, Bernstein argued, the membrane "gates" were temporarily opened, allowing ions to pass in both directions. By using the nerve cells of the shore crab, Hodgkin was able to establish that the resting potential was due to an outward movement of potassium ions; during the action potential the cell membrane's gates allowed in the more concentrated sodium ions. He also discovered that the action potential was usually much larger than theresting potential.
Some of the researchers Hodgkin had met in the United States were working with squid, wh

Editorial for March 2021 edition of NetworkNature Newsletter.
Environmental degradation impacts on the well-being of an estimated 3.2 billion people globally whilst the loss of ecosystem services leads to a reduction of more than 10% of our global economic output (UNEP, 2021). A total of 33% of marine fish stocks are overfished and around one-thirds of the world’s farmland is degraded. Trends of ecosystem degradation have also been recorded for ecosystems at regional scale, with a recent EU-wide assessment concluding that the current potential of ecosystems to deliver timber, protection against floods, crop pollination, and nature-based recreation is equal to or lower than the baseline value for 2010.
The impact on biodiversity is equally upsetting. An estimated 32 million hectares of primary and recovering forest were lost between 2010 and 2015, and approximately half the live coral cover on coral reefs has been lost since the 1870s, as indicated by the IPBES Global Assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Around 40% of all the world’s species live and breed in wetlands but the world has lost 87% of its wetlands since 1700. One out of four mammal species and an estimated 41% of the amphibians are threatened with extinction and whilst globally only a small proportion of the insect species have been evaluated, local declines of pollinator species have been recorded.
Most of us would readily accept the notion that nature is essential for human existence and good quality of life, but in using and extracting resources from the environment we have damaged its ability to sustain human communities, with benefits and burdens being disproportionately shared and experienced differently among social groups, countries, and regions.
The degradation and destruction of natural capital needs to be turned around by an equal, positive, wave of responses that transform society through short and long-term actions that drive a green recovery. In this regard, the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration 2021-2030 represents a distinct opportunity to collaborate and make meaningful headway in preventing, halting, and reversing the degradation of our planet’s ecosystems.
Action is also seen at regional and national levels, with the EU planning to propose legally binding nature restoration targets as part of its Biodiversity Strategy for 2030. The strategy calls for a stronger implementation of restoratio

------------question-----------------------
What significant contribution did Hodgkin and Huxley make to the study of nerve fibers in 1952
------------correct----------------------
ose nerve fibers are larger than those of most organisms. Hodgkinand Huxley were able to develop a method to study these fibers using microelectrodes, and they were able to confirm the results of their earlier experiment. Their progress, however, came to a halt during World War II, when Hodgkinworked on radar systems for aircraft for the Air Ministry. Hodgkin and Huxleywere back in Cambridge in 1945, and they formed a small research group to pursue their pre-war investigations into nerve fibers.
In 1951, Hodgkin and his colleagues published the results of their research.They found that the membrane is permeable only to specific ions during the resting potential, because of the differing concentrations of potassium and sodium. The concentration of the positively charged sodium ions is greater on the outside of the membrane and the concentration of negative potassium ions higher on the inside during resting potential. During the action potential, thenegative and positive ions travel through the membrane, so that the interiorcharge becomes positive and the exterior negative. This is followed by an equilibrium charge, then a return to the resting potential charge state. All this happens in milliseconds.
The work done by Hodgkin and Huxley which was most responsible for bringing them to the attention of the Nobel Prize committee was the development of a series of mathematical formulae they published in 1952. The purpose of these equations was to synthesize the experimental information then available about the electrical and chemical nature of nerve transmissions. Their goal was to analyze and predict each stage in the passage of the nerve cell membrane fromresting to action potential. They were awarded the 1963 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine, which they shared with John C. Eccles, an Australian who advanced the British team's findings by showing what happens to nerve impulsestransmitted across the synapses, or intersections, between nerve cells.
Hodgkin was appointed Foulerton Research Professor of the Royal Society in 1952, and was awarded the Royal Medal in 1958. He was John Humphrey Plummer Professor of Biophysics at Cambridge from 1970 to 1981, president of the MarineBiological Association from 1966 to 1976, and a master of Trinity College.
Hodgkin was married in 1944 to Marion Rous, the daughter of American Nobel Laureate Peyton Rous. The couple met during Hodgkin's year at the Rockefeller Institute in New York. They had four children Hodgkin died December 20,1998

This is followed by an equilibrium charge, then a return to the resting potential charge state. All this happens in milliseconds.
The work done by Hodgkin and Huxley which was most responsible for bringing them to the attention of the Nobel Prize committee was the development of a series of mathematical formulae they published in 1952. The purpose of these equations was to synthesize the experimental information then available about the electrical and chemical nature of nerve transmissions. Their goal was to analyze and predict each stage in the passage of the nerve cell membrane fromresting to action potential. They were awarded the 1963 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine, which they shared with John C. Eccles, an Australian who advanced the British team's findings by showing what happens to nerve impulsestransmitted across the synapses, or intersections, between nerve cells.
Hodgkin was appointed Foulerton Research Professor of the Royal Society in 1952, and was awarded the Royal Medal in 1958. He was John Humphrey Plummer Professor of Biophysics at Cambridge from 1970 to 1981, president of the MarineBiological Association from 1966 to 1976, and a master of Trinity College.
Hodgkin was married in 1944 to Marion Rous, the daughter of American Nobel Laureate Peyton Rous. The couple met during Hodgkin's year at the Rockefeller Institute in New York. They had four children Hodgkin died December 20,1998

Paramount is either A) saying not to expect much here, lowering expectations or B) counter-programming against “prestige” pictures with a little lowdown lady-powered comedy that could make some noise.

------------question-----------------------
What significant historical photographs contributed to the Desert House's fame before it was sold for $25 million
------------correct----------------------
nto Mountains as its background, the Desert House was one of Palm Springs’ earliest modern-style homes that has now grown to the largest collection in the U.S. including John Lautner’s Hope Residence for Bob and Dolores Hope and his Elrod House as seen in the James Bond flick Diamonds Are Forever, Frank Sinatra’s Twin Palms, the Elvis Presley honeymoon home, and the Dinah Shore Estate that is now owned by Leonardo DiCaprio.
The five-bedroom Desert House became a celebrity only a year after its completion when architectural- photographer Julius Schulman created a black-and-white photograph of the house, which gave it international attention and praise. Over twenty years later, society-photographer Slim Aarons’ photo “Poolside Gossip” of two women talking by the home’s pool has become a classic as popular today as when it was taken. Constructed of steel, glass and stone on an open floor plan, almost all Desert House rooms open to attractive outdoor scenery. The living room has a floor-to-ceiling stone fireplace and the entertainment lounge has a bar and is also open to the outdoors, all in California style with vanishing thresholds between indoor and outdoor living space. In addition to a desert garden, the back opens to emerald green grass and plantings surrounding the large pool terrace with stunning mountain views, all sited on over two acres.
The Kaufmann Desert House, having undergone a five-year restoration by Marmol Radziner, is now for sale at $25 million. It is listed by Gerard Bisignano, a partner at Vista Sotheby’s International Realty, Palos Verdes Estates.

------------question-----------------------
What are some benefits of having a living wall besides aesthetics
------------correct----------------------
Living walls, or vertical gardens, are the latest great design craze and have been popping up all over the place. While they are increasingly popular in businesses and public areas, these living works of art are also especially handy for people living in small spaces where space for plants is limited. Though they look gorgeous, aesthetics aren’t the only reason for putting up one of these babies: having plenty of green plants around can also reduce stress, increase wellbeing, purify and humidify the air, and dampen noise pollution! Getting a living wall professionally designed and installed can cost a fortune… luckily, this DIY version is quick, easy, and cheap!
The Difficulty: Medium – you need to be familiar with some basic tools, and a considerable amount of strength is needed when things get heavy
The Time Commitment: Done in a day
The Look: Rustic and chunky, modern and on-trend
The Cost: Less than $100 (you’ll spend the most on plants)
Would I do it Again? Absolutely.
What you’ll need:
- Shipping Pallet (we got ours on the side of the road, outside a warehouse)
- Thin wood or plastic roughly the size of the back of the pallet
- Landscaping fabric
- Plastic sheeting
- Staple gun
- Indoor potting soil
- 3inch eyehooks
- Heavy weight bearing metal chain
Remove the slats from the top of the pallet. This can be a little tricky, but patience and creativity will get you there!
Cover the back of the pallet with the thin piece of wood, and nail into place. Then, cover the entire back of the pallet with the plastic sheeting and use the staple gun to secure. This will protect your walls from moisture!

How much money was raised for the Cape Cod Chapter of Big Brothers Big Sisters during the National Margarita Day celebration
------------correct----------------------
The local business community, with the help of hundreds of Cape Codders, turned National Margarita Day into a BIG win for the Cape Cod Chapter of Big Brothers Big Sisters!
On Thursday, February 22, the community raised $4,000 for the non-profit organization during the National Margarita Day celebration at GUAPO’s Orleans. Nauset Disposal, Cape Cod Broadcasting and Bayside Tent co-hosted the fundraiser, helping reach the 4K tally.
The annual fundraiser featured a festive party where revelers enjoyed a heated tent, margarita samples, food stations and a boomerang photo booth in exchange for a donation to Big Brothers Big Sisters. Additional funds were raised through the annual Blizzard Barrel giveaway. Party goers purchased chances to win the 95-gallon Nauset Disposal barrel, which was filled with products, gift cards, sports tickets and more donated by local businesses….a total of more than $2,000 in prizes! More than 40 local businesses contributed to the prize. The lucky Blizzard Barrel winner was Maryellen Kumiega of Brewster.

The local business community, with the help of hundreds of Cape Codders, turned National Margarita Day into a BIG win for the Cape Cod Chapter of Big Brothers Big Sisters!
On Thursday, February 22, the community raised $4,000 for the non-profit organization during the National Margarita Day celebration at GUAPO’s Orleans. Nauset Disposal, Cape Cod Broadcasting and Bayside Tent co-hosted the fundraiser, helping reach the 4K tally.
The annual fundraiser featured a festive party where revelers enjoyed a heated tent, margarita samples, food stations and a boomerang photo booth in exchange for a donation to Big Brothers Big Sisters. Additional funds were raised through the annual Blizzard Barrel giveaway. Party goers purchased chances to win the 95-gallon Nauset Disposal barrel, which was filled with products, gift cards, sports tickets and more donated by local businesses….a total of more than $2,000 in prizes! More than 40 local businesses contributed to the prize. The lucky Blizzard Barrel winner was Maryellen Kumiega of Brewster.

nto Mountains as its background, the Desert House was one of Palm Springs’ earliest modern-style homes that has now grown to the largest collection in the U.S. including John Lautner’s Hope Residence for Bob and Dolores Hope and his Elrod House as seen in the James Bond flick Diamonds Are Forever, Frank Sinatra’s Twin Palms, the Elvis Presley honeymoon home, and the Dinah Shore Estate that is now owned by Leonardo DiCaprio.
The five-bedroom Desert House became a celebrity only a year after its completion when architectural- photographer Julius Schulman created a black-and-white photograph of the house, which gave it international attention and praise. Over twenty years later, society-photographer Slim Aarons’ photo “Poolside Gossip” of two women talking by the home’s pool has become a classic as popular today as when it was taken. Constructed of steel, glass and stone on an open floor plan, almost all Desert House rooms open to attractive outdoor scenery. The living room has a floor-to-ceiling stone fireplace and the entertainment lounge has a bar and is also open to the outdoors, all in California style with vanishing thresholds between indoor and outdoor living space. In addition to a desert garden, the back opens to emerald green grass and plantings surrounding the large pool terrace with stunning mountain views, all sited on over two acres.
The Kaufmann Desert House, having undergone a five-year restoration by Marmol Radziner, is now for sale at $25 million. It is listed by Gerard Bisignano, a partner at Vista Sotheby’s International Realty, Palos Verdes Estates.

The accuracy of the results you’ll get will significantly depend on the details that you’ve got inputted into the software program. On the whole, reality TV remodeling estimates are merely far lower than they are in real life, and generally don’t factor in the true cost of labor.

What activities and amenities are available for families at El Valle Golf Resort
------------correct----------------------
n average of 11ºC in December and January) and warm summers (where the daily maximum regularly exceeds 40ºC).
The coastline of Murcia is characterised by its sandy beaches. The most beautiful natural wonder on the coast is the Mar Menor,(small sea) . It is a shallow lagoon or pool, which is the largest of its kind in Spain. The water in the lagoon is very salty and maintains a hot temperature (5ºC above the average Mediterranean temperature), this is located just 15 minutes away from El Valle. So after a busy day's golf/relaxing by the pool, you can head to this or one of the many other wonderful beaches and share a jug of sangria and dish of paella at one of the many beachside bars, cafes and restaurants.
There are a variety of water sports available, these include jet skiing, wind surfing, sailing, fishing, snorkelling, and scuba diving.
Retail therapy is one pastime in which you can indulge whilst visiting Murcia.
The city of Murcia itself boasts a wealth of shops and department stores so a day there would certainly pass pleasantly, whilst in the evening you can try the traditional Spanish restaurants and Tapas bars.
Dos Mares (15-20mins drive) is a shopping centre in San Javier with a large selection of retail outlets, as is Nueva Condominia (NC)(20-25mins drive towards Murcia). There is even a Primark at NC. Both of these centres contain cinemas and 10 pin bowling alleys as well as extensive food halls.
If you are travelling with children(or even if you aren't), there are plenty of things to do and places to go.
There is a brand new water park just opened - Terra Aqua Murcia and an animal park, Terra Natura, just 15mins away from the villa. Aquapolis is another water park, which is further away in Torrevieja (approx. 45mins) but is well worth a trip.
For the more outdoor type there are the numerous natural features for you to discover. As the name suggests El Valle is in a valley, surrounded by magnificent mountain ranges whilst not too far away are some of Spain's beautiful national park areas.
Murcia and Cartegena are both cities rich in the culture and history of Spain. Murcia's cathedral is over 600 years old and it's architecture is stunning, whilst Cartagena boasts a history dating back to the year 227bc and has a plethora of monuments and archeological sites.
These are just some of the delights that await you in one of the most unspoilt areas in modern Spain.

Just back from eight days in this villa.
We have stayed in many villas. This was by far the best.
The owners were lovely to deal with and made booking very easy. They were also very helpful and informative. Nothing was too much trouble.
The villa is large and airy and well furnished.
Outdoors it has a gorgeous solar heated pool. This warmed up very well over our time the nd by the time we left it was glorious.
There is outdoor table tennis,large dominos,draughts ,connect 4!
The hot tub is the main attraction for us and we really enjoyed it.
There is even a private putting green!
Vila is well equipped with tennis rackets,golf clubs etc.
Property is managed by a very nice man who was so helpful but unintrusive. We have stayed in villas prior where over zealous managers kept calling in. It can be annoying.
Hot tub was cleaned and serviced during our stay and pool was cleaned. Very impressed.
You need a car to visit larger supermarkets although there is a small supermarket on site. The villa feels secure and has security operating on the resort.
Our kids had an absolute ball. They are aged 2,4,6,8 and ten and they were constantly occupied. Wen they tired of the pool they went in the tub or played golf. When it was too hot they say on the lovely garden furniture and played dominos.
Vila has two lovely outdoor barbecues,proper charcoal ones,and a choice if outdoor seating .
So a very positive,effusive review from my very fussy family!!
The Power's represent one of our typical target customer types - families, and so it's really rewarding to see them take full advantage of all the facilities on offer and provide such positive feedback - makes the long hours worthwhile!

"Excellent holiday villa"
The villa was very impressive and more than we expected. You could not want for anything as it was all provided. The resort was fantastic and had a small shopping mall that provided all the essentials. The golf was great and I managed to get a good deal on a round and buggy. The whole holiday was a joy and I am very great full to the owners for there professionalism.

Our family had the most delightful stay at the Villa Roja in October 2011. It exceed our expectations and had absolutely everything we could possibly want or need to enjoy our holiday - even the weather was wonderful for October! The owners have thought of absolutely everything and it felt like we were staying in a 5 star hotel (minus the room service!). Being able to play table tennis and Mini Golf was just great!

The villa was very impressive and more than we expected. You could not want for anything as it was all provided. The resort was fantastic and had a small shopping mall that provided all the essentials. The golf was great and I managed to get a good deal on a round and buggy.

"Fabulous Villa in El Valle Golf Resort, Murcia"
Our family had the most delightful stay at the Villa Roja in October 2011. It exceed our expectations and had absolutely everything we could possibly want or need to enjoy our holiday - even the weather was wonderful for October! The owners have thought of absolutely everything and it felt like we were staying in a 5 star hotel (minus the room service!). Being able to play table tennis and Mini Golf was just great! Usually when we are on holiday we a

I would like to think that my parents did a good job in raising me, providing all the positive reinforcement a young boy needs, including the popular statement from page 826, paragraph 7f, of the parenting handbook, “Honey, when you grow up, you can be anything you want to be”.
How’s that for a torturous open-ended statement for Libra child, facing a lifetime of weighing the pros and the cons of career planning? No pressure there!
Fortunately, life deals us a variety of hands that help shape that wide, open-ended statement into something that gradually narrows into what might seem like a career path. Factors like interest, talent, perseverance and perhaps even things like eye-hand coordination (or lack thereof) gradually eliminate a few options, bit by bit, without really trying too hard.
It is clear that hockey player, pro golfer and baseball player were never on the table for me. When it came to natural affinity, I don’t think I was cut out to be a scientist since Physics was one of my worst subjects.
However, I did inherit (if one can actually inherit these) a head for numbers from my Dad and an affinity for creativity and language from my Mom so I was indeed lucky with the doors that were open to me.
Here they are: The Top 10 Things I Wanted to Be When I Grew Up
10 – An elevator operator
Yes, I am of a vintage that remembers a time when people were hired to drive elevators. The elevators of yesteryear were not fully automated like today, as the doors needed a human to open and close them. I remember visits to a big downtown department store when I was very young and thought driving an elevator all day would be the coolest thing and that the people operating them had the coolest job EVER! I admit that I was also impressed by the very smart elevator operator uniforms. Unfortunately the fully automated elevator came in shortly thereafter and dashed those dreams… darn technology!
9 – A dentist
This one lasted for a LONG time and I believe it was inspired from Hermey, the elf in the Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer Christmas Special on television. I remember my Grade 7 composition on “What I Want To Be When I Grow Up” was indeed on the theme of dentistry. To prepare for that composition I spent a few afternoons at the library reading everything available on the topic. The research was hard core (well, about as hard core and scientific as a 12 year old’s research can get) and I knocked that composition out of the park. However, I spent so much time in the orthodontist’s chair in my teens getting my bottom teeth straightened, I lost interest.
8 – A corporate trainer
As an adult, I am very fortunate in not being prone to much “stage fright” when it comes to public speaking. That being the case, when I have had been asked to deliver training, I always thought it was a huge rush (and an even greater privilege) in seeing light bulb moments in the eyes of the audience members when they pick up on the concepts that are being conveyed. Also, there is no greater compliment than when I meet a former student weeks or months later who says that something I said stuck with them and that they were able to apply it, or that I took a complex issue and really made it easy to understand.
I haven’t ruled this one out yet… there is still time.
7 – A priest
There have been many soft signs over the years that have indicated I might have been right for this job. I believe I am good with people, a good listener, naturally inclined toward encouraging people and have known the value of the “spiritual tune-up” one can

What are the two strategies that Paramount might be employing with the release of the movie during the Christmas season

release, meaning this movie will be competing for attention against blockbusters and Oscar contenders, mostly films released over Christmas.
Paramount is either A) saying not to expect much here, lowering expectations or B) counter-programming against “prestige” pictures with a little lowdown lady-powered comedy that could make some noise.

ntemporary artists in the Native American community dealing
with the very question you are asking. I cannot remeber the artist, but
they are creating Kachina dolls out of materials that are not
traditionally used when creating one. We covered this artist in class,
and it raised some great questions.
Depending on the grade you are teaching, you could present this artist and
what they are doing and ask the students what they think about it.
If you need more information, let me know, I can ask my professor about

Why does Washington need to win against Pittsburgh in the Winter Classic
------------correct----------------------
With tonight’s Winter Classic dropping the puck at 8 p.m. we see two teams that are indeed rivals that are sitting at the top of the Eastern Conference. Don’t let their place in the standings fool you though, there are stark differences between the two and how they’re playing leading into tonight’s game.
Washington has put their eight-game losing streak behind them and they’ve won four of their last five games but that one loss in the middle of that is to Pittsburgh. With the teams only meeting four times this season, each game brings a special kind of heat to it and with tonight’s game being the Winter Classic, the pressure is intense to win each game to prove a point.
But who needs to win this game more? For us, the answer is obvious. Washington needs to get a win tonight and if you’ve seen any part of HBO’s 24/7 you know why. The Capitals need a confidence boost.
The Caps’ recent success is good for them because it keeps them from being the quiet and sullen team they appeared to be on 24/7. That said, getting wins over Ottawa, New Jersey, and Carolina aren’t really awe-inspiring. Their 3-0 shutout win over Montreal was a solid psychological boost after their failure against Montreal last year. A win against the Penguins in Pittsburgh today in front of 65,000 fans is the exact kind of win this temperamental Caps team needs to stay focused and to completely put that miserable losing streak in the past for good.
What would be best for Washington would be to beat Pittsburgh and beat them handily with their offensive stars like

What are the two targeted therapies that may replace chemotherapy for treating HER2-positive breast cancer
------------correct----------------------
(RxWiki News) Aggressive breast cancer requires aggressive treatment. The therapy for one menacing type of breast cancer – HER2-positive – almost always involves chemotherapy. Maybe not for everyone, though.
Medical researchers are turning the page on treating this cancer.
Women with HER2-positive breast cancer may no longer need chemotherapy. Instead, they could begin receiving two targeted therapies that knock out the cancer cells themselves, according to a new study.
Two existing medications – Tykerb (lapatinib) and Herceptin (trastuzumab) – were shown in a recent study to attack the cancer on multiple fronts. This powerful drug combination delivered fatal blows to the cancer cells.
"Research your cancer treatment options."
Mothaffar Rimawi, MD, medical director of the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center at Baylor College of Medicine and first study author, said, "This study really epitomizes the whole new era of cancer medicine, using effective targeted treatments against selected subsets of patients resulting in high efficacy."
The goal of this study was to see if the combination therapy could not only shut down tumor growth, but also prevent the tumors from becoming resistant to treatment.
This clinical trial involved 64 women with HER2-positive breast cancer, an aggressive form of the disease in which the protein HER2 is overexpressed. Some of the women also had cancers that were driven by estrogen, or estrogen receptor positive (ER+) cancer.
The medications attack the HER2 from different angles.

With tonight’s Winter Classic dropping the puck at 8 p.m. we see two teams that are indeed rivals that are sitting at the top of the Eastern Conference. Don’t let their place in the standings fool you though, there are stark differences between the two and how they’re playing leading into tonight’s game.
Washington has put their eight-game losing streak behind them and they’ve won four of their last five games but that one loss in the middle of that is to Pittsburgh. With the teams only meeting four times this season, each game brings a special kind of heat to it and with tonight’s game being the Winter Classic, the pressure is intense to win each game to prove a point.
But who needs to win this game more? For us, the answer is obvious. Washington needs to get a win tonight and if you’ve seen any part of HBO’s 24/7 you know why. The Capitals need a confidence boost.
The Caps’ recent success is good for them because it keeps them from being the quiet and sullen team they appeared to be on 24/7. That said, getting wins over Ottawa, New Jersey, and Carolina aren’t really awe-inspiring. Their 3-0 shutout win over Montreal was a solid psychological boost after their failure against Montreal last year. A win against the Penguins in Pittsburgh today in front of 65,000 fans is the exact kind of win this temperamental Caps team needs to stay focused and to completely put that miserable losing streak in the past for good.
What would be best for Washington would be to beat Pittsburgh and beat them handily with their offensive stars like

se two medications for years. Previous laboratory and animal studies strongly suggested these medications were more powerful together than was either drug separately.
Study members had large tumors and a median age of 40. They received the combination therapy for 12 weeks before surgery.
Researchers found that the combination of lapatinib and trastuzumab effectively eliminated evidence of the disease in 21 percent of ER+ patients and 36 percent of ER– (estrogen receptor negative) cancers.
That these results were achieved – without what the authors call the "sledgehammer" of chemotherapy – could be a huge advancement.
“Our data support the hypothesis that selected patients with HER2-positive tumors may not need chemotherapy, and more-complete blockade of HER receptors and ER is an effective strategy worthy of further study,” the authors concluded.
“This is interesting data which suggest that a subset of women with HER2-positive breast cancer may not need chemotherapy to treat their disease," Adam Brufsky, MD, PhD, professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburg School of Medicine, told dailyRx News.
"The issue is, at this point, we are not 100 percent sure who these women with HER2-positive breast cancer are.”
This study was published April 8 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. This study was supported by GlaxoSmithKline and the Translational Breast Cancer Research Consortium. Several authors reported having financial relationships with Genentech (maker of Herceptin), GlaxoSmithKline (maker of Tykerb), NanoString Technologies, Novartis and Pfizer.

Where Real Estate Is Never Boring!
POMPANO BEACH, Fla. (PRWEB) December 04, 2020
“Palm Springs' Desert House”
Edgar J. Kaufmann made architectural history twice. First when he hired Frank Lloyd Wright to design his home, Fallingwater, in Pennsylvania in 1935 and again in 1946 when he commissioned Richard Neutra to create his famed Desert House in Palm Springs. After undergoing a five-year restoration by Marmol Radziner, the Desert House is on the market at $25 million.
Kaufmann, owner of Kaufmann’s department store in Pittsburgh, which later became Macy’s, was a patron of the arts in the Steel City and contributed heavily toward their advancement. A prominent leader in the retail world, Kaufmann took over the family business at age 28 and quickly tripled the flagship store’s sales, eventually expanding the number of stores to 59 across five Midwestern states. Kaufmann led the good life of great wealth which allowed him to give back to his city by making large financial contributions to develop its cultural offerings including opera, building the city’s Civic Center and supporting local artists by commissioning their work.
After Kaufmann died in 1955, the home went through a series of owners including singer Barry Manilow and Gene Klein who was one of California’s most successful used-car dealers and owner of the San Diego Chargers. After some questionable renovations and years of neglect, the home was purchased in 1992 by an architectural historian and her husband who spent years restoring the home to its original design.

What notable contributions did Edgar J. Kaufmann make to the arts in Pittsburgh
------------correct----------------------
Where Real Estate Is Never Boring!
POMPANO BEACH, Fla. (PRWEB) December 04, 2020
“Palm Springs' Desert House”
Edgar J. Kaufmann made architectural history twice. First when he hired Frank Lloyd Wright to design his home, Fallingwater, in Pennsylvania in 1935 and again in 1946 when he commissioned Richard Neutra to create his famed Desert House in Palm Springs. After undergoing a five-year restoration by Marmol Radziner, the Desert House is on the market at $25 million.
Kaufmann, owner of Kaufmann’s department store in Pittsburgh, which later became Macy’s, was a patron of the arts in the Steel City and contributed heavily toward their advancement. A prominent leader in the retail world, Kaufmann took over the family business at age 28 and quickly tripled the flagship store’s sales, eventually expanding the number of stores to 59 across five Midwestern states. Kaufmann led the good life of great wealth which allowed him to give back to his city by making large financial contributions to develop its cultural offerings including opera, building the city’s Civic Center and supporting local artists by commissioning their work.
After Kaufmann died in 1955, the home went through a series of owners including singer Barry Manilow and Gene Klein who was one of California’s most successful used-car dealers and owner of the San Diego Chargers. After some questionable renovations and years of neglect, the home was purchased in 1992 by an architectural historian and her husband who spent years restoring the home to its original design.

Our Villas (Villa Roja and Villa Azul) are next door to each other, are frontline to the stunning El Valle 18 hole golf course and ideal for families and friends who like to holiday together but still enjoy their own privacy. These Villas are the large 3 double bedroom types (Algabas) on a 760m2 plot. They each have a large private pool (10m x 5m). (Be aware of other 3 Bed Villas on El Valle (Alcors) on a plot of 490m2 with smaller pool).
All bedrooms also have the pull-out option of an extra single bed, as all rooms are large enough, which may help families wishing to share with others, or golfers to spread the cost a little bit further.
Bedroom 1: The Master bedroom has a King size bed that can also be set up as twin beds and also has the pull-out option of an extra single bed. There is a large en-suite and walk-in wardrobe. Linen is provided and there are two bedside cabinets and lamps. This bedroom is particularly luxurious as it has 2 sets of patio doors that open up onto the terrace and pool area and a walk-in dressing area.
The en-suite includes a whirlpool bath, double basins, shower, bidet and wc.
Bedroom 2: This bedroom has a King size bed that can also be set up as twin beds. Linen is provided and there is a bedside cabinet and lamp. This bedroom has patio doors that open up onto the putting green and terraced area at the side of the villa.

|Further details outdoors|
The luxury of the villa is extended outside. By the side of the lounge area there is a fabulously large covered conservatory, you can choose to sit and relax here on the rattan suite, whilst being cooled by the 3 ceiling fans and sipping a long drink in the heat of the day. We have a Hot Tub under the conservatory to relax in if you don´t fancy the pool or for those cooler evenings. You could try your hand at table tennis on the full size table available. You could opt to sit under the other seating area by the pool and watch the golfers go by, maybe picking up the odd tip to try on your next round.
You also have your own private putting green practice area to the side of the villa. It has 5 sunken holes as well as undulations to really test your putting skills. We´ve provided adult, junior and toddler putters so that you can start them early or have a good practice before setting off for your round! Haven´t seen this in any other villa and adds an extra dimension to your family or golfing holiday. The putting green can also be used to play bowls on, with our real weighted carpet(mini) bowls!
The rear of the property overlooks the 12th hole (par 3) and the fantastic tranquil view of the neighbouring mountain range. Golf clubs - For those irregular/fair-weather golfers or those wishing to just experience the El Valle course without the cost of taking out their own set of clubs, we have provided 9 sets (7 adult(1 left handed), 2 junior plus a putter/wedge for a toddler) for use during your stay.
If you want a large extended family/friends holiday....book both villas together and get the bonus of all facilities in each - together the 2 villas can accommodate 16 guests.

threatens us as a nation, shallow pride which feeds off fear, and mostly from the promises which have proven so deceiving these past ten years." Change "ten" to "four," and you get the idea. The rest of the essay is stunningly humble, and it is simply a call to be citizens with eyes and ears open, to allow that maybe the powerful are more concerned with keeping power than with admitting error. And it is horribly, frighteningly prescient. What people forget about Kerry's protest days is that he was defending the lives of soldiers and that he was right.
Kerry vs. Reagan: When Kerry faced down the Reagan administration in his dogged pursuit of the Contra-drug connection, he was a freshman Senator taking on one of the most popular Presidents in American history. Instead of backing down from repeated threats to his political career, Kerry had his staff stay on the case like a viper injecting venom into your leg. They would have had to cut off his head in order to get him to stop, and he stayed on it until he revealed that the Reagan administration allowed the Contras to smuggle cocaine into the U.S. in order to fund their CIA-led "war" against the legally-elected Sandinistas in Nicaragua. (And thus helping to cause the crack epidemic.) Kerry was called a conspiracy theorist, said to be interfering with other drug cases, and impugned throughout the media. But the part that rarely got told is that he was right.
Kerry vs. Bush I: When Kerry went after the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, which was involved in laundering the Contra drug money, funneling money from the U.S. to Saddam Hussein (when he was our beloved dictator), and supporting illegal arms trade with terrorists and drug lords (including Afghanistan), it was his first chance to take on the Bush dynasty. When Bush I was in power, the administration and the CIA overlooked the crimes of BCCI, possibly because the bank was intimately involved in the financial dealings of the Bush family. Kerry had already kicked ass on the savings and loan scandals of the 1980s, so why not fuck with George H.W. Bush if 41 was fucking over the good of the country and the world? He brought down BCCI, and he cut off a vital funding source for terrorists. Again, Kerry was bucking the will of Democrats in Congress, as well as a Republican administration, in order to do what he knew was right.
Listen closely and tell anyone you know who is still thinking about voting for Bush: has Bush ever, personally, faced down anyone other than with a chant of "Drink, drink, drink"? Has he ever gone against someone who was really, truly powerful in order to place the good of the people above his own good? No. Heroes do that - they don't care what's in their way - they will face down evil, no matter how powerful. And they don't bother with those who are too weak to fight. It's why the latest news from Iraq fanned the fire: those in charge have screwed us over again, and Kerry's ready to bring the superhero costume out. Call him "the Winter Soldier."
Kerry's done a fuck of a lot more than pull a guy out of a river. And the fact that America doesn't know that says a great deal about how we negotiate our desolate political landscape

(RxWiki News) Aggressive breast cancer requires aggressive treatment. The therapy for one menacing type of breast cancer – HER2-positive – almost always involves chemotherapy. Maybe not for everyone, though.
Medical researchers are turning the page on treating this cancer.
Women with HER2-positive breast cancer may no longer need chemotherapy. Instead, they could begin receiving two targeted therapies that knock out the cancer cells themselves, according to a new study.
Two existing medications – Tykerb (lapatinib) and Herceptin (trastuzumab) – were shown in a recent study to attack the cancer on multiple fronts. This powerful drug combination delivered fatal blows to the cancer cells.
"Research your cancer treatment options."
Mothaffar Rimawi, MD, medical director of the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center at Baylor College of Medicine and first study author, said, "This study really epitomizes the whole new era of cancer medicine, using effective targeted treatments against selected subsets of patients resulting in high efficacy."
The goal of this study was to see if the combination therapy could not only shut down tumor growth, but also prevent the tumors from becoming resistant to treatment.
This clinical trial involved 64 women with HER2-positive breast cancer, an aggressive form of the disease in which the protein HER2 is overexpressed. Some of the women also had cancers that were driven by estrogen, or estrogen receptor positive (ER+) cancer.
The medications attack the HER2 from different angles.
This team of researchers has been working with the

------------question-----------------------
What should be done with the landscaping fabric for aesthetic reasons
------------correct----------------------
Cover the back again, but this time with a double layer of landscaping fabric. This is mainly for aesthetic reasons, as the plastic is pretty ugly!
Measure where you want your slats to sit on the pallet. You probably won’t use all of the slats – try to leave at least 2.5 inches between each slat to make planting easier. Mark where each slat will go with a pencil, but don’t nail them down yet!
Create the dirt pockets. Using landscaping fabric, create a pocket on the underside of each slat. This is easiest when the slats haven’t been nailed down yet. We cut a strip of landscaping fabric, doubled it up, and stapled it first to the back of one slat. Then, we placed the slat down where we made pencil marks, and the stapled the other side of the landscaping fabric to the pallet. Repeat for each section. Make sure your pockets are deep enough that they will hold enough dirt, but not so deep that they will droop too much into the space below!
Nail down your slats!
Fill your pockets with potting soil, and start planting! We recommend doing this with the pallet leaning against the wall so that it is almost vertical.
Tip: Don’t overfill the pockets – the dirt should only come up to the top of each wood slat. Place the roots of each plant into the dirt on an angle and pack them in tightly.
Hang your living wall! This is optional, as they would look equally good propped up. We chose to hang ours using 3inch eyehooks and a heavy-duty chain. If you do hang your living wall, be sure to drill into studs so that the weight of the garden doesn’t rip out your drywall.
That’s it! Enjoy your new recycled living wall!

------------question-----------------------
What career path does the author express the strongest desire to pursue
------------correct----------------------
get from a great church experience. Again, with no real “stage fright”, having to deliver a sermon every week would not have been a problem. There have been times that I wanted to be part of that and thought I had what it would take. However, the vow of poverty was a deal breaker… I like shoes way too much for that.
6 – A ventriloquist
I recently had a weird flashback to childhood, remembering spending time in front of the mirror trying to talk without moving my lips. I thought it was just a sad “only child” thing I did, at a time when we only had 12 TV channels to choose from and 1 TV in the house, but then came a memory of actually thinking I could cut it as a ventriloquist. Thank god I didn’t follow that dream! Ironically, as an adult, I get easily creeped out by ventriloquist dummies, so I can only suspect I was more inspired by Shari Lewis and Lambchop more than any of the other ventriloquist teams of that era.
5 – A pharmacist
After working part time in “your friendly neighbourhood pharmacy” throughout my high school years, one can’t help but get influenced a little by one’s surroundings and the people we work with. For a while, pharmacist was on the list, but let’s just say that my best courses at school were pointing more toward a future in business than sciences, so that fell off the radar.
4 – A hairstylist
Given the amount of time I spent on my hair in the 1980’s and 1990’s, how can one NOT consider hairstylist as a career option.
3 – A manager
My professional career was built on a slow and steady journey, gradually climbing the corporate ladder with the goal of eventually becoming a manager. I was very lucky in that I had received 5 opportunities to “act” for a few months in a management position due to temporary vacancies. After 5 times of trying very hard to make it work, but struggling, often feeling like a fish swimming against the current, I concluded it was not for me. It was great experience and I received compliments on my abilities as a manager but to be honest, I don’t think I was a natural at it.
2 – A Wal-Mart Greeter
With only a few years left to retirement, some people have already been kidding that because of my sunny disposition and relentless cheerfulness, I should become a Wal-Mart Greeter when I retire. I admit, if I ever needed some extra cash, that would probably be the most natural way to go for me, but I have a feeling retirement will be all about what is #1 on the list:
1 – A writer
The idea of becoming a writer only really hit me in my university years even though I always had an easy time expressing myself in writing. This blog has really been a source of inspiration in itself in demonstrating to me that what I can do here is just the tip of the iceberg of what awaits when I can do this full time. I really look forward to it!
Ironically, public servant was not in my Top 10, but in retrospect, I worked for a very dynamic Agency that offered challenging assignments that pushed me beyond my limits and my comfort zones, which helped me become the person I am today. I am proud of several accomplishments to which I contributed while working with great people, some of whom I know will be lifelong friends. For those reasons, and many more, when looking back, I wouldn’t have changed a thing.

n average of 11ºC in December and January) and warm summers (where the daily maximum regularly exceeds 40ºC).
The coastline of Murcia is characterised by its sandy beaches. The most beautiful natural wonder on the coast is the Mar Menor,(small sea) . It is a shallow lagoon or pool, which is the largest of its kind in Spain. The water in the lagoon is very salty and maintains a hot temperature (5ºC above the average Mediterranean temperature), this is located just 15 minutes away from El Valle. So after a busy day's golf/relaxing by the pool, you can head to this or one of the many other wonderful beaches and share a jug of sangria and dish of paella at one of the many beachside bars, cafes and restaurants.
There are a variety of water sports available, these include jet skiing, wind surfing, sailing, fishing, snorkelling, and scuba diving.
Retail therapy is one pastime in which you can indulge whilst visiting Murcia.
The city of Murcia itself boasts a wealth of shops and department stores so a day there would certainly pass pleasantly, whilst in the evening you can try the traditional Spanish restaurants and Tapas bars.
Dos Mares (15-20mins drive) is a shopping centre in San Javier with a large selection of retail outlets, as is Nueva Condominia (NC)(20-25mins drive towards Murcia). There is even a Primark at NC. Both of these centres contain cinemas and 10 pin bowling alleys as well as extensive food halls.
If you are travelling with children(or even if you aren't), there are plenty of things to do and places to go.
There is a brand new water park just opened - Terra Aqua Murcia and an animal park, Terra Natura, just 15mins away from the villa. Aquapolis is another water park, which is further away in Torrevieja (approx. 45mins) but is well worth a trip.
For the more outdoor type there are the numerous natural features for you to discover. As the name suggests El Valle is in a valley, surrounded by magnificent mountain ranges whilst not too far away are some of Spain's beautiful national park areas.
Murcia and Cartegena are both cities rich in the culture and history of Spain. Murcia's cathedral is over 600 years old and it's architecture is stunning, whilst Cartagena boasts a history dating back to the year 227bc and has a plethora of monuments and archeological sites.
These are just some of the delights that await you in one of the most unspoilt areas in modern Spain.

Just back from eight days in this villa.
We have stayed in many villas. This was by far the best.
The owners were lovely to deal with and made booking very easy. They were also very helpful and informative. Nothing was too much trouble.
The villa is large and airy and well furnished.
Outdoors it has a gorgeous solar heated pool. This warmed up very well over our time the nd by the time we left it was glorious.
There is outdoor table tennis,large dominos,draughts ,connect 4!
The hot tub is the main attraction for us and we really enjoyed it.
There is even a private putting green!
Vila is well equipped with tennis rackets,golf clubs etc.
Property is managed by a very nice man who was so helpful but unintrusive. We have stayed in villas prior where over zealous managers kept calling in. It can be annoying.
Hot tub was cleaned and serviced during our stay and pool was cleaned. Very impressed.
You need a car to visit larger supermarkets although there is a small supermarket on site. The villa feels secure and has security operating on the resort.
Our kids had an absolute ball. They are aged 2,4,6,8 and ten and they were constantly occupied. Wen they tired of the pool they went in the tub or played golf. When it was too hot they say on the lovely garden furniture and played dominos.
Vila has two lovely outdoor barbecues,proper charcoal ones,and a choice if outdoor seating .
So a very positive,effusive review from my very fussy family!!
The Power's represent one of our typical target customer types - families, and so it's really rewarding to see them take full advantage of all the facilities on offer and provide such positive feedback - makes the long hours worthwhile!

"Excellent holiday villa"
The villa was very impressive and more than we expected. You could not want for anything as it was all provided. The resort was fantastic and had a small shopping mall that provided all the essentials. The golf was great and I managed to get a good deal on a round and buggy. The whole holiday was a joy and I am very great full to the owners for there professionalism.

"Fabulous Villa in El Valle Golf Resort, Murcia"
Our family had the most delightful stay at the Villa Roja in October 2011. It exceed our expectations and had absolutely everything we could possibly want or need to enjoy our holiday - even the weather was wonderful for October! The owners have thought of absolutely everything and it felt like we were staying in a 5 star hotel (minus the room service!). Being able to play table tennis and Mini Golf was just great! Usually when we are on holiday we a

------------question-----------------------
What are the main criticisms of the Metamorphosis ability for Warlocks as mentioned in the text
------------correct----------------------
monologist from all other Warlocks. It's powerful, it grants us amazing abilities, and it of course makes one look like one of the greatest villains of all time. Yet, despite it's obvious greatness, many Warlocks criticize Metamorphosis for being simply a cosmetic change, only really increasing damage done, because the abilities granted to a Metamorphosed Warlock are all but worthless. A taunt, a melee attack, a charge and an immolation aura really are only useful for a tank in melee combat, exactly what a Warlock doesn't want to find himself in. So this ability needs to change what it gives, but more over affect the abilities a Warlock already uses. Recently, Tree of Life was changed to work like Metamorphosis, but instead of adding more abilities it changed the ones they currently use. This approach should be taken to Metamorphosis, perhaps going so far as to make the entire rotation change. I'd like to see some significant changes; Curroptions that work more like instant blasts of shadow magic, dealing the same damage but in a much smaller time, Shadowbolts that fire three in one shot, to hit multiple or the same target, Immolates that burst and make new Immolate ticks, Soul Fires becoming spammable, and so forth. I would love that Metamorphosis isn't just a visual or damage dealing change, but a complete and total change to the Warlock, that Metamorphosis should be an amazing thing to use.
4. Affliction. Early in my raiding career, I switched to Affliction because Demonology was simply not a raiding spec. I did both Naxxramas and Ulduar as an Affliction Warlock, and I must admit it is a very fun spec. It's the oldest viable DPS spec for Warlocks, back when Demonology was only for leveling and Destruction was for the odd Warlock who wanted to be like a Mage and endlessly fire Shadowbolt. Ironic, as now Affliction's worst criticism is that it is the new Shadowbolt spammer. Yet, it is still a very solid spec, keeping four DoTs, Haunt, Unstable Affliction, Curroption and Curse of Agony, up at any one time, filling in the duration of those with Shadowbolt volleys. Long ago, the pet of choice was ambiguous for Affliction Warlocks, where some would say the optimal Demon was, in fact, the Doomguard. Now, an Affliction Warlock has his lovable and loyal Felhunter at his side. With the inclusion Soul Swap, nearly all the broken aspects of Affliction are rested. I think the only means of improvement for Affliction really are to add new procs, ways to keep an Affliction Warlock from becoming too locked into a routine. The only real such thing Affliction has is Nightfall, a small chance from a Curroption tick to have an instant cast Shadowbolt, and it both procs far too little to make any meaningful impact on Affliction's rotation, and only makes what you were doing anyway an instant cast. Almost every Nightfall proc I received while playing Affliction was instantly used because I was in the middle of casting Shadowbolt anyway.
A few new interesting talents could really make Affliction a fun yet stable spec to play as a Warlock. I can't help but look at the new Shadow Priest talents for inspiration, as the two are nearly identical; setting up DoTs then filling in the time between them with a powerful Shadow attack. Currently, Shadow Priests have some pretty interesting talents, particularly Shadowy Apparition, which randomly will make a ghost of yourself to attack an enemy. Affliction could make some great use out of abilities like this, or perhaps even non-DPS abilities, like the Shadow Priest's Dispersion, which can add some utility without necessarily increasing damage. All in all, Affliction simply needs some stirring up, a few abilities to add some interesting mechanics, and Affliction will be nigh perfect.
5. Destruction. Between the time I switched from Demonology, and settled on Affliction for raiding, I went with the standard Warlock spec: Destruction. Unfortunately, what I found was not pleasing. I found a spec that played more like a castrated Mage than any Warlock. I would dare to guess that 2/3 of all my casts were Incineration. The rotation is astoundingly simple; Start with Immolate, then with the Glyph of Conflagrate, instantly cast Conflagrate, which won't consume the Immolate, then gain the Backdraft effect, making your first Chaos Bolt quickly, along with two quick Incinerates, then...you simply keep casting Incinerates until Immolate is nearly gone, then Conflagrate, backdrafting everything over again. No cooldowns, no random procs, no real strategy. My favorite looking ability, Chaos Bolt, is relegated to just a green Incinerate. It's such a shame. I think what is required to make Destruction simply a decent spec is to give Destruction some depth, a way to keep a Destruction Warlock having to know what is going on, to separate a skillful player from one who simply pushes the buttons. I can't help but feel that Searing Pain could have a place in a new Destruction, an ability to fit between Chaos Bolt and Incinerate. Perhaps there could be a way to give Searing Pain a value above Incinerate, maybe even have Searing Pain have a high Critical Strike damage, so any proc dealing with Critical Strike would favor Searing Pain as opposed to just continuing to cast Incinerate. I also need to express my disappointment with Glyph of Conflagrate, a Glyph that makes so much difference, yet none at all. On the one hand, it makes it so that Conflagrate doesn't consume the DoT of Immolate, so you can use it both before and after casting Immolate. It essentially makes Conflagrate into a fancy Fireblast. Yet, while this is a significant change, in practicality, it is almost no difference. The cooldown of Conflagrate is the same as the duration of Immolate, meaning that the fact that it can be cast both before and after casting Immolate, this only affects your rotation once. Essentially, with the glyph, you get one free Conflagrate at the beginning of a rotation. Then, you'd only be able to Conflagrate at the end of each Immolate rotation, which is how the original spell was designed. The original spell was designed to, I believe, add a level of skill to when a Warlock should cast it, waiting till the very last second of Immolate's DoT. Many Warlocks now ask for the Glyph to be baseline for the Conflagrate spell, but I think it should be the opposite; the Glyph should simply go away completely. Conflagrate should be used skillfully, watching the last bit of Immolate, thinking about how many more Incinerates you can cast before you Conflagrate. I think with those two major changes, Destruction will change from the beginner's easy spec to a decent spec that can be used skillfully.
That's it. My thoughts and feelings, my hopes and dreams for my favorite class in the game. I hope my thoughts at least coincide with those of the developers, and the things I hope to see will come to pass. I do hope it was at least something interesting for you, the reader, to read, despite how long it may of been.

Cover the back again, but this time with a double layer of landscaping fabric. This is mainly for aesthetic reasons, as the plastic is pretty ugly!
Measure where you want your slats to sit on the pallet. You probably won’t use all of the slats – try to leave at least 2.5 inches between each slat to make planting easier. Mark where each slat will go with a pencil, but don’t nail them down yet!
Create the dirt pockets. Using landscaping fabric, create a pocket on the underside of each slat. This is easiest when the slats haven’t been nailed down yet. We cut a strip of landscaping fabric, doubled it up, and stapled it first to the back of one slat. Then, we placed the slat down where we made pencil marks, and the stapled the other side of the landscaping fabric to the pallet. Repeat for each section. Make sure your pockets are deep enough that they will hold enough dirt, but not so deep that they will droop too much into the space below!
Nail down your slats!
Fill your pockets with potting soil, and start planting! We recommend doing this with the pallet leaning against the wall so that it is almost vertical.
Tip: Don’t overfill the pockets – the dirt should only come up to the top of each wood slat. Place the roots of each plant into the dirt on an angle and pack them in tightly.
Hang your living wall! This is optional, as they would look equally good propped up. We chose to hang ours using 3inch eyehooks and a heavy-duty chain. If you do hang your living wall, be sure to drill into studs so that the weight of the garden doesn’t rip out your drywall.
That’s it! Enjoy your new recycled living wall!

John Kerry - Superhero:
In the vicious end of days in this campaign, so much gets lost in the caterwauling of the media. Here's something that's happened in the last couple of days: John Kerry has found the last piece of the puzzle, the final cause to push to the end of the battle. If you've listened to Kerry since the dual revelations of the missing 760,000 pounds of high-powered explosives from a known ammo dump and the coming request for an additional $70 billion dollars for Iraq and Afghanistan, Kerry has become the man we've all heard about - the unstoppable crusader for what's right against however powerful the forces of evil may be. Kerry has been tough-guy posturing for most of the campaign, and it's been a ludicrous sight. How many animals must be hunted and killed in order for a Democrat to look strong on defense? As Bradley Whitford said on Bill Maher's show last week, "How many times does a guy have to be shot in the ass running across rice paddies in Vietnam in order to look tougher than the cheerleader from Andover?"
Here's the deal - what's been missing from the entire Kerry campaign is just how tough a motherfucker John Kerry really, actually is, and it's got jackshit to do with hunting geese and killing the Vietcong. Kerry is a superhero, the kind of valiant son of a bitch who doesn't give a rat's ass about his own life in order to make the lives of others better. It's his post-Vietnam life that makes him a superhero. You don't know how much a superhero the man in the cape is by his origins. You know a superhero by his deeds. And if Kerry loses, it'll be because his campaign refused to acknowledge just how kick-ass Kerry has been since his final purple heart (and if Kerry loses, adviser Bob Shrum, who, in essence, said the public was too stupid to understand Kerry's accomplishments, should be strung up by his balls and batted around like a pinata by the Democratic party leadership until he bursts open and showers everyone with his innards).
Yeah, yeah, this is gonna be a down-on-the-knees-Kerry-supportin-hummer of an entry, but the Rude Pundit keeps talking to people who sigh and say, "I guess I'm gonna vote for Bush" because they can't bring themselves to vote for Kerry. They see him as weak. They see him as a flip-flopper. In other words, they see him as the projection of self that Bush has imposed on Kerry. In other words, these voters are too blinded by the glow that emits from the crown on Bush's head to believe that they own the democracy.
Kerry vs. Nixon: When Kerry helped organize the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, he was directly confronting a hegemonic ideology in the country that said the people must blindly follow their leaders. Kerry, villified at the time with incredible viciousness, did not back down from charges of treason and heresy. Check out the end of the book The New Soldier, which Kerry co-wrote and edited in order to talk about what the young men returning from Vietnam had confronted in the name of "freedom" from Communism. The book is, ironically enough, mostly reprinted on an anti-Kerry site. Kerry writes, "We are asking America to turn from false glory, hollow victory, fabricated foreign threats, fear which

Ideal for travelers coming to Kalamata by cruise ships for few hours.
We pick you up from your hotel in Kalamata and we go straight to Diros Caves.
Located at the top of the Mani between the town of Pirgos Dirou and Areopolis the entrance of Diros' Caves is a few meters above the sea level. When you enter the cave you walk down a stairway to an underground lake where there are boats waiting. You will be given a life-vest and then each boat gets a guide who uses poles to journey through the caverns

What is the main theme of the second topical semester that NetworkNature recently started
------------correct----------------------
n across the land and sea, to ensure that there is no deterioration in biodiversity conservation status, and that restoration increases the EU’s resilience to climate change as a key nature-based solution. Through funding from the research and innovation policy and the EU Green Deal, significant effort has been mobilised towards implementing nature-based solutions and assisting Europe’s green recovery.
Within this framework, NetworkNature, funded by the Horizon 2020 programme, is creating a resource for local, regional and international cooperation to maximise the impact and spread of nature-based solutions.
NetworkNature has recently started its second topical semester focusing on the theme of ‘Nature-based Solutions for Ecosystem Restoration’, and released a concept note on the topic. It is through this opportunity that I will be collaborating with NetworkNature to share knowledge and experiences by bringing together stakeholders from the five main target audiences, and including everyone from governments to financial organisations and businesses, civil society and individuals, from across the globe.
This is an opportunity to reflect on current principles and frameworks supporting the implementation of ecosystem restoration and promote the uptake and upscaling of restoration initiatives as a valid nature-based solution. We hope to collate evidence of the impacts of ecological restoration on biodiversity and the different dimensions that constitute wellbeing. We are interested to learn about projects that have used ecological restoration to reverse biodiversity decline and increase resilience to climate and environmental drivers. Similarly, we would like to learn about experiences using ecological restoration for place regeneration, providing new economic opportunities and educational, recreation and non-material benefits, and to address distributive, procedural and interactional injustices associated with the management of natural capital.
By sharing experiences of ecological restoration from around the world, developing collaborations and co-creating knowledge, it is possible to replicate and scale-up ecosystem restoration and to reset our relationship with nature to one that fosters stewardship and sustainable management of our natural capital.

# Ask a tutor to update your attendance
If you think that your attendance has been recorded incorrectly (because you have forgotten or lost your student ID card), you can email the tutor and ask them to verify your attendance and update the record manually. You will need to provide:
• Your name / student ID number • Module code • Date / Time of session
If your student ID card is lost, broken or has been stolen, you will need to replace your ID card as soon as possible to make sure you continue to record your attendance.

Alex Ovechkin, Alexander Semin, and Nicklas Backstrom all finding the score sheet. Ovechkin is having a solid season, but his goal numbers are down compared to previous seasons. The lingering feeling that Ovechkin has a goal eruption coming hangs over the team and once it happens (if it happens) the high-scoring Caps we got accustomed to seeing will be back in a big way.
That’s not to say this game isn’t big for the Penguins. The Pens are getting Jordan Staal back in their lineup tonight and that means for the first time this year, the Pens have their full compliment of great players back on the ice. We’ll get a look at how Staal looks with Evgeni Malkin on his wing and if that’s the thing the Penguins needed to take control of the Eastern Conference races.
As it is, the Pens are four points up on both Washington and Tampa Bay for the overall lead in the East. The Pens getting another win, ideally a regulation win with just two points for them and none for the Caps, would work two-fold. The Pens would extend their lead and they’d also deliver a psychological blow to Washington, something that could linger with them all year long.
Overall though, this game is a must-win for Washington. If it turns into another game where they fall behind early and try to gut it out, it creates unnecessary drama for them. After all, moral victories aren’t counted in the standings and when it comes to Pittsburgh, racking up those kinds of wins doesn’t do anything to help them out in the long run and for Washington, that’s what matters the most.

What did the study findings suggest about the need for chemotherapy in women with HER2-positive breast cancer
------------correct----------------------
se two medications for years. Previous laboratory and animal studies strongly suggested these medications were more powerful together than was either drug separately.
Study members had large tumors and a median age of 40. They received the combination therapy for 12 weeks before surgery.
Researchers found that the combination of lapatinib and trastuzumab effectively eliminated evidence of the disease in 21 percent of ER+ patients and 36 percent of ER– (estrogen receptor negative) cancers.
That these results were achieved – without what the authors call the "sledgehammer" of chemotherapy – could be a huge advancement.
“Our data support the hypothesis that selected patients with HER2-positive tumors may not need chemotherapy, and more-complete blockade of HER receptors and ER is an effective strategy worthy of further study,” the authors concluded.
“This is interesting data which suggest that a subset of women with HER2-positive breast cancer may not need chemotherapy to treat their disease," Adam Brufsky, MD, PhD, professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburg School of Medicine, told dailyRx News.
"The issue is, at this point, we are not 100 percent sure who these women with HER2-positive breast cancer are.”
This study was published April 8 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. This study was supported by GlaxoSmithKline and the Translational Breast Cancer Research Consortium. Several authors reported having financial relationships with Genentech (maker of Herceptin), GlaxoSmithKline (maker of Tykerb), NanoString Technologies, Novartis and Pfizer.

The evening also included an opportunity for party-goers to learn more about Big Brothers Big Sisters and the work they do on the Cape. Currently, the organization has 80 littles awaiting mentors. They are particularly in need of male mentors.
“We are so grateful for Guapo’s, Nauset Disposal, CCBM, Bayside Tent and the many other businesses who donated to make this night a huge success!”, said JR Mell, Regional Director for BBBSCCI. “This event raised much needed funding to support our mission and was the perfect venue to kick off our “30 Guys in 30 Days” campaign. In one night we were able to sign up 4 male volunteers who stepped up to make a difference in the life of a child right here on the Cape!”
The National Margarita Day party is part of GUAPO’s long-standing “GUAPO’s GIVES” initiative, through which they raise thousands of dollars annually for local non-profit groups. GUAPO’s is located at 136 Route 6A (Staples Plaza) in Orleans with a second seasonal location in Brewster.

most spectacular builds. Present are most of the weapons, vehicles and consumables from the Battle Royale game, as well as brand new items for maximum creativity.
So – when can you start building? Well, for all owners of the Season 7 Battle Royale Battle Pass you can start making worlds from 6th Dec, and for the rest of the community the fun will begin come December 13th. However all players, regardless of Battle Pass status, will be able to be invited to worlds from the very start.
For a while now Fortnite has catered for pretty much everyone, from the solo-gamer in the Save the World mode to the online player in the ridiculously popular Battle Royale. But now Fortnite has really opened up its doors for everyone and everything. Call it Minecraft 2.0 if you want but we are really not complaining about the chance to let our creative minds, and competitive passions, run free!
If you wish to get involved in Fortnite Creative on Xbox One (or other formats), then Fortnite is available right now on Xbox One, PS4, Nintendo Switch, PC, iOS and Android.

------------question-----------------------
What are the implications of the Capitals winning or losing the game against the Penguins
------------correct----------------------
Alex Ovechkin, Alexander Semin, and Nicklas Backstrom all finding the score sheet. Ovechkin is having a solid season, but his goal numbers are down compared to previous seasons. The lingering feeling that Ovechkin has a goal eruption coming hangs over the team and once it happens (if it happens) the high-scoring Caps we got accustomed to seeing will be back in a big way.
That’s not to say this game isn’t big for the Penguins. The Pens are getting Jordan Staal back in their lineup tonight and that means for the first time this year, the Pens have their full compliment of great players back on the ice. We’ll get a look at how Staal looks with Evgeni Malkin on his wing and if that’s the thing the Penguins needed to take control of the Eastern Conference races.
As it is, the Pens are four points up on both Washington and Tampa Bay for the overall lead in the East. The Pens getting another win, ideally a regulation win with just two points for them and none for the Caps, would work two-fold. The Pens would extend their lead and they’d also deliver a psychological blow to Washington, something that could linger with them all year long.
Overall though, this game is a must-win for Washington. If it turns into another game where they fall behind early and try to gut it out, it creates unnecessary drama for them. After all, moral victories aren’t counted in the standings and when it comes to Pittsburgh, racking up those kinds of wins doesn’t do anything to help them out in the long run and for Washington, that’s what matters the most.

How is Salma Hayek portrayed in the text segment
------------correct----------------------
It’s been mostly miss or miss, with hits pretty rare, since Tiffany Haddish broke out with “Girls’ Trip.”
Pairing her up with Rose Byrne, under-rated as a comedienne, but damned funny in “Neighbors” and “Bridesmaids” and “Get Him to the Greek,” is a smart play.
And Salma Hayek as badassed and predatory? That’s a slam dunk.

It seems to be an amazingly exciting time in the Cataclysm beta, with classes everywhere being improved and redesigned. Paladins now have Holy Power, Shaman can duel wield at level 10, Priests can make shadowy apparitions of themselves, Hunters have focus, and so on. Pity I'm not part of it. Yet, I see Warlock lagging far behind. There has been very little change to the Warlock trees, and the Soul Shard system in particular seems to be in a ludicrously low level of development. There are only six uses for Soul Shards right now, and gathering them is just as much a hassle as it is today. I believe there are still many changes to come, but in this early stage of development, I've decided to post my wish list for the Cataclysm Warlock.
1. Soul Shards. I hope so deeply that this mechanic comes from the muck of development as a shining and brilliant mechanic, the envy of Spellcasters everywhere. As of right now, the theory is that Soul Shards should be used as a resource, consumed by the spell Soulburn, to alter spells. Yet, right now, the only spells that are affected are the summon Demon spells, making them instant cast, Drain Life, which reduces casting speed on its target, Teleporting to the Demonic Circle, which increases your movement speed once you've teleported, making Soul fire an instant cast and Searing Pain guaranteed to be a critical strike. Very minor changes. The issue right now really is how to balance situational use with rotational use. Some Warlocks hold that anything less than a damage increase makes this new mechanic pointless. I, in fact, believe the opposite. Right now the theory goes that a Warlock should "Consume 3 Soul Shards" every boss encounter, while I think the philosophy should instead be that a Warlock, in a pure DPS fight or a, pardon the crude vernacular, "Tank-and-spank" boss, should not have to use any Soul Shards. It should be a mechanic used when under pressure, when rotations break down and a Warlock needs to make a snap choice what to do. Yes, a Warlock won't use their Soul Shards every fight, but when they do it should be a rather impressive show of skill and ability to use it right.
Moreover, I'm personally bothered by the current way to regain Soul Shards, which is to either use Drain Soul when a creature is about to die, or Soul Harvest to regain life and Soul Shards. Both feel very clumsy, and were the hallmarks of the problems of the old Soul Shard system. A crucial part of a class's resource system shouldn't be replenished by spells, it should be an innate mechanic that regenerates on its own. I believe the current issue on this revolves around the fear that Warlocks will simply break combat to regenerate Soul Shards, then return to battle with a fresh set of abilities, and while having to manually gain Soul Shards helps this problem, I still think it needs much more polish and design change, so that it will be an automatic process.
2. Curses. Warlocks have always had a difficult decision to make, both in PVE and PVP, over whether to use a utility Curse or a damaging Curse. In PVE, there is always arguments about which Warlock has "Curse of the Elements Duty." With the introduction of the "Bane" magical effect, now Curses can now be entirely in the realm of utility. Now, however, Curses are amazingly narrow. There is only Curse of Weakness, Curse of Tongues, and Curse of the Elements. I think Curses need a larger range of choices and abilities, rather than simply using Curse of the Elements for it's DPS increase. The biggest one that comes to mind is Curse of Exhaustion. It is such a useful Curse, I think it deserves to be made baseline. Though I think two or so more curses could be added, though all I can think of are the rather interesting curses used in Molten Core.
3. Demonology. Demonology is currently my Warlock's preferred Spec, both for PVE and PVP, and it was the spec I leveled in. It's a very familiar and fun spec for me, and I'm sure I'll continue to use the old Felguard in Cataclysm. I do think there's some significant room to expand, though. The first is the Hand of Gul'dan ability, which seems like a decent ability, but it seems to dominate so much of the currently sparse Demonology tree. It may seem a strange thing to get upset by, but it does. Moreover, currently the level 10 ability granted by becoming a Demonologist is the ability to summon a Felguard, his old place in the talent tree taken up by the talent Inferno, letting a Demonologist cast Hellfire while moving. I don't think any simple level 10 Warlock is capable of handling the great powers of the Felguard, nor should he be allowed such a privilege. A Warlock should be able to experience the joys of earning and using multiple Demons. At the very least, the old Blueberry, the Void walker, should be the leveling pet for a decent time. Again, this may seem odd to be upset at, but I am.
Besides these, though, the Demonology tree looks strong and healthy. Molten Core keeps a Warlock switching between casting Shadowbolt and Incinerate, but now quick Incinerate blasts are more valuable because of Impending Doom, which reduces the cooldown on Metamorphosis. Demonic Pact still keeps our Spellpower high, and with the, hopeful, addition of Demon Bolt into our rotation, Demonology will be a powerful yet skillful Warlock to play. Yet, I think two abilities still need considerable tweaking.
The first is Demonic Empowerment, which is a crucial ability, really is just a button to push on cooldown with no real visible effect. Its biggest issue is that while it has an effect for each Demon, the only Warlock able to get this ability is a Demonologist, and he will only use a Felguard. Its effect for the Felguard is to simply make him big, red and scary, and increases attack speed, and makes him immune to crowd control. It is essentially a copy of the Beast Master's Bestial Wrath, but at least the Hunter's version improves their own attack power as well. Although Demonic Empowerment works, it touches me as too boring. This isn't a critically broken spell, but it could stand to be improved somehow.
The other issue, however, I think does require more consideration, and that is the Felguard himself. He is currently one of the most boring and simplistic pets in the entire game. He can simply charge, taunt, cleave, and build up a passive attack power bonus. While I love the big lug, he doesn't do anything but smash an enemy. With the improvements made to all the other minions, giving the Voidwalker a specific taunt and a damaging ability, the Succubus a push back effect, and the Imp a new DoT, the Felguard deserves to have at least have a full set of abilities he may use. Perhaps he could be kept within the Warrior theme, allow him to give a debuff of some kind, like a Hamstring or Disarm ability, or perhaps make Demonic Frenzy more powerful, but at the cost of it being a cooldown the Warlock has to initiate.
The last part of Demonology that certainly needs alot of attention and change is Metamorphosis. This signature ability is what separates a De

get from a great church experience. Again, with no real “stage fright”, having to deliver a sermon every week would not have been a problem. There have been times that I wanted to be part of that and thought I had what it would take. However, the vow of poverty was a deal breaker… I like shoes way too much for that.
6 – A ventriloquist
I recently had a weird flashback to childhood, remembering spending time in front of the mirror trying to talk without moving my lips. I thought it was just a sad “only child” thing I did, at a time when we only had 12 TV channels to choose from and 1 TV in the house, but then came a memory of actually thinking I could cut it as a ventriloquist. Thank god I didn’t follow that dream! Ironically, as an adult, I get easily creeped out by ventriloquist dummies, so I can only suspect I was more inspired by Shari Lewis and Lambchop more than any of the other ventriloquist teams of that era.
5 – A pharmacist
After working part time in “your friendly neighbourhood pharmacy” throughout my high school years, one can’t help but get influenced a little by one’s surroundings and the people we work with. For a while, pharmacist was on the list, but let’s just say that my best courses at school were pointing more toward a future in business than sciences, so that fell off the radar.
4 – A hairstylist
Given the amount of time I spent on my hair in the 1980’s and 1990’s, how can one NOT consider hairstylist as a career option.
3 – A manager
My professional career was built on a slow and steady journey, gradually climbing the corporate ladder with the goal of eventually becoming a manager. I was very lucky in that I had received 5 opportunities to “act” for a few months in a management position due to temporary vacancies. After 5 times of trying very hard to make it work, but struggling, often feeling like a fish swimming against the current, I concluded it was not for me. It was great experience and I received compliments on my abilities as a manager but to be honest, I don’t think I was a natural at it.
2 – A Wal-Mart Greeter
With only a few years left to retirement, some people have already been kidding that because of my sunny disposition and relentless cheerfulness, I should become a Wal-Mart Greeter when I retire. I admit, if I ever needed some extra cash, that would probably be the most natural way to go for me, but I have a feeling retirement will be all about what is #1 on the list:
1 – A writer
The idea of becoming a writer only really hit me in my university years even though I always had an easy time expressing myself in writing. This blog has really been a source of inspiration in itself in demonstrating to me that what I can do here is just the tip of the iceberg of what awaits when I can do this full time. I really look forward to it!
Ironically, public servant was not in my Top 10, but in retrospect, I worked for a very dynamic Agency that offered challenging assignments that pushed me beyond my limits and my comfort zones, which helped me become the person I am today. I am proud of several accomplishments to which I contributed while working with great people, some of whom I know will be lifelong friends. For those reasons, and many more, when looking back, I wouldn’t have changed a thing.

What significant contribution did Alan Lloyd Hodgkin make in collaboration with Andrew F. Huxley regarding nerve impulses
------------correct----------------------
Alan Lloyd Hodgkin Biography (1914-1998)
Alan Lloyd Hodgkin was best known for his work in defining the electrical andchemical characteristics of nerve impulses. Along with Andrew F. Huxley he performed experiments on the nerve fibers of squid and described the nerve impulses with a series of mathematical equations. For their research in this area, which resulted in the ionic theory of nerve impulses , the two menshared the 1963 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine with John C. Eccles.
Hodgkin was born on February 5, 1914, in Banbury, Oxfordshire, England, to George L. and Mary Wilson Hodgkin. Hodgkin's father died in Baghdad during World War I, only a few years after his birth. Hodgkin was educated at the DownsSchool in Malvern and the Gresham School in Holt. In 1932, he entered TrinityCollege, Cambridge, where he first became interested in physiology. Hodgkinbecame a fellow at Trinity in 1936, serving as lecturer and later as assistant director of research at the physiological laboratory.
Hodgkin began studying the electrical properties of the nerve fibers in the shore crab while at Cambridge. He spent a year at the Rockefeller Institute inNew York City between 1937 and 1938, and while there he met scientists who had developed new methods for studying nerve fibers. Hodgkin brought these ideas back to Cambridge, where with Andrew Huxley he devised an experiment to test an hypothesis about nerve impulses first proposed by German physiologist Julius Bernstein .
Bernstein had hypothesized that nerve cells possess a resting or unstimulatedpotential and an action or stimulated potential. During the resting potential, he believed, the nerve cell membrane had an unequal distribution of positively and negatively charged ions, with more negative ones on the inside. During resting potential, the membrane was permeable to the positively charged ions, but the negatively charged ions could not permeate the cell membrane. When the cell was stimulated, Bernstein argued, the membrane "gates" were temporarily opened, allowing ions to pass in both directions. By using the nerve cells of the shore crab, Hodgkin was able to establish that the resting potential was due to an outward movement of potassium ions; during the action potential the cell membrane's gates allowed in the more concentrated sodium ions. He also discovered that the action potential was usually much larger than theresting potential.

Alan Lloyd Hodgkin Biography (1914-1998)
Alan Lloyd Hodgkin was best known for his work in defining the electrical andchemical characteristics of nerve impulses. Along with Andrew F. Huxley he performed experiments on the nerve fibers of squid and described the nerve impulses with a series of mathematical equations. For their research in this area, which resulted in the ionic theory of nerve impulses , the two menshared the 1963 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine with John C. Eccles.
Hodgkin was born on February 5, 1914, in Banbury, Oxfordshire, England, to George L. and Mary Wilson Hodgkin. Hodgkin's father died in Baghdad during World War I, only a few years after his birth. Hodgkin was educated at the DownsSchool in Malvern and the Gresham School in Holt. In 1932, he entered TrinityCollege, Cambridge, where he first became interested in physiology. Hodgkinbecame a fellow at Trinity in 1936, serving as lecturer and later as assistant director of research at the physiological laboratory.
Hodgkin began studying the electrical properties of the nerve fibers in the shore crab while at Cambridge. He spent a year at the Rockefeller Institute inNew York City between 1937 and 1938, and while there he met scientists who had developed new methods for studying nerve fibers. Hodgkin brought these ideas back to Cambridge, where with Andrew Huxley he devised an experiment to test an hypothesis about nerve impulses first proposed by German physiologist Julius Bernstein .
Bernstein had hypothesized that nerve cells possess a resting or unstimulatedpotential and an action or stimulated potential. During the resting potential, he believed, the nerve cell membrane had an unequal distribution of positively and negatively charged ions, with more negative ones on the inside.

n across the land and sea, to ensure that there is no deterioration in biodiversity conservation status, and that restoration increases the EU’s resilience to climate change as a key nature-based solution. Through funding from the research and innovation policy and the EU Green Deal, significant effort has been mobilised towards implementing nature-based solutions and assisting Europe’s green recovery.
Within this framework, NetworkNature, funded by the Horizon 2020 programme, is creating a resource for local, regional and international cooperation to maximise the impact and spread of nature-based solutions.
NetworkNature has recently started its second topical semester focusing on the theme of ‘Nature-based Solutions for Ecosystem Restoration’, and released a concept note on the topic. It is through this opportunity that I will be collaborating with NetworkNature to share knowledge and experiences by bringing together stakeholders from the five main target audiences, and including everyone from governments to financial organisations and businesses, civil society and individuals, from across the globe.
This is an opportunity to reflect on current principles and frameworks supporting the implementation of ecosystem restoration and promote the uptake and upscaling of restoration initiatives as a valid nature-based solution. We hope to collate evidence of the impacts of ecological restoration on biodiversity and the different dimensions that constitute wellbeing. We are interested to learn about projects that have used ecological restoration to reverse biodiversity decline and increase resilience to climate and environmental drivers. Similarly, we would like to learn about experiences using ecological restoration for place regeneration, providing new economic opportunities and educational, recreation and non-material benefits, and to address distributive, procedural and interactional injustices associated with the management of natural capital.
By sharing experiences of ecological restoration from around the world, developing collaborations and co-creating knowledge, it is possible to replicate and scale-up ecosystem restoration and to reset our relationship with nature to one that fosters stewardship and sustainable management of our natural capital.

What are some of the main environmental issues affecting ecosystems and biodiversity as mentioned in the March 2021 NetworkNature Newsletter editorial
------------correct----------------------
Editorial for March 2021 edition of NetworkNature Newsletter.
Environmental degradation impacts on the well-being of an estimated 3.2 billion people globally whilst the loss of ecosystem services leads to a reduction of more than 10% of our global economic output (UNEP, 2021). A total of 33% of marine fish stocks are overfished and around one-thirds of the world’s farmland is degraded. Trends of ecosystem degradation have also been recorded for ecosystems at regional scale, with a recent EU-wide assessment concluding that the current potential of ecosystems to deliver timber, protection against floods, crop pollination, and nature-based recreation is equal to or lower than the baseline value for 2010.
The impact on biodiversity is equally upsetting. An estimated 32 million hectares of primary and recovering forest were lost between 2010 and 2015, and approximately half the live coral cover on coral reefs has been lost since the 1870s, as indicated by the IPBES Global Assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Around 40% of all the world’s species live and breed in wetlands but the world has lost 87% of its wetlands since 1700. One out of four mammal species and an estimated 41% of the amphibians are threatened with extinction and whilst globally only a small proportion of the insect species have been evaluated, local declines of pollinator species have been recorded.
Most of us would readily accept the notion that nature is essential for human existence and good quality of life, but in using and extracting resources from the environment we have damaged its ability to sustain human communities, with benefits and burdens being disproportionately shared and experienced differently among social groups, countries, and regions.
The degradation and destruction of natural capital needs to be turned around by an equal, positive, wave of responses that transform society through short and long-term actions that drive a green recovery. In this regard, the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration 2021-2030 represents a distinct opportunity to collaborate and make meaningful headway in preventing, halting, and reversing the degradation of our planet’s ecosystems.
Action is also seen at regional and national levels, with the EU planning to propose legally binding nature restoration targets as part of its Biodiversity Strategy for 2030. The strategy calls for a stronger implementation of restoratio

What orchestras and big bands is Scott Whitfield known for his work with
------------correct----------------------
|Scott Whitfield (2005)|
|Scott Whitfield (trombonist, composer, arranger, and vocalist) is internationally recognized for his work with many contemporary big bands, including the Toshiko Akiyoshi Jazz Orchestra and the new edition of Johnny Griffin’s Big Soul Band, as well as his own Scott Whitfield Jazz Orchestras (East and West). Whitfield’s discography includes 7 recordings as leader and more than 50 recordings with other artists. In addition to his own recordings, his compositions and arrangements have been performed and recorded by such artists as Diva, Maurice Hines, The Pied Pipers, Bill Allred’s Classic Jazz Band, and Pete Petersen’s 23-strong Collection Jazz Orchestra.
A clinician and guest artist for Bach Stradivarius trombones, Whitfield has appeared throughout the world, from Australia to Zurich, sharing his expertise on trombone technique, improvisation, composition, arranging, and jazz history. He was featured as guest soloist with the United States Army Blues Jazz Ensemble at the 2007 Eastern Trombone Workshop. His transcription book “The J.J. Johnson Collection” (published by Hal Leonard) has inspired not only trombonists, but also jazz improvisers on many instruments, young and old.
Upon settling in New York in 1993, Whitfield became a member of the Nat Adderley Sextet, which also included Jimmy Cobb, Walter Booker, Vincent Herring and Rob Bargad. The group’s engagements at Sweet Basil led to fruitful associations with Nnenna Freelon, Frank Wess, Lionel Hampton, Wayne Andre, an

What actions did John Kerry take to confront the Reagan and Bush administrations, and what were the implications of those actions
------------correct----------------------
threatens us as a nation, shallow pride which feeds off fear, and mostly from the promises which have proven so deceiving these past ten years." Change "ten" to "four," and you get the idea. The rest of the essay is stunningly humble, and it is simply a call to be citizens with eyes and ears open, to allow that maybe the powerful are more concerned with keeping power than with admitting error. And it is horribly, frighteningly prescient. What people forget about Kerry's protest days is that he was defending the lives of soldiers and that he was right.
Kerry vs. Reagan: When Kerry faced down the Reagan administration in his dogged pursuit of the Contra-drug connection, he was a freshman Senator taking on one of the most popular Presidents in American history. Instead of backing down from repeated threats to his political career, Kerry had his staff stay on the case like a viper injecting venom into your leg. They would have had to cut off his head in order to get him to stop, and he stayed on it until he revealed that the Reagan administration allowed the Contras to smuggle cocaine into the U.S. in order to fund their CIA-led "war" against the legally-elected Sandinistas in Nicaragua. (And thus helping to cause the crack epidemic.) Kerry was called a conspiracy theorist, said to be interfering with other drug cases, and impugned throughout the media. But the part that rarely got told is that he was right.
Kerry vs. Bush I: When Kerry went after the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, which was involved in laundering the Contra drug money, funneling money from the U.S. to Saddam Hussein (when he was our beloved dictator), and supporting illegal arms trade with terrorists and drug lords (including Afghanistan), it was his first chance to take on the Bush dynasty. When Bush I was in power, the administration and the CIA overlooked the crimes of BCCI, possibly because the bank was intimately involved in the financial dealings of the Bush family. Kerry had already kicked ass on the savings and loan scandals of the 1980s, so why not fuck with George H.W. Bush if 41 was fucking over the good of the country and the world? He brought down BCCI, and he cut off a vital funding source for terrorists. Again, Kerry was bucking the will of Democrats in Congress, as well as a Republican administration, in order to do what he knew was right.
Listen closely and tell anyone you know who is still thinking about voting for Bush: has Bush ever, personally, faced down anyone other than with a chant of "Drink, drink, drink"? Has he ever gone against someone who was really, truly powerful in order to place the good of the people above his own good? No. Heroes do that - they don't care what's in their way - they will face down evil, no matter how powerful. And they don't bother with those who are too weak to fight. It's why the latest news from Iraq fanned the fire: those in charge have screwed us over again, and Kerry's ready to bring the superhero costume out. Call him "the Winter Soldier."
Kerry's done a fuck of a lot more than pull a guy out of a river. And the fact that America doesn't know that says a great deal about how we negotiate our desolate political landscape

The evening also included an opportunity for party-goers to learn more about Big Brothers Big Sisters and the work they do on the Cape. Currently, the organization has 80 littles awaiting mentors. They are particularly in need of male mentors.
“We are so grateful for Guapo’s, Nauset Disposal, CCBM, Bayside Tent and the many other businesses who donated to make this night a huge success!”, said JR Mell, Regional Director for BBBSCCI. “This event raised much needed funding to support our mission and was the perfect venue to kick off our “30 Guys in 30 Days” campaign. In one night we were able to sign up 4 male volunteers who stepped up to make a difference in the life of a child right here on the Cape!”
The National Margarita Day party is part of GUAPO’s long-standing “GUAPO’s GIVES” initiative, through which they raise thousands of dollars annually for local non-profit groups. GUAPO’s is located at 136 Route 6A (Staples Plaza) in Orleans with a second seasonal location in Brewster.

What are some dietary components recommended to aid in losing 34 pounds
------------correct----------------------
Weight loss is one of the biggest problems worldwide. In this busy era, the chances of gaining weight have been increased due to our diet and routines. There are diverse ways of losing weight, which helps in weight loss in no time. But such plans work for very little time as quick weight loss in turns gives quick weight gain in the future. As the saying goes, "Slow and steady wins the race."
Let’s have a brief discussion on tips to lose 34 pounds.
Follow a Strict Diet
To lose 34 pounds is a big target to achieve. So, the essential step to start weight loss is to adopt a strict diet plan.
Say no to calories. Avoid processed food, bakery items, potatoes chips, cookies, etc. as they are rich in calories. The calorie intake should be limited, not banned, because zero calories are also not good for our body. So get ready and fill up your kitchen with low calories items like grains, vegetables, fruits, etc.
This is the best way to lose your weight as having a protein-enriched breakfast helps in reducing your cravings for foods. It gives you a feeling of a full stomach. Eggs, dairy, fish, meat, and poultry are some vital protein-enriched items you need to add to your diet plan.
Fiber is another essential constituent to add to your diet plan chart. Fiber slows down the process of digestion, which in turn makes you feel full for a long time. Thus your food intake can be reduced. Nuts, seeds, banana, bread, and grains are some essential fiber-enriche

Our Villas (Villa Roja and Villa Azul) are next door to each other, are frontline to the stunning El Valle 18 hole golf course and ideal for families and friends who like to holiday together but still enjoy their own privacy. These Villas are the large 3 double bedroom types (Algabas) on a 760m2 plot. They each have a large private pool (10m x 5m). (Be aware of other 3 Bed Villas on El Valle (Alcors) on a plot of 490m2 with smaller pool).
All bedrooms also have the pull-out option of an extra single bed, as all rooms are large enough, which may help families wishing to share with others, or golfers to spread the cost a little bit further.
Bedroom 1: The Master bedroom has a King size bed that can also be set up as twin beds and also has the pull-out option of an extra single bed. There is a large en-suite and walk-in wardrobe. Linen is provided and there are two bedside cabinets and lamps. This bedroom is particularly luxurious as it has 2 sets of patio doors that open up onto the terrace and pool area and a walk-in dressing area.
The en-suite includes a whirlpool bath, double basins, shower, bidet and wc.
Bedroom 2: This bedroom has a King size bed that can also be set up as twin beds. Linen is provided and there is a bedside cabinet and lamp. This bedroom has patio doors that open up onto the putting green and terraced area at the side of the villa.
Bedroom 3: This bedroom has a King size bed that can also be set up as twin beds and also has the pull-out option of an extra single bed. Linen is provided and there is a bedside cabinet and lamp. This bedroom has a large double window that opens up onto the front of the villa.
|Further details outdoors|
The luxury of the villa is extended outside. By the side of the lounge area there is a fabulously large covered conservatory, you can choose to sit and relax here on the rattan suite, whilst being cooled by the 3 ceiling fans and sipping a long drink in the heat of the day. We have a Hot Tub under the conservatory to relax in if you don´t fancy the pool or for those cooler evenings. You could try your hand at table tennis on the full size table available. You could opt to sit under the other seating area by the pool and watch the golfers go by, maybe picking up the odd tip to try on your next round.
You also have your own private putting green practice area to the side of the villa. It has 5 sunken holes as well as undulations to really test your putting skills. We´ve provided adult, junior and toddler putters so that you can start them early or have a good practice before setting off for your round! Haven´t seen this in any other villa and adds an extra dimension to your family or golfing holiday. The putting green can also be used to play bowls on, with our real weighted carpet(mini) bowls!
The rear of the property overlooks the 12th hole (par 3) and the fantastic tranquil view of the neighbouring mountain range. Golf clubs - For those irregular/fair-weather golfers or those wishing to just experience the El Valle course without the cost of taking out their own set of clubs, we have provided 9 sets (7 adult(1 left handed), 2 junior plus a putter/wedge for a toddler) for use during your stay.
If you want a large extended family/friends holiday....book both villas together and get the bonus of all facilities in each - together the 2 villas can accommodate 16 guests.

------------question-----------------------
What factors help narrow down a person's career options according to the text
------------correct----------------------
I would like to think that my parents did a good job in raising me, providing all the positive reinforcement a young boy needs, including the popular statement from page 826, paragraph 7f, of the parenting handbook, “Honey, when you grow up, you can be anything you want to be”.
How’s that for a torturous open-ended statement for Libra child, facing a lifetime of weighing the pros and the cons of career planning? No pressure there!
Fortunately, life deals us a variety of hands that help shape that wide, open-ended statement into something that gradually narrows into what might seem like a career path. Factors like interest, talent, perseverance and perhaps even things like eye-hand coordination (or lack thereof) gradually eliminate a few options, bit by bit, without really trying too hard.
It is clear that hockey player, pro golfer and baseball player were never on the table for me. When it came to natural affinity, I don’t think I was cut out to be a scientist since Physics was one of my worst subjects.
However, I did inherit (if one can actually inherit these) a head for numbers from my Dad and an affinity for creativity and language from my Mom so I was indeed lucky with the doors that were open to me.
Here they are: The Top 10 Things I Wanted to Be When I Grew Up
10 – An elevator operator
Yes, I am of a vintage that remembers a time when people were hired to drive elevators. The elevators of yesteryear were not fully automated like today, as the doors needed a human to open and close them. I remember visits to a big downtown department store when I was very young and thought driving an elevator all day would be the coolest thing and that the people operating them had the coolest job EVER! I admit that I was also impressed by the very smart elevator operator uniforms. Unfortunately the fully automated elevator came in shortly thereafter and dashed those dreams… darn technology!
9 – A dentist
This one lasted for a LONG time and I believe it was inspired from Hermey, the elf in the Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer Christmas Special on television. I remember my Grade 7 composition on “What I Want To Be When I Grow Up” was indeed on the theme of dentistry. To prepare for that composition I spent a few afternoons at the library reading everything available on the topic. The research was hard core (well, about as hard core and scientific as a 12 year old’s research can get) and I knocked that composition out of the park. However, I spent so much time in the orthodontist’s chair in my teens getting my bottom teeth straightened, I lost interest.
8 – A corporate trainer
As an adult, I am very fortunate in not being prone to much “stage fright” when it comes to public speaking. That being the case, when I have had been asked to deliver training, I always thought it was a huge rush (and an even greater privilege) in seeing light bulb moments in the eyes of the audience members when they pick up on the concepts that are being conveyed. Also, there is no greater compliment than when I meet a former student weeks or months later who says that something I said stuck with them and that they were able to apply it, or that I took a complex issue and really made it easy to understand.
I haven’t ruled this one out yet… there is still time.
7 – A priest
There have been many soft signs over the years that have indicated I might have been right for this job. I believe I am good with people, a good listener, naturally inclined toward encouraging people and have known the value of the “spiritual tune-up” one can

What transformation has John Kerry undergone during his campaign in response to the war in Iraq and Afghanistan
------------correct----------------------
John Kerry - Superhero:
In the vicious end of days in this campaign, so much gets lost in the caterwauling of the media. Here's something that's happened in the last couple of days: John Kerry has found the last piece of the puzzle, the final cause to push to the end of the battle. If you've listened to Kerry since the dual revelations of the missing 760,000 pounds of high-powered explosives from a known ammo dump and the coming request for an additional $70 billion dollars for Iraq and Afghanistan, Kerry has become the man we've all heard about - the unstoppable crusader for what's right against however powerful the forces of evil may be. Kerry has been tough-guy posturing for most of the campaign, and it's been a ludicrous sight. How many animals must be hunted and killed in order for a Democrat to look strong on defense? As Bradley Whitford said on Bill Maher's show last week, "How many times does a guy have to be shot in the ass running across rice paddies in Vietnam in order to look tougher than the cheerleader from Andover?"
Here's the deal - what's been missing from the entire Kerry campaign is just how tough a motherfucker John Kerry really, actually is, and it's got jackshit to do with hunting geese and killing the Vietcong. Kerry is a superhero, the kind of valiant son of a bitch who doesn't give a rat's ass about his own life in order to make the lives of others better. It's his post-Vietnam life that makes him a superhero. You don't know how much a superhero the man in the cape is by his origins. You know a superhero by his deeds. And if Kerry loses, it'll be because his campaign refused to acknowledge just how kick-ass Kerry has been since his final purple heart (and if Kerry loses, adviser Bob Shrum, who, in essence, said the public was too stupid to understand Kerry's accomplishments, should be strung up by his balls and batted around like a pinata by the Democratic party leadership until he bursts open and showers everyone with his innards).
Yeah, yeah, this is gonna be a down-on-the-knees-Kerry-supportin-hummer of an entry, but the Rude Pundit keeps talking to people who sigh and say, "I guess I'm gonna vote for Bush" because they can't bring themselves to vote for Kerry. They see him as weak. They see him as a flip-flopper. In other words, they see him as the projection of self that Bush has imposed on Kerry. In other words, these voters are too blinded by the glow that emits from the crown on Bush's head to believe that they own the democracy.
Kerry vs. Nixon: When Kerry helped organize the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, he was directly confronting a hegemonic ideology in the country that said the people must blindly follow their leaders. Kerry, villified at the time with incredible viciousness, did not back down from charges of treason and heresy. Check out the end of the book The New Soldier, which Kerry co-wrote and edited in order to talk about what the young men returning from Vietnam had confronted in the name of "freedom" from Communism. The book is, ironically enough, mostly reprinted on an anti-Kerry site. Kerry writes, "We are asking America to turn from false glory, hollow victory, fabricated foreign threats, fear which

ose nerve fibers are larger than those of most organisms. Hodgkinand Huxley were able to develop a method to study these fibers using microelectrodes, and they were able to confirm the results of their earlier experiment. Their progress, however, came to a halt during World War II, when Hodgkinworked on radar systems for aircraft for the Air Ministry. Hodgkin and Huxleywere back in Cambridge in 1945, and they formed a small research group to pursue their pre-war investigations into nerve fibers.
In 1951, Hodgkin and his colleagues published the results of their research.They found that the membrane is permeable only to specific ions during the resting potential, because of the differing concentrations of potassium and sodium. The concentration of the positively charged sodium ions is greater on the outside of the membrane and the concentration of negative potassium ions higher on the inside during resting potential. During the action potential, thenegative and positive ions travel through the membrane, so that the interiorcharge becomes positive and the exterior negative. This is followed by an equilibrium charge, then a return to the resting potential charge state. All this happens in milliseconds.
The work done by Hodgkin and Huxley which was most responsible for bringing them to the attention of the Nobel Prize committee was the development of a series of mathematical formulae they published in 1952. The purpose of these equations was to synthesize the experimental information then available about the electrical and chemical nature of nerve transmissions. Their goal was to analyze and predict each stage in the passage of the nerve cell membrane fromresting to action potential. They were awarded the 1963 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine, which they shared with John C. Eccles, an Australian who advanced the British team's findings by showing what happens to nerve impulsestransmitted across the synapses, or intersections, between nerve cells.
Hodgkin was appointed Foulerton Research Professor of the Royal Society in 1952, and was awarded the Royal Medal in 1958. He was John Humphrey Plummer Professor of Biophysics at Cambridge from 1970 to 1981, president of the MarineBiological Association from 1966 to 1976, and a master of Trinity College.
Hodgkin was married in 1944 to Marion Rous, the daughter of American Nobel Laureate Peyton Rous. The couple met during Hodgkin's year at the Rockefeller Institute in New York. They had four children Hodgkin died December 20,1998

------------question-----------------------
What are some of the key changes and improvements the author hopes to see for Warlocks in the Cataclysm expansion
------------correct----------------------
It seems to be an amazingly exciting time in the Cataclysm beta, with classes everywhere being improved and redesigned. Paladins now have Holy Power, Shaman can duel wield at level 10, Priests can make shadowy apparitions of themselves, Hunters have focus, and so on. Pity I'm not part of it. Yet, I see Warlock lagging far behind. There has been very little change to the Warlock trees, and the Soul Shard system in particular seems to be in a ludicrously low level of development. There are only six uses for Soul Shards right now, and gathering them is just as much a hassle as it is today. I believe there are still many changes to come, but in this early stage of development, I've decided to post my wish list for the Cataclysm Warlock.
1. Soul Shards. I hope so deeply that this mechanic comes from the muck of development as a shining and brilliant mechanic, the envy of Spellcasters everywhere. As of right now, the theory is that Soul Shards should be used as a resource, consumed by the spell Soulburn, to alter spells. Yet, right now, the only spells that are affected are the summon Demon spells, making them instant cast, Drain Life, which reduces casting speed on its target, Teleporting to the Demonic Circle, which increases your movement speed once you've teleported, making Soul fire an instant cast and Searing Pain guaranteed to be a critical strike. Very minor changes. The issue right now really is how to balance situational use with rotational use. Some Warlocks hold that anything less than a damage increase makes this new mechanic pointless. I, in fact, believe the opposite. Right now the theory goes that a Warlock should "Consume 3 Soul Shards" every boss encounter, while I think the philosophy should instead be that a Warlock, in a pure DPS fight or a, pardon the crude vernacular, "Tank-and-spank" boss, should not have to use any Soul Shards. It should be a mechanic used when under pressure, when rotations break down and a Warlock needs to make a snap choice what to do. Yes, a Warlock won't use their Soul Shards every fight, but when they do it should be a rather impressive show of skill and ability to use it right.
Moreover, I'm personally bothered by the current way to regain Soul Shards, which is to either use Drain Soul when a creature is about to die, or Soul Harvest to regain life and Soul Shards. Both feel very clumsy, and were the hallmarks of the problems of the old Soul Shard system. A crucial part of a class's resource system shouldn't be replenished by spells, it should be an innate mechanic that regenerates on its own. I believe the current issue on this revolves around the fear that Warlocks will simply break combat to regenerate Soul Shards, then return to battle with a fresh set of abilities, and while having to manually gain Soul Shards helps this problem, I still think it needs much more polish and design change, so that it will be an automatic process.
2. Curses. Warlocks have always had a difficult decision to make, both in PVE and PVP, over whether to use a utility Curse or a damaging Curse. In PVE, there is always arguments about which Warlock has "Curse of the Elements Duty." With the introduction of the "Bane" magical effect, now Curses can now be entirely in the realm of utility. Now, however, Curses are amazingly narrow. There is only Curse of Weakness, Curse of Tongues, and Curse of the Elements. I think Curses need a larger range of choices and abilities, rather than simply using Curse of the Elements for it's DPS increase. The biggest one that comes to mind is Curse of Exhaustion. It is such a useful Curse, I think it deserves to be made baseline. Though I think two or so more curses could be added, though all I can think of are the rather interesting curses used in Molten Core.
3. Demonology. Demonology is currently my Warlock's preferred Spec, both for PVE and PVP, and it was the spec I leveled in. It's a very familiar and fun spec for me, and I'm sure I'll continue to use the old Felguard in Cataclysm. I do think there's some significant room to expand, though. The first is the Hand of Gul'dan ability, which seems like a decent ability, but it seems to dominate so much of the currently sparse Demonology tree. It may seem a strange thing to get upset by, but it does. Moreover, currently the level 10 ability granted by becoming a Demonologist is the ability to summon a Felguard, his old place in the talent tree taken up by the talent Inferno, letting a Demonologist cast Hellfire while moving. I don't think any simple level 10 Warlock is capable of handling the great powers of the Felguard, nor should he be allowed such a privilege. A Warlock should be able to experience the joys of earning and using multiple Demons. At the very least, the old Blueberry, the Void walker, should be the leveling pet for a decent time. Again, this may seem odd to be upset at, but I am.
Besides these, though, the Demonology tree looks strong and healthy. Molten Core keeps a Warlock switching between casting Shadowbolt and Incinerate, but now quick Incinerate blasts are more valuable because of Impending Doom, which reduces the cooldown on Metamorphosis. Demonic Pact still keeps our Spellpower high, and with the, hopeful, addition of Demon Bolt into our rotation, Demonology will be a powerful yet skillful Warlock to play. Yet, I think two abilities still need considerable tweaking.
The first is Demonic Empowerment, which is a crucial ability, really is just a button to push on cooldown with no real visible effect. Its biggest issue is that while it has an effect for each Demon, the only Warlock able to get this ability is a Demonologist, and he will only use a Felguard. Its effect for the Felguard is to simply make him big, red and scary, and increases attack speed, and makes him immune to crowd control. It is essentially a copy of the Beast Master's Bestial Wrath, but at least the Hunter's version improves their own attack power as well. Although Demonic Empowerment works, it touches me as too boring. This isn't a critically broken spell, but it could stand to be improved somehow.
The other issue, however, I think does require more consideration, and that is the Felguard himself. He is currently one of the most boring and simplistic pets in the entire game. He can simply charge, taunt, cleave, and build up a passive attack power bonus. While I love the big lug, he doesn't do anything but smash an enemy. With the improvements made to all the other minions, giving the Voidwalker a specific taunt and a damaging ability, the Succubus a push back effect, and the Imp a new DoT, the Felguard deserves to have at least have a full set of abilities he may use. Perhaps he could be kept within the Warrior theme, allow him to give a debuff of some kind, like a Hamstring or Disarm ability, or perhaps make Demonic Frenzy more powerful, but at the cost of it being a cooldown the Warlock has to initiate.
The last part of Demonology that certainly needs alot of attention and change is Metamorphosis. This signature ability is what separates a De

It seems to be an amazingly exciting time in the Cataclysm beta, with classes everywhere being improved and redesigned. Paladins now have Holy Power, Shaman can duel wield at level 10, Priests can make shadowy apparitions of themselves, Hunters have focus, and so on. Pity I'm not part of it. Yet, I see Warlock lagging far behind. There has been very little change to the Warlock trees, and the Soul Shard system in particular seems to be in a ludicrously low level of development. There are only six uses for Soul Shards right now, and gathering them is just as much a hassle as it is today. I believe there are still many changes to come, but in this early stage of development, I've decided to post my wish list for the Cataclysm Warlock.
1. Soul Shards. I hope so deeply that this mechanic comes from the muck of development as a shining and brilliant mechanic, the envy of Spellcasters everywhere. As of right now, the theory is that Soul Shards should be used as a resource, consumed by the spell Soulburn, to alter spells. Yet, right now, the only spells that are affected are the summon Demon spells, making them instant cast, Drain Life, which reduces casting speed on its target, Teleporting to the Demonic Circle, which increases your movement speed once you've teleported, making Soul fire an instant cast and Searing Pain guaranteed to be a critical strike. Very minor changes. The issue right now really is how to balance situational use with rotational use. Some Warlocks hold that anything less than a damage increase makes this new mechanic pointless. I, in fact, believe the opposite. Right now the theory goes that a Warlock should "Consume 3 Soul Shards" every boss encounter, while I think the philosophy should instead be that a Warlock, in a pure DPS fight or a, pardon the crude vernacular, "Tank-and-spank" boss, should not have to use any Soul Shards. It should be a mechanic used when under pressure, when rotations break down and a Warlock needs to make a snap choice what to do. Yes, a Warlock won't use their Soul Shards every fight, but when they do it should be a rather impressive show of skill and ability to use it right.
Moreover, I'm personally bothered by the current way to regain Soul Shards, which is to either use Drain Soul when a creature is about to die, or Soul Harvest to regain life and Soul Shards. Both feel very clumsy, and were the hallmarks of the problems of the old Soul Shard system. A crucial part of a class's resource system shouldn't be replenished by spells, it should be an innate mechanic that regenerates on its own. I believe the current issue on this revolves around the fear that Warlocks will simply break combat to regenerate Soul Shards, then return to battle with a fresh set of abilities, and while having to manually gain Soul Shards helps this problem, I still think it needs much more polish and design change, so that it will be an automatic process.
2. Curses. Warlocks have always had a difficult decision to make, both in PVE and PVP, over whether to use a utility Curse or a damaging Curse.

Living walls, or vertical gardens, are the latest great design craze and have been popping up all over the place. While they are increasingly popular in businesses and public areas, these living works of art are also especially handy for people living in small spaces where space for plants is limited. Though they look gorgeous, aesthetics aren’t the only reason for putting up one of these babies: having plenty of green plants around can also reduce stress, increase wellbeing, purify and humidify the air, and dampen noise pollution! Getting a living wall professionally designed and installed can cost a fortune… luckily, this DIY version is quick, easy, and cheap!
The Difficulty: Medium – you need to be familiar with some basic tools, and a considerable amount of strength is needed when things get heavy
The Time Commitment: Done in a day
The Look: Rustic and chunky, modern and on-trend
The Cost: Less than $100 (you’ll spend the most on plants)
Would I do it Again? Absolutely.
What you’ll need:
- Shipping Pallet (we got ours on the side of the road, outside a warehouse)
- Thin wood or plastic roughly the size of the back of the pallet
- Landscaping fabric
- Plastic sheeting
- Staple gun
- Indoor potting soil
- 3inch eyehooks
- Heavy weight bearing metal chain
Remove the slats from the top of the pallet. This can be a little tricky, but patience and creativity will get you there!
Cover the back of the pallet with the thin piece of wood, and nail into place. Then, cover the entire back of the pallet with the plastic sheeting and use the staple gun to secure. This will protect your walls from moisture!

monologist from all other Warlocks. It's powerful, it grants us amazing abilities, and it of course makes one look like one of the greatest villains of all time. Yet, despite it's obvious greatness, many Warlocks criticize Metamorphosis for being simply a cosmetic change, only really increasing damage done, because the abilities granted to a Metamorphosed Warlock are all but worthless. A taunt, a melee attack, a charge and an immolation aura really are only useful for a tank in melee combat, exactly what a Warlock doesn't want to find himself in. So this ability needs to change what it gives, but more over affect the abilities a Warlock already uses. Recently, Tree of Life was changed to work like Metamorphosis, but instead of adding more abilities it changed the ones they currently use. This approach should be taken to Metamorphosis, perhaps going so far as to make the entire rotation change. I'd like to see some significant changes; Curroptions that work more like instant blasts of shadow magic, dealing the same damage but in a much smaller time, Shadowbolts that fire three in one shot, to hit multiple or the same target, Immolates that burst and make new Immolate ticks, Soul Fires becoming spammable, and so forth. I would love that Metamorphosis isn't just a visual or damage dealing change, but a complete and total change to the Warlock, that Metamorphosis should be an amazing thing to use.
4. Affliction. Early in my raiding career, I switched to Affliction because Demonology was simply not a raiding spec. I did both Naxxramas and Ulduar as an Affliction Warlock, and I must admit it is a very fun spec. It's the oldest viable DPS spec for Warlocks, back when Demonology was only for leveling and Destruction was for the odd Warlock who wanted to be like a Mage and endlessly fire Shadowbolt. Ironic, as now Affliction's worst criticism is that it is the new Shadowbolt spammer. Yet, it is still a very solid spec, keeping four DoTs, Haunt, Unstable Affliction, Curroption and Curse of Agony, up at any one time, filling in the duration of those with Shadowbolt volleys. Long ago, the pet of choice was ambiguous for Affliction Warlocks, where some would say the optimal Demon was, in fact, the Doomguard. Now, an Affliction Warlock has his lovable and loyal Felhunter at his side. With the inclusion Soul Swap, nearly all the broken aspects of Affliction are rested. I think the only means of improvement for Affliction really are to add new procs, ways to keep an Affliction Warlock from becoming too locked into a routine. The only real such thing Affliction has is Nightfall, a small chance from a Curroption tick to have an instant cast Shadowbolt, and it both procs far too little to make any meaningful impact on Affliction's rotation, and only makes what you were doing anyway an instant cast. Almost every Nightfall proc I received while playing Affliction was instantly used because I was in the middle of casting Shadowbolt anyway.
A few new interesting talents could really make Affliction a fun yet stable spec to play as a Warlock. I can't help but look at the new Shadow Priest talents for inspiration, as the two are nearly identical; setting up DoTs then filling in the time between them with a powerful Shadow attack. Currently, Shadow Priests have some pretty interesting talents, particularly Shadowy Apparition, which randomly will make a ghost of yourself to attack an enemy. Affliction could make some great use out of abilities like this, or perhaps even non-DPS abilities, like the Shadow Priest's Dispersion, which can add some utility without necessarily increasing damage. All in all, Affliction simply needs some stirring up, a few abilities to add some interesting mechanics, and Affliction will be nigh perfect.
5. Destruction. Between the time I switched from Demonology, and settled on Affliction for raiding, I went with the standard Warlock spec: Destruction. Unfortunately, what I found was not pleasing. I found a spec that played more like a castrated Mage than any Warlock. I would dare to guess that 2/3 of all my casts were Incineration. The rotation is astoundingly simple; Start with Immolate, then with the Glyph of Conflagrate, instantly cast Conflagrate, which won't consume the Immolate, then gain the Backdraft effect, making your first Chaos Bolt quickly, along with two quick Incinerates, then...you simply keep casting Incinerates until Immolate is nearly gone, then Conflagrate, backdrafting everything over again. No cooldowns, no random procs, no real strategy. My favorite looking ability, Chaos Bolt, is relegated to just a green Incinerate. It's such a shame. I think what is required to make Destruction simply a decent spec is to give Destruction some depth, a way to keep a Destruction Warlock having to know what is going on, to separate a skillful player from one who simply pushes the buttons. I can't help but feel that Searing Pain could have a place in a new Destruction, an ability to fit between Chaos Bolt and Incinerate. Perhaps there could be a way to give Searing Pain a value above Incinerate, maybe even have Searing Pain have a high Critical Strike damage, so any proc dealing with Critical Strike would favor Searing Pain as opposed to just continuing to cast Incinerate. I also need to express my disappointment with Glyph of Conflagrate, a Glyph that makes so much difference, yet none at all. On the one hand, it makes it so that Conflagrate doesn't consume the DoT of Immolate, so you can use it both before and after casting Immolate. It essentially makes Conflagrate into a fancy Fireblast. Yet, while this is a significant change, in practicality, it is almost no difference. The cooldown of Conflagrate is the same as the duration of Immolate, meaning that the fact that it can be cast both before and after casting Immolate, this only affects your rotation once. Essentially, with the glyph, you get one free Conflagrate at the beginning of a rotation. Then, you'd only be able to Conflagrate at the end of each Immolate rotation, which is how the original spell was designed. The original spell was designed to, I believe, add a level of skill to when a Warlock should cast it, waiting till the very last second of Immolate's DoT. Many Warlocks now ask for the Glyph to be baseline for the Conflagrate spell, but I think it should be the opposite; the Glyph should simply go away completely. Conflagrate should be used skillfully, watching the last bit of Immolate, thinking about how many more Incinerates you can cast before you Conflagrate. I think with those two major changes, Destruction will change from the beginner's easy spec to a decent spec that can be used skillfully.
That's it. My thoughts and feelings, my hopes and dreams for my favorite class in the game. I hope my thoughts at least coincide with those of the developers, and the things I hope to see will come to pass. I do hope it was at least something interesting for you, the reader, to read, despite how long it may of been.
Until next the stars align, and the portals can be opened

What amenities are available in the lounges at Heathrow Airport for travelers looking to relax between flights
------------correct----------------------
The city of London is a global epicenter of travel. I have shared a guide on how to get from the airport to central London. Thanks to its convenient location, this sees many transit aviation passengers. With the many millions of travelers and long haul travel involved, this leaves the need for cool lounges to relax in. With that in mind I am sharing a guide below on London Heathrow Airport showers, lounges and other facilities perfect for stress-free flying.
These facilities are available across popular lounges on the Heathrow Airport of London. All these centers are equipped with global standards of comfort and amenities to relish. If you don’t have a membership you can also purchase a day pass for the lounges.
Heathrow Airport has 4 different terminals, starting from T2 to T5 (Terminal 1 is currently closed to make way for the much debated T2 expansion). All these are well connected via free shuttle trains and buses around the airport. All the terminals offer executive lounges with some located inside the security premises and inaccessible for transit passengers. There are also plenty of Heathrow airport lounges with showers, bars and sleeping areas.
Heathrow Airport Shower Lounges
London Heathrow Airport maintains a global status of the city and backs all the necessities in terms of lounges, shower rooms, and hotels for all travelers. These are paid in most cases, while some only require airline passes.
- Sky Team Lounge: For an economy class traveler, Terminal 4 of Heathrow Airport offers the ever-reliable SkyTeam Lounge. Open from 5 am to 10 pm daily, travelers can get rid of any jet lag with a nice and soothing shower. Other amenities such as free WiFi, Games Room, serving of alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverages are available. The lounge is only accessible for departure and transit passengers from the terminal, and 3 hours stay cost 29 Pounds per person.
- Plaza Premium Lounge Heathrow: It is a popular option for travelers at Heathrow Airport. This lounge-chain is present across all terminals of the airport, offering shower options, apart from the paid spa. The reasonably priced lounge charges 40 Pounds for 2 hours and remains open from 5 am to 11 pm daily.
- Club Aspire: Opened in 2016, this lounge in Terminal 3 is among the most popular ones in the airport. Long-transit and travelers can make the most from the paid showers to refresh out of stress for 15 GBP. Other features include temporary rest pods for relaxing a peaceful sleep.
Heathrow Airport Lounges By Airlines
Below are a further number of Heathrow airport shower facilities and additional amenities to relieve stress during a layover, transit or departure.
- Air Canada Maple Leaf Lounge: For travelers in Economy class, the popular Maple Leaf Lounge boasts 2 different sophisticated centers in the airport. You can wash your jet lag from the private bathroom with shower facilities and enjoy a wonderful complimentary snack with beverages. Located in Terminal 2B inside security, the other 2 locations are near T3 and arrivals. Air Canada travelers need bookings, starting from 375 CAD.
- American Airlines Admiral Club: Crossing the great Atlantic Ocean welcomes you to the capital of the UK. American Airlines’ travelers can rub off the stress of long haul journeys and hit the shower. Indulge your time with snacks and beverages while waiting for your connecting flight or to board.
