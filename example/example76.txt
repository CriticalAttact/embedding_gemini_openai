“I just saw him here like three minutes ago,” Vettori told MMA Junkie. “At the end of the day, when he steps in the cage, we’ll settle it there. I was just pissed because you’re acting tough in the f-cking lobby, and we were supposed to fight in a few hours. You should have just kept your mouth shut and show up in the cage.”
Vettori (14-3-1 MMA, 4-2-1 UFC) and fellow middleweight Roberson (9-2 MMA, 4-2 UFC) were expected to meet at May’s UFC on ESPN+ 29 event in Florida.

“But yeah, then I was about to walk off. Honestly, I was about to walk off, and just right before, I told him, ‘You know you f-cked up? You know you f-cked up? All of this is really f-cked up.’ He was like, ‘Yeah, I know.’ This and that. Then I was about to walk off, and the moment I’m walking off, he looks at me, and he’s like, ‘Oh, but I heard you said that I’m scared to fight you.’ I’m like, ‘Of course I said that, and

What are some unique features of Voyageurs National Park mentioned in the text
------------correct----------------------
't remember a time when we were upset or angry at a motorboat that went by too fast or too close," she said. "I just think we've had a really good experience with them."
Among national parks, Voyageurs is unique because you can't drive through it, said Christina Hausman, executive director of the nonprofit Voyageurs National Park Association.
"You have to get out of your car to experience it," she said. "For me, Voyageurs National Park encapsulates everything that's iconic Minnesotan: the big water, the walleye fishing, the family houseboat trip, the kayak trip, the loons, the wolves."
There are several ways to see the park, including cruising on a houseboat or staying at a lodge on the edge of the park, Hausman said. And if you don't have a boat, don't fret: The park service offers guided boat tours and most area lodges and businesses have water craft available to rent.
"There's really a lot of options to get out on the water," she said. "Don't let that deter you."
The park is celebrating its 40th anniversary this year and is celebrating with a special family program over the summer months, including a ranger-led twilight walk series.
Spencer Smith, of St. Paul, started coming to Voyageurs with his parents when he was a year old. Now the 25-year-old brings his friends to experience what he calls real camping.
"Camping is getting away, getting completely immersed in the wilderness," Smith said. "Because there are no roads, you really get that immersive experience."

What techniques or methods are suggested for handling feelings of hurt in relationships, according to the text

When Forgiveness Doesn't Work

With forgiveness being recommended now even by the medical world, many are looking for specific steps to be used in forgiveness. There are many "techniques" out there and many people have been through all they've read, and faithfully followed through with the suggestions, but still have this burning sting from words that were hurled at them at some time in their life -- or for actions that spoke much louder than words -- and they don't know how to get beyond what "that person did."
Recently I had a family member choose to dump our relationship because I made a one sentence statement in a gentle tone against listening to him rant about another family member. After instantly hanging up on me, he wrote me a note to cancel plans we had to meet on a future date, and then stopped all communication.
I had decided to take a stand against listening to "evil reports" of other family members and that was grounds for termination in his mind. It seems life holds nothing else for him but to repeat the worst of the tv news, weather or family issues. I didn't see that it was a relationship at all if the only function I was to have in his life was to listen to the ranting and reviling.
Then I also heard he'd already begun talking about it to other family members. I certainly wasn't surprised that he did, but I was very surprised that it bothered me. I was actually relieved that I took the stand and said that I didn't want to be in the middle of it. Admittedly I was initially delighted that he would no longer be calling 3-4 times a week for those downgrading conversations. The more I would try to add positive comments to these conversations, while trying to honor his position in the family, the more useless I felt about it all. He seemed to think I was a Pollyanna and it was exhausting to find enough Light to cover the Darkness that he chose to talk about.
So, why would I feel bad about this with so many obvious benefits for me? My wonderful husband is never lacking with resources on Spiritual issues, so he handed me a booklet called, "Rewards of Being Reviled," by Bill Gothard.
The book says that "reviling comes from a heart of scorn and contempt. It is the spewing out of anger and hatred. It is a verbal attack upon another person, given with deep emotional fervor. Its purpose is to vilify, to defame, to bring shame upon, to discredit, and to attribute evil and sinister motives to what that person says and does. It is to engage in ridicule. To ridicule is to cause others to laugh at a person or his ideas. It is to sneer, scoff, and belittle him. Ridicule is an expression of disdain."
It talks about all the ridicule and reviling that David experienced and I have always loved Psalms in times of trouble. His enemies provided opportunity for him to be able to write with deep emotion and insight.
The cool part of the deal is that the books says, "Notwithstanding the serious nature of reviling and the severe consequences for those who engage in it, there are great rewards for those who endure reviling and understand God's purposes for allowing it to occur. Matthew 5:12 tells us to "Rejoice and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven."
It gave a story of a little girl that had been stung a bark scorpion, the most poisonous scorpion found in Arizona, which results in excruciating pain and numbness, then swelling, physical weakness, dizziness, tightening of the throat, and tingling of limbs.
Since this had happened before to the mother, they now had a small device that produced a high-voltage, low-current electrical charge. When electrodes from this unit are placed in the area of the sting or bite, they send a positive electrical charge into the victim's bloodstream. This, in turn, neutralizes the venom, which has a negative charge, and renders it harmless. This leaves only a mild soreness for a short time and a small mark of where the scorpion struck.
Proverbs 18:21 says, "Death and life are in the power of the tongue." Reviling is using the power of the tongue for death, and blessing is using the power of the tongue for life. A curse is like a negative charge, and a blessing is the positive charge that neutralizes the destructive nature of the negative charge.
A verbal blessing is more powerful than a verbal curse because good is more powerful than evil. God is more powerful than Satan, and light is more powerful than darkness.

With forgiveness being recommended now even by the medical world, many are looking for specific steps to be used in forgiveness. There are many "techniques" out there and many people have been through all they've read, and faithfully followed through with the suggestions, but still have this burning sting from words that were hurled at them at some time in their life -- or for actions that spoke much louder than words -- and they don't know how to get beyond what "that person did."

What creative activities have been done to celebrate the snowman theme despite the lack of snow
------------correct----------------------
We are still keeping with our snowman theme for the month of January. The only problem here as been thats its very,very, very cold outside and no snow! That makes it hard for going outside to a build snowman so we decided to build a big one on our stand up freezer.
For the eyes and buttons I used a circle punch. The carrot nose is a funny shaped triangle cut from a piece of orange paper. And the scarf is a 12 x 12 cut into 3 strips of 4 inches thick.
We have also enjoyed snowman suppers made out of pancakes. The eyes and smile are chocolate chips, the buttons are pomegranate seeds, the scarf is a strip of bacon and the "snow" is plain yogurt. The kids really thought these were a fun idea.
In school we have been playing roll a snowman which the kids really love. I got the idea from this and I used this template to cut the pieces out of cardstock. I did just use a single hole punch for the eyes, cut a crocked triangle for the nose, used 3 matching buttons, paper sticks for the arms and I drew the boots. So really I just used the template for the snowman body. heheh
Since we do a lot of cookie sheet activities I decided to make the snowman pieces magnetic so they would stick on the cookie sheet. I love

pite Egypt’s stock market rising 6.7 per cent following the peaceful Morsi triumph, Fitch Ratings notes overall that “recent [SCAF] developments will probably increase the risk of further social unrest and crush any hope of a change in economic policy. But in the extreme, this could lead to a second revolution, and thus a longer period of political uncertainty.”
SCAF and the former regime proxies have long engaged in a battle of hearts and minds to pin the blame of the country’s economic miseries on the revolution and their supporters in order to preserve the old order or some significant semblance of it. This is why the economy is facing an impending crash due precisely to SCAF’s prolonging of the transition in a series of short-sighted exploits that amounted to no more than power grabs. Tourism in decline, for example, was less to do with revolutionaries and Islamists, and much more to do with the state arresting civil society activists and airing xenophobic commercials.
This has raised suspicions that Morsi is being set up to fail and incur nationwide anger for the deteriorating economy. Yet his powers are so shamelessly limited one wonders how SCAF will manage to con the common Egyptian on the street, let alone the Brotherhood’s organisational apparatus that can be deployed fairly effectively to foment popular pressure. Morsi can help to soften any future public backlash by spreading the division of labour and creating the inclusive cabinet he has promised that will appeal to liberals, revolutionaries, Copts and women.
The public is no doubt exhausted with the socio-economic uncertainties, yet the ingredients that keep sparking mass protests are still there. There is a generational war of legitimacy that SCAF may or may not comprehend. Despite their differences, the revolutionaries and the Islamists have reaped more street cred from the 25 January Egyptian revolution than anyone else. Those 18 cataclysmic days have left Egypt with a Whitman’s Sampler of myths, symbols, constructs, martyrs, grievances, and narratives, as well as subsequent key flashpoints (Maspero massacre, Mohamed Mahmoud battle, Cabinet killings, Port Said tragedy and more) that have ever since inspired the growing audience of fearless youth (and much of the public). This has been sustained through social media, satellite TV, and on the streets. All this is challenging the hierarchical and communiqué-announcing archaic generals with their worn out myths of the 1952 ‘revolution’ and the 1973 October war. Whatever mystique the military had is gradually eroded as bodies were crushed under tanks at Maspero and female activists were stomped upon by jackboots.
Moreover, in Egypt’s post-revolutionary and anti-authoritarian climate, raw power can only take you so far. SCAF is not going to be grooming a fourth military dynasty; but the military is not retreating to their barracks in the foreseeable future.
The extended revolution may have to take many a further bloody twist and turn before the military elites eventually come round to seeing that it’s in their (and the country’s) long-term interests for a viable democratic Egypt to materialise with the necessary checks and balances that a healthy state requires to function. For now, the revolutionaries, liberals and even Islamists will need to organise more effectively into a cohesive bloc and exert a concerted effort if they hope to do more than just smell the aroma of a deSCAFinated Egypt.

What network will air the Final Four in 2016 as part of the NCAA Tournament media rights deal
------------correct----------------------
Another over-the-air sports stalwart is going, going, but not quite gone. The 2016 Final Four from Reliant Stadium in Houston will air on TBS as part of the 14-year NCAA Tournament media rights deal between Turner Sports and CBS.
CBS gets the Final Four in 2017, and the companies will continue to alternate Final Four years for the duration of the contract, the companies announced today.
The continued migration toward cable begins next year, when Saturday semifinal games at the 2014 and 2015 NCAA Tournament will air on TBS while the Monday championship game remains on CBS.
In addition, CBS and Turner will split the regional semifinals and finals beginning next year and continuing through 2024. As has been the case since 2011, the first weekend of games will continue to air on CBS, TNT, TBS and truTV.
Network executives David Levy of Turner and Sean McManus of CBS said that under the original rights agreement, Turner had the option to take the entire Final Four in 2014, the first year in which the networks would alternate airing the event.
However, McManus said he and Levy agreed three months ago that having both companies share in Final Four coverage the next two years woul

BEITEN BURKHARDT organised its traditional charity event for children "We are the Cosmos"
Keeping up a longstanding tradition, the international law firm BEITEN BURKHARDT held the "We are the Cosmos" charity event for children from the Kolomna Municipal Social Rehabilitation Centre.
This year we set out with the children on a fascinating two-day journey through the vast expanse of the universe. The first day, the children were visited by employees of the Museum of Cosmonautics, one of the largest academic and historical museums in the world. They told the history of space exploration, from our canine space team, through the first space flight of Yuri Gagarin, and on to life on a space station. The children solved picture-puzzles and crosswords and answered questions. To wrap up the day, each child made his or her own planet, then brought all the small planets together to create their own universe under the slogan: "We are all different, but we are united!"
The second day, the children took part in an art master class called "My Planet" and were introduced to the art of Alexei Leonov, the first Soviet cosmonaut to perform a spacewalk. In addition to his achievements in space, Leonov is also the author of

What an unexpected suprise to be mentioned
on the Selvage blog today!
.....Can you imagine if Chelo from Spain, Jill from New Jersey, and Jodie from Ballarat (Australia) were neighbors? No, I can't either! All together they've made upholstered chairs, window cornices, dresses, and lots more, all with selvages. I guess that's why God spread them out around the world.
What a wonderful selvage neighborhood that would be!!!!

INTERNATIONAL FALLS – Voyageurs National Park has long been a special place for Minnesota boaters, anglers and those who love its big, open waters and wilderness feel without being too far from creature comforts.
For kayakers, Voyageurs offers great paddling, fishing and wildlife viewing. But without a reservation system for the limited campsites, kayakers were at a distinct disadvantage when it came to claiming a spot before they were snatched up.
That's changing, however. This year, Voyageurs is offering a reservation system, reducing visitors' chances of getting stranded without a place to pitch a tent if all campsites are full.
That's good news for kayakers like Linda Pascoe, of Maple Grove, who takes annual trips to Voyageurs with a group from the Twin Cities. Because the campsites are scattered around the lakes, chances are the kayakers aren't going to get the first choice, Pascoe said.
"We're just never going to beat out the motorboat," she said. "Your whole time up there can be trying to figure out where you're staying."
The 218,200-acre Voyageurs National Park is a series of connected lakes and rivers along Minnesota's border with Canada named for the French-Canadian fur transport workers.
Although canoes were the voyageurs' original mode of transportation, the park also appeals to kayakers because of the big lakes with rocky islands that offer protection from the wind, Pascoe said. While she also loves the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, crossing a portage with a kayak and gear is difficult.
"Voyageurs is just a superbly ideal place to go," Pascoe said.
Her group frequently stays at least five days and as long as a week, paddling about 8-12 miles a day. They enjoy the scenery and plentiful wildlife, including deer, beaver, bald eagles and occasionally, an elusive black bear. She's heard but never seen wolves as well.
Unlike the BWCA, motorboats and houseboats are allowed in Voyageurs, along with canoes and kayaks.
Story continues below.
Motorboats don't pose much of a problem for kayaks in Voyageurs, Pascoe said. She said she's more fearful of paddling on Lake Minnetonka.

------------question-----------------------
What concerns do protesters and political scientists like Leon Polyakov express about the proposed Medvedev reforms in Russia
------------correct----------------------
very good with words but not very good about walking the walk and putting these ideas into practice.
The protesters could already read in the Russian press objections to the reforms. Leon Polyakov, a political scientist from the Superior School of Economics, warned that if implemented, the proposed Medvedev reforms could restore Russia to the political system of 1990s associated with instability and economic suffering. Polyakov reminded his readers that during the not so gay 1990s, parties were used as a cloak for businesses and money laundering and they proliferated by the hundreds.
The opposition is also worried that it is one thing to liberalize the requirements, it is another thing to decide that the requirements have been met. If Putin's henchmen decide to invalidate a candidate, they can simply challenge some of the signatures on nominating petitions and disqualify it.
A final suspicion is that Russia may be heading for the 1990s but it should be recalled that Russia was hardly democratic during Boris Yeltsin's presidency after he had won his confrontation with Parliament in 1993. It actually may make sense to allow the opposition to capture parliament, as under the Yeltsin Constitution the President is all powerful. This way the opposition in parliament can be blamed for things. One of the problems of the current system is that since Putin and company hold all the levers of power, there is nobody else to blame when things go wrong.

------------question-----------------------
What challenges does Morsi face in addressing the deteriorating economy amid SCAF's influence in Egypt
------------correct----------------------
pite Egypt’s stock market rising 6.7 per cent following the peaceful Morsi triumph, Fitch Ratings notes overall that “recent [SCAF] developments will probably increase the risk of further social unrest and crush any hope of a change in economic policy. But in the extreme, this could lead to a second revolution, and thus a longer period of political uncertainty.”
SCAF and the former regime proxies have long engaged in a battle of hearts and minds to pin the blame of the country’s economic miseries on the revolution and their supporters in order to preserve the old order or some significant semblance of it. This is why the economy is facing an impending crash due precisely to SCAF’s prolonging of the transition in a series of short-sighted exploits that amounted to no more than power grabs. Tourism in decline, for example, was less to do with revolutionaries and Islamists, and much more to do with the state arresting civil society activists and airing xenophobic commercials.
This has raised suspicions that Morsi is being set up to fail and incur nationwide anger for the deteriorating economy. Yet his powers are so shamelessly limited one wonders how SCAF will manage to con the common Egyptian on the street, let alone the Brotherhood’s organisational apparatus that can be deployed fairly effectively to foment popular pressure. Morsi can help to soften any future public backlash by spreading the division of labour and creating the inclusive cabinet he has promised that will appeal to liberals, revolutionaries, Copts and women.
The public is no doubt exhausted with the socio-economic uncertainties, yet the ingredients that keep sparking mass protests are still there. There is a generational war of legitimacy that SCAF may or may not comprehend. Despite their differences, the revolutionaries and the Islamists have reaped more street cred from the 25 January Egyptian revolution than anyone else. Those 18 cataclysmic days have left Egypt with a Whitman’s Sampler of myths, symbols, constructs, martyrs, grievances, and narratives, as well as subsequent key flashpoints (Maspero massacre, Mohamed Mahmoud battle, Cabinet killings, Port Said tragedy and more) that have ever since inspired the growing audience of fearless youth (and much of the public). This has been sustained through social media, satellite TV, and on the streets. All this is challenging the hierarchical and communiqué-announcing archaic generals with their worn out myths of the 1952 ‘revolution’ and the 1973 October war. Whatever mystique the military had is gradually eroded as bodies were crushed under tanks at Maspero and female activists were stomped upon by jackboots.
Moreover, in Egypt’s post-revolutionary and anti-authoritarian climate, raw power can only take you so far. SCAF is not going to be grooming a fourth military dynasty; but the military is not retreating to their barracks in the foreseeable future.
The extended revolution may have to take many a further bloody twist and turn before the military elites eventually come round to seeing that it’s in their (and the country’s) long-term interests for a viable democratic Egypt to materialise with the necessary checks and balances that a healthy state requires to function. For now, the revolutionaries, liberals and even Islamists will need to organise more effectively into a cohesive bloc and exert a concerted effort if they hope to do more than just smell the aroma of a deSCAFinated Egypt.

------------question-----------------------
What challenges does the new president Morsi face regarding military control and the economy in Egypt
------------correct----------------------
Subtlety is not a strong feature of the Egyptian landscape, whether you look at its overt religious piety, emphasis on a person’s title, the fragrance generously sprayed that heralds a person’s arrival from 15 metres away, the imposing pyramids, or Judge Farouk Sultan’s protracted defence of the ‘divinely-sanctioned’ electoral commission before he could get around to just announcing the presidential winner. Yet the least subtle of any Egyptian agency has to be the league of ‘extraordinary’ gentlemen – the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF). In seizing all branches of government, ripping up the constitution and pre-emptively defanging the Morsi presidency, SCAF have not only sought to turn the self-styled ‘Revolution 2.0’ into a ‘Dictatorship 2.0’, but have done so with a degree of recklessness, desperation and lack of imagination that leaves their hand even more exposed than before.
Decoding the socio-political hieroglyphics reads like this: New politics (revolutionaries and liberals) reluctantly united with religious politics (Muslim Brotherhood) to fight the union between old politics (Felul, former regime remnants led by Ahmed Shafik) and military politics (SCAF). Old politics (and the revival of corrupt patronage networks) has been dealt a death-blow. Now a considerable number of revolutionaries find themselves stuck in a marriage of convenience with the Muslim Brotherhood to take on the military council and their supplementary constitutional declaration, the timing of the next parliamentary elections in particular and a painfully-slow transition in general.
The Muslim Brotherhood’s electoral strength should not be overstated. Last month’s presidential elections illustrated that given the choice between a secularist candidate like Hamdeen Sabahi’s and felul/Islamists, Cairenes and, particularly, Alexandrians, will go overwhelmingly for the former. The Brotherhood cannot afford to alienate urban centres as it comes to the realisation that progressive politics has the upper hand in Egypt’s largest cities.
Say that a deal was struck between SCAF and the Brotherhood, history has shown time and again that it never lasts, often at the expense of Egypt’s welfare. This also explains why revolutionaries and liberals who boycotted the run-off elections seek to capitalise on an inevitable SCAF-Brotherhood clash and to nurture a third political-civil current.
Whatever one makes of the Morsi victory, the new president has inherited a martial reality that will compel him to deal with the military’s brazen consolidation of power over the security apparatus, civilian administration, and 18 of Egypt’s 27 governorates that are currently headed by retired generals. Not to mention the SCAF loyalists recruited to or retained in key ministries and industries. He will have to deal with this while seeking to revive a brutalised economy – addressing 12.4 per cent unemployment (youth unemployment: 25 per cent), 40 per cent under the poverty line; reforming the dysfunctional education system, labour laws, public finance, attracting investors again and reversing the frighteningly high crime wave – while not trespassing onto the military’s off-bound economic empire, which reportedly encompasses up to 40 per cent of the country’s economy. The structural tensions that ignited the 2011 Egyptian revolution are still present. For example, labour strikes have been ongoing and continue to hit at the nerve centre of SCAF’s economic enterprises.

What is the author's stance on President Trump's description of the coronavirus as related to Communist China
------------correct----------------------
to mention such things?
Timmy is nothing but a stooge in every way imaginable. Personally I am very much in favor of President Trump calling things exactly what they are. I don’t see any reason to ‘sugar-coat’ the obvious. The world needs to know that Communist China did everything possible to keep anyone from finding out about or learning of this virus that began in Wuhan. Because they delayed, many lives have been needlessly lost. Communist China should have much to answer for when this is over. Calling this the Chinese virus or ‘ChiCom’ virus or anything else that ties it to the Chinese doesn’t bother me in the least. President Trump is simply calling a spade, a spade
Bootlickers like ‘Little Timmy,’ who have a rather long history of siding with repressive governments wherever they are, have got virtually no business criticizing this president over anything, least of all when it comes to the terms used by the president when discussing the ongoing coronavirus that, whether or not Timmy wants to admit it, has its origin in Communist China. And before he chooses to criticize President Trump, or anyone else, for using inflammatory language perhaps he should first look a little closer to home at those who have spent the majority of the last three years directing nothing but inflammatory language at this president.
Kaine is the perfect example of those on the left continue to hurl all manner of accusations about how President Trump did not respond appropriately or timely and yet they are never able to cite exactly what his specific ‘missteps,’ might have been. What I see coming from the president is his handling the crisis far better than any other leader, while all I see coming from the Democrats is the same old, tired ‘Orange Man Bad’ routine. And it continues to disgust me that they seek political opportunity instead of uniting behind the President. And I’m also getting tired of these claims of racism when we all know where it was that this virus originated, in Communist China!
And it tells us all we need to know about the Democrats that they are now, nearly en masse, out in force determined, or so it would seem, in their effort to protect the regime in Communist China against what we all know is fact. The very same regime responsible for unleashing what has become this massive pandemic affecting, with few exceptions, the entire world and all courtesy of its carelessness, its dishonesty, and what was a near complete suppression of all information regarding just how truly dangerous this ‘coronavirus’ was and remains. That Democrats can find it within themselves to defend such behavior should cause even their supporters to pause.
This is the very same Communist China that harvests organs from political prisoners and that continues to steal from us our intellectual property, including secrets from both our military and private businesses. The same Communist China that keeps its people living in fear. And yet, it’s Democrats, like Kaine, who continue to worry more about offending Communist China than forcing the regime admit responsibility for being behind what has led to this global ‘pandemic.’ I find it nothing short of unbelievable that there are people who continue to vote for them. Democrats continue to make clear what’s in America’s best interest does not concern them.
Kaine is nothing more than a disloyal American which, for a Democrat, is standard operating practice. To chastise the president for daring to criticize Communist China, a country which clearly steals our technology and our secrets and IS the country which lied over and over while this virus grew, really is beyond the pale. Kaine is a waste of skin and needs to stop bashing the president, who is doing a fantastic job, far better than would Timmy’s former running-mate, Hitlery, been able to do. He has gotten rid of all manner of red tape, to help the American people get the medicines they need. What has Kaine, or ANY Democrat, done thus far except to criticize? NOTHING!

nearly elastic region.
It is most common for analysts in solid mechanics to use linear material models, due to ease of computation. However, real materials often exhibit non-linear behavior. As new materials are used and old ones are pushed to their limits, non-linear material models are becoming more common.
These are basic models that describe how a solid responds to an applied stress:
Elasticity - When an applied stress is removed, the material returns to its undeformed state. Linearly elastic materials, those that deform proportionally to the applied load, can be described by the linear elasticity equations such as Hooke's law.
Viscoelasticity - These are materials that behave elastically, but also have damping: when the stress is applied and removed, work has to be done against the damping effects and is converted in heat within the material resulting in a hysteresis loop in the stress-strain curve. This implies that the material response has time-dependence.
Plasticity - Materials that behave elastically generally do so when the applied stress is less than a yield value. When the stress is greater than the yield stress, the material behaves plastically and does not return to its previous state. That is, deformation that occurs after yield is permanent.
Viscoplasticity - Combines theories of viscoelasticity and plasticity and applies to materials like gels and mud.
Thermoelasticity - There is coupling of mechanical with thermal responses. In general, thermoelasticity is concerned with elastic solids under conditions that are neither isothermal nor adiabatic. The simplest theory involves the Fourier's law of heat conduction, as opposed to advanced theories with physically more realistic models.
1873: Carlo Alberto Castigliano presented his dissertation "Intorno ai sistemi elastici", which contains his theorem for computing displacement as partial derivative of the strain energy. This theorem includes the method of least work as a special case
1874: Otto Mohr formalized the idea of a statically indeterminate structure.
1936: Hardy Cross' publication of the moment distribution method, an important innovation in the design of continuous frames.
1941: Alexander Hrennikoff solved the discretization of plane elasticity problems using a lattice framework
1942: R. Courant divided a domain into finite subregions
1956: J. Turner, R. W. Clough, H. C. Martin, and L. J. Topp's paper on the "Stiffness and Deflection of Complex Structures" introduces the name "finite-element method" and is widely recognized as the first comprehensive treatment of the method as it is known today

BEITEN BURKHARDT organised its traditional charity event for children "We are the Cosmos"
Keeping up a longstanding tradition, the international law firm BEITEN BURKHARDT held the "We are the Cosmos" charity event for children from the Kolomna Municipal Social Rehabilitation Centre.
This year we set out with the children on a fascinating two-day journey through the vast expanse of the universe. The first day, the children were visited by employees of the Museum of Cosmonautics, one of the largest academic and historical museums in the world. They told the history of space exploration, from our canine space team, through the first space flight of Yuri Gagarin, and on to life on a space station. The children solved picture-puzzles and crosswords and answered questions. To wrap up the day, each child made his or her own planet, then brought all the small planets together to create their own universe under the slogan: "We are all different, but we are united!"
The second day, the children took part in an art master class called "My Planet" and were introduced to the art of Alexei Leonov, the first Soviet cosmonaut to perform a spacewalk. In addition to his achievements in space, Leonov is also the author of

What are the rules for playing the game Roll a Snowman
------------correct----------------------
using magnetic photo paper. I simply cut little squares and place them onto whatever I want to stick onto the cookie sheet. For the black eyes I put the paper right on the photo sheets and then used the hole punch. But all the other pieces just got 1-2 little squares of magnetic paper.
To play Roll a snowman we put all the pieces onto the cookie sheet. In order to start your snowman you need to roll a 1. After you roll the one you continue to roll the dice and add the pieces until you have completed your snowman. If you wanted to it to take longer you can change the rules so you only can put on 1 arm, boot or button at a time.
Another fun activity the kids did was paint these wooden snowmen. I think I purchased them a few years ago on clearance but its only been this year that they are "into" painting so I got them out and let them paint away.
I love the thinking that two brushes will make it go faster.
When they were finished painting I glued on the eyes for them.
Lady J did all the white herself but I helped only a little bit with the red and orange.
Eben's job was to do it all by himself. He did a great job not mixing up the colors to much.
Now we have 2 more snowman to add to to our snowman decor

't remember a time when we were upset or angry at a motorboat that went by too fast or too close," she said. "I just think we've had a really good experience with them."
Among national parks, Voyageurs is unique because you can't drive through it, said Christina Hausman, executive director of the nonprofit Voyageurs National Park Association.
"You have to get out of your car to experience it," she said. "For me, Voyageurs National Park encapsulates everything that's iconic Minnesotan: the big water, the walleye fishing, the family houseboat trip, the kayak trip, the loons, the wolves."
There are several ways to see the park, including cruising on a houseboat or staying at a lodge on the edge of the park, Hausman said. And if you don't have a boat, don't fret: The park service offers guided boat tours and most area lodges and businesses have water craft available to rent.
"There's really a lot of options to get out on the water," she said. "Don't let that deter you."
The park is celebrating its 40th anniversary this year and is celebrating with a special family program over the summer months, including a ranger-led twilight walk series.
Spencer Smith, of St. Paul, started coming to Voyageurs with his parents when he was a year old. Now the 25-year-old brings his friends to experience what he calls real camping.
"Camping is getting away, getting completely immersed in the wilderness," Smith said. "Because there are no roads, you really get that immersive experience."

What steps did the author take to find freedom from the emotional pain caused by the reviler and embrace a deeper relationship with the Lord
------------correct----------------------
on. The incident hurt and shocked her and weeks later she was still emotionally involved in the incident while continuing to rehearse the reviler's words in her mind and feeling the pain each time she did.
She had forgiven this leader, but her emotions were rooted deeper than her words and her forgiveness was hollow and insincere. As time passed, her wound only became more infected. Her forgiveness was a surface response that she knew was Biblical and right, but it did not reach the venom that was surging through her emotional veins. The venom of reviling is long-lasting.
One day she heard a message on the power of verbal blessings and why it is essential for us to bless those who curse us. She understood this concept, and that night she could not fall asleep until she verbally blessed the leader who had reviled her.
Since then, she has continued to have freedom in her spirit from the hurts of this past event. She also has a deeper walk with the Lord as a result of this experience.
How do we do this?
Scripture provides words that can be used: Numbers 6:24-26: "The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: The Lord make His face to shine up on thee, and be gracious unto thee: The Lord lift up His countenance upon thee, and give thee peace."
When we ask God to bring His benefits to the lives of revilers, we are blessing them. I have often looked back at some of the genetic options of my family tree and can easily say, "There but for the grace of God, go I." It certainly makes it easier to have mercy and grace on others who have not chosen to walk out of circumstances and generational curses.
My prayer for blessings my enemies is that those blessings will overcome the darkness of the curses that have caused them to be so angry. If you will look back on the situation you struggle with, you will find ways that God blessed you because of it.
Let me give you a personal example that Bill Gothard shared in his booklet mentioned above. He writes, "When attendance at the Basic Youth Conflicts Seminar first began to multiply, it was something of a phenomenon and was certainly a surprise to me. I could not explain it and was therefore hesitant to talk about it to reporters. They assumed that this constituted secrecy, and two Christian magazines published articles of a defamatory nature.
" I called the writer of the first article and tried to explain what I thought he had misunderstood. He reacted, and matters became worse. When the second article was published, God prompted me to have a different response. I called the writer. When he learned that I was on the phone, he cautiously answered. I then said, 'I have called to tell you how God has used your articles to benefit my life and ministry." He was totally surprised and said, 'Oh?' I continued and explained that God had used his article to do a work in my life, and in the ministry in three very positive ways.
" First, I was forced to reexamine what I was teaching and how people perceived what I was saying. Second, it unified the people who had been to the seminar and knew that the article reflected a misunderstanding of what was being taught. Third, as a result of this reviling, people had sent in thousands of dollars to encourage me and to support the seminar ministry.
" I'm sure the writer was not expecting this response. He became warm and friendly, and thanked me for my call. God has blessed both of our ministries since that day .... and today I consider him a friend."
My prayer is that this will allow you to give some thought to another approach to your memories and wounds. Ask God to first show you good that has come from it. Ask him to let you see how He has used it for good in your life as Romans 8 promises. Then, take the above suggestion from Scripture and choose to bless the person every time the memory returns.

Kefallinia is a minor airfield located south of Corfu. Coordination between Athens, Andravida and Kefallinia is unpredictable.
Expect initial descent clearance from Athens Control with late handover to Andravida approach. Late changes of STAR clearance can be expected, with the most commonly used arrival procedures via AKETO. Typical clearance would be ASTUS 1G/1P. Onward clearance from Andravida is required before proceeding beyond AKETO. Expect late handover when approaching AKETO, which frequently involves last minute holding instructions, even during periods of light traffic density and good weather.

What is the reason Japanese authorities plan to summon Apple officials this week
------------correct----------------------
Japanese authorities plan to summon Apple officials this week over complaints that its iTunes online store has billed customers for downloads they never made, officials said Monday.
In at least 95 cases in Japan involving five major credit card companies, iTunes customers said they had sometimes been charged thousands of dollars, they said.
"We have seen such cases increasing, notably since autumn last year," said an official with Japan's Consumer Affairs Agency.
"The damage in those cases seems to range from a few hundred yen to several hundred thousand yen (from several dollars to several thousand dollars)."

What does Vettori believe about his upcoming fight and how does he intend to manage his emotions
------------correct----------------------
I really believe that. I think you were a broken man yesterday. You’re a broken man today,’ and that’s what I told him. Then he put his chest out and he tried to square off with me. That’s why I freaked out.”
Vettori tried to find anyone willing to fight him in Florida but ultimately had to settle for a rebooking at Saturday’s UFC on ESPN 10, which takes place at UFC Apex and airs live on ESPN and streams on ESPN+.
There’s no question it’s a grudge match, but Vettori said he understands the importance of keeping his emotions in check.
“I just kind of like flipped off on him when he tried to square off on me,” Vettori said. “At the end of the day, now I’m going to go out, beat him up as brutally as I can, and that’s it.
“You’ll see a lot of action, but I’m not stupid. Any high-level fighter, they know you can’t let anger get to your head. I’m not stupid. I’m not a stupid fighter. At the end of the day, you have to think, the worst thing you can do to him is to beat him and walk away with a dominant, super beautiful-fashioned win. That’s it. That’s what I’m going to do.”
Oddsmakers have Vettori installed as a sizable favorite in the contest, currently sitting at around a -230, suggesting a 70 percent probability of winning. That sounds about right to “The Italian Dream,” who believes he’s going to send a message in this grudge match.
“It is a little bit personal,” Vettori said. “It is personal. It’s just that now, the only thing that I want is for him to step into the cage, and I’ll be happy like this. But it is personal because he messed with my own life. He messed with my coaches’ life. He messed with the whole team.
“It was unprofessional and a bunch of things. But I think he’s a solid fighter – just not on my level. When the level of competition went up for him, he wasn’t able to match the level. That’s what happened. He’s jut not on my level.”

Subtlety is not a strong feature of the Egyptian landscape, whether you look at its overt religious piety, emphasis on a person’s title, the fragrance generously sprayed that heralds a person’s arrival from 15 metres away, the imposing pyramids, or Judge Farouk Sultan’s protracted defence of the ‘divinely-sanctioned’ electoral commission before he could get around to just announcing the presidential winner. Yet the least subtle of any Egyptian agency has to be the league of ‘extraordinary’ gentlemen – the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF). In seizing all branches of government, ripping up the constitution and pre-emptively defanging the Morsi presidency, SCAF have not only sought to turn the self-styled ‘Revolution 2.0’ into a ‘Dictatorship 2.0’, but have done so with a degree of recklessness, desperation and lack of imagination that leaves their hand even more exposed than before.
Decoding the socio-political hieroglyphics reads like this: New politics (revolutionaries and liberals) reluctantly united with religious politics (Muslim Brotherhood) to fight the union between old politics (Felul, former regime remnants led by Ahmed Shafik) and military politics (SCAF). Old politics (and the revival of corrupt patronage networks) has been dealt a death-blow. Now a considerable number of revolutionaries find themselves stuck in a marriage of convenience with the Muslim Brotherhood to take on the military council and their supplementary constitutional declaration, the timing of the next parliamentary elections in particular and a painfully-slow transition in general.
The Muslim Brotherhood’s electoral strength should not be overstated. Last month’s presidential elections illustrated that given the choice between a secularist candidate like Hamdeen Sabahi’s and felul/Islamists, Cairenes and, particularly, Alexandrians, will go overwhelmingly for the former. The Brotherhood cannot afford to alienate urban centres as it comes to the realisation that progressive politics has the upper hand in Egypt’s largest cities.
Say that a deal was struck between SCAF and the Brotherhood, history has shown time and again that it never lasts, often at the expense of Egypt’s welfare. This also explains why revolutionaries and liberals who boycotted the run-off elections seek to capitalise on an inevitable SCAF-Brotherhood clash and to nurture a third political-civil current.
Whatever one makes of the Morsi victory, the new president has inherited a martial reality that will compel him to deal with the military’s brazen consolidation of power over the security apparatus, civilian administration, and 18 of Egypt’s 27 governorates that are currently headed by retired generals. Not to mention the SCAF loyalists recruited to or retained in key ministries and industries. He will have to deal with this while seeking to revive a brutalised economy – addressing 12.4 per cent unemployment (youth unemployment: 25 per cent), 40 per cent under the poverty line; reforming the dysfunctional education system, labour laws, public finance, attracting investors again and reversing the frighteningly high crime wave – while not trespassing onto the military’s off-bound economic empire, which reportedly encompasses up to 40 per cent of the country’s economy. The structural tensions that ignited the 2011 Egyptian revolution are still present. For example, labour strikes have been ongoing and continue to hit at the nerve centre of SCAF’s economic enterprises.

using magnetic photo paper. I simply cut little squares and place them onto whatever I want to stick onto the cookie sheet. For the black eyes I put the paper right on the photo sheets and then used the hole punch. But all the other pieces just got 1-2 little squares of magnetic paper.
To play Roll a snowman we put all the pieces onto the cookie sheet. In order to start your snowman you need to roll a 1. After you roll the one you continue to roll the dice and add the pieces until you have completed your snowman. If you wanted to it to take longer you can change the rules so you only can put on 1 arm, boot or button at a time.
Another fun activity the kids did was paint these wooden snowmen. I think I purchased them a few years ago on clearance but its only been this year that they are "into" painting so I got them out and let them paint away.
I love the thinking that two brushes will make it go faster.
When they were finished painting I glued on the eyes for them.
Lady J did all the white herself but I helped only a little bit with the red and orange.
Eben's job was to do it all by himself. He did a great job not mixing up the colors to much.
Now we have 2 more snowman to add to to our snowman decor

Another over-the-air sports stalwart is going, going, but not quite gone. The 2016 Final Four from Reliant Stadium in Houston will air on TBS as part of the 14-year NCAA Tournament media rights deal between Turner Sports and CBS.
CBS gets the Final Four in 2017, and the companies will continue to alternate Final Four years for the duration of the contract, the companies announced today.
The continued migration toward cable begins next year, when Saturday semifinal games at the 2014 and 2015 NCAA Tournament will air on TBS while the Monday championship game remains on CBS.
In addition, CBS and Turner will split the regional semifinals and finals beginning next year and continuing through 2024. As has been the case since 2011, the first weekend of games will continue to air on CBS, TNT, TBS and truTV.
Network executives David Levy of Turner and Sean McManus of CBS said that under the original rights agreement, Turner had the option to take the entire Final Four in 2014, the first year in which the networks would alternate airing the event.
However, McManus said he and Levy agreed three months ago that having both companies share in Final Four coverage the next two years woul

What items have Chelo, Jill, and Jodie made using selvages
------------correct----------------------
that have been named in the Quilt Sampler Featured Shop Lists-
What an unexpected suprise to be mentioned
on the Selvage blog today!
.....Can you imagine if Chelo from Spain, Jill from New Jersey, and Jodie from Ballarat (Australia) were neighbors? No, I can't either! All together they've made upholstered chairs, window cornices, dresses, and lots more, all with selvages. I guess that's why God spread them out around the world.
What a wonderful selvage neighborhood that would be!!!!

What factors contributed to the increasing dissatisfaction of the Sioux and their deterioration of relations with white settlers
------------correct----------------------
.
Each year the Sioux became more dissatisfied and warlike. Many treaties were made with them by commissioners sent out by the United States government, but they were made only to be broken, both the government and the Indians: being equally faithless. Due to the loss of their buffalo herds, the Indians were starving. They blamed the white settlers: for their troubles, and as these troubles increased so did their hatred of the white race, though in earlier days the Sioux were friendly to white men.
By terms of a treaty signed in 1868 the Black Hills had been ceded to the Sioux Indians. After gold was discovered in the Hills in 1874 no further efforts were made to keep the white men out of the Hills. The Indians had broken their part of the treaty, and the government knew that the mines would never be worked by the Indians, so the entire agreement was set aside. (The Sioux are still trying to collect large sums of money in payment of their claims to the Black Hills.

to mention such things?
Timmy is nothing but a stooge in every way imaginable. Personally I am very much in favor of President Trump calling things exactly what they are. I don’t see any reason to ‘sugar-coat’ the obvious. The world needs to know that Communist China did everything possible to keep anyone from finding out about or learning of this virus that began in Wuhan. Because they delayed, many lives have been needlessly lost. Communist China should have much to answer for when this is over. Calling this the Chinese virus or ‘ChiCom’ virus or anything else that ties it to the Chinese doesn’t bother me in the least. President Trump is simply calling a spade, a spade
Bootlickers like ‘Little Timmy,’ who have a rather long history of siding with repressive governments wherever they are, have got virtually no business criticizing this president over anything, least of all when it comes to the terms used by the president when discussing the ongoing coronavirus that, whether or not Timmy wants to admit it, has its origin in Communist China. And before he chooses to criticize President Trump, or anyone else, for using inflammatory language perhaps he should first look a little closer to home at those who have spent the majority of the last three years directing nothing but inflammatory language at this president.
Kaine is the perfect example of those on the left continue to hurl all manner of accusations about how President Trump did not respond appropriately or timely and yet they are never able to cite exactly what his specific ‘missteps,’ might have been. What I see coming from the president is his handling the crisis far better than any other leader, while all I see coming from the Democrats is the same old, tired ‘Orange Man Bad’ routine. And it continues to disgust me that they seek political opportunity instead of uniting behind the President. And I’m also getting tired of these claims of racism when we all know where it was that this virus originated, in Communist China!
And it tells us all we need to know about the Democrats that they are now, nearly en masse, out in force determined, or so it would seem, in their effort to protect the regime in Communist China against what we all know is fact. The very same regime responsible for unleashing what has become this massive pandemic affecting, with few exceptions, the entire world and all courtesy of its carelessness, its dishonesty, and what was a near complete suppression of all information regarding just how truly dangerous this ‘coronavirus’ was and remains. That Democrats can find it within themselves to defend such behavior should cause even their supporters to pause.
This is the very same Communist China that harvests organs from political prisoners and that continues to steal from us our intellectual property, including secrets from both our military and private businesses. The same Communist China that keeps its people living in fear. And yet, it’s Democrats, like Kaine, who continue to worry more about offending Communist China than forcing the regime admit responsibility for being behind what has led to this global ‘pandemic.’ I find it nothing short of unbelievable that there are people who continue to vote for them. Democrats continue to make clear what’s in America’s best interest does not concern them.
Kaine is nothing more than a disloyal American which, for a Democrat, is standard operating practice. To chastise the president for daring to criticize Communist China, a country which clearly steals our technology and our secrets and IS the country which lied over and over while this virus grew, really is beyond the pale. Kaine is a waste of skin and needs to stop bashing the president, who is doing a fantastic job, far better than would Timmy’s former running-mate, Hitlery, been able to do. He has gotten rid of all manner of red tape, to help the American people get the medicines they need. What has Kaine, or ANY Democrat, done thus far except to criticize? NOTHING!

I really believe that. I think you were a broken man yesterday. You’re a broken man today,’ and that’s what I told him. Then he put his chest out and he tried to square off with me. That’s why I freaked out.”
Vettori tried to find anyone willing to fight him in Florida but ultimately had to settle for a rebooking at Saturday’s UFC on ESPN 10, which takes place at UFC Apex and airs live on ESPN and streams on ESPN+.
There’s no question it’s a grudge match, but Vettori said he understands the importance of keeping his emotions in check.
“I just kind of like flipped off on him when he tried to square off on me,” Vettori said. “At the end of the day, now I’m going to go out, beat him up as brutally as I can, and that’s it.
“You’ll see a lot of action, but I’m not stupid. Any high-level fighter, they know you can’t let anger get to your head. I’m not stupid. I’m not a stupid fighter. At the end of the day, you have to think, the worst thing you can do to him is to beat him and walk away with a dominant, super beautiful-fashioned win. That’s it. That’s what I’m going to do.”
Oddsmakers have Vettori installed as a sizable favorite in the contest, currently sitting at around a -230, suggesting a 70 percent probability of winning. That sounds about right to “The Italian Dream,” who believes he’s going to send a message in this grudge match.
“It is a little bit personal,” Vettori said. “It is personal. It’s just that now, the only thing that I want is for him to step into the cage, and I’ll be happy like this. But it is personal because he messed with my own life. He messed with my coaches’ life. He messed with the whole team.
“It was unprofessional and a bunch of things. But I think he’s a solid fighter – just not on my level. When the level of competition went up for him, he wasn’t able to match the level. That’s what happened. He’s jut not on my level.”

What inspired the author to start saving the selvage when quilting
------------correct----------------------
Adventures of a Novelty Fabric and Selvage Obsessed Quilter
Glad you stopped by!
I am a busy wife and the mom of 19 year old twins, a boy and a girl who are Sophomores at Syracuse University.
I have been quilting since the spring of 2008. I love novelty fabrics, colorful and unique.
Selvage quilting is addictive! Who knew the "junk" we cut off and threw out would be what I now save! I started a new tradition when I travel--visiting quilt stores! I particularly enjoy going to stores

------------question-----------------------
What altitude should inbound flights cross at AKETO, and what should flight crews do if the crossing altitude is not specified
------------correct----------------------
clearance,Andravida may be implicitly expecting inbound flights to cross AKETO at 8000ft altitude. Flights not able to meet the restriction can expect to be directed hold at AKETO. If a crossing altitude at AKETO has not been specified, it is strongly recommended that flight crews request clarification from Athens and reconfirm with Andravida on handover. Note the middle airspace danger area to the south west of KFN VOR.
Steep glidepath of 3.4 degrees.
RUNWAY AND AIRPORT FACILITIES
For landing on Rwy 32 the last 1500 ft of runway slopes rapidly down to the coast, only becoming visible during the latter part of the landing run.
Expect turbulence on final approach to rwy 14/32 when easterly winds prevail from 050 degrees to 130 degrees at 15 KT or more.
Birds in vicinity of airport.

What types of cattle were primarily ranches in northwest Nebraska during the period prior to 1880
------------correct----------------------
Enter a grandparent's name to get started.
Cattle ranches were the first settlements made in northwest Nebraska. The surplus stock from these ranches was bought by the United States government at good prices, so the business was a profitable one for a few years. To the west of Brown county several large outfits were found very early, previous to 1880: Boiling Springs ranch owned by Carpenter and Morehead; the JP ranch on the Niobrara about twelve miles below Boiling Springs; the Newman ranch twenty-one miles west of Boiling Springs; and the Hunter ranch about due south of where Gordon is now located. The herds owned by these outfits were driven into this country from Texas over the old “Chisholm Trail”. They were the Texas longhorns, a breed no longer seen in this state.
These ranchers were in continual warfare with the Indians and many lonely graves are found in the hills along the Niobrara river where rest the remains of cowboys who were shot and scalped by Sioux

Enter a grandparent's name to get started.
Cattle ranches were the first settlements made in northwest Nebraska. The surplus stock from these ranches was bought by the United States government at good prices, so the business was a profitable one for a few years. To the west of Brown county several large outfits were found very early, previous to 1880: Boiling Springs ranch owned by Carpenter and Morehead; the JP ranch on the Niobrara about twelve miles below Boiling Springs; the Newman ranch twenty-one miles west of Boiling Springs; and the Hunter ranch about due south of where Gordon is now located. The herds owned by these outfits were driven into this country from Texas over the old “Chisholm Trail”. They were the Texas longhorns, a breed no longer seen in this state.
These ranchers were in continual warfare with the Indians and many lonely graves are found in the hills along the Niobrara river where rest the remains of cowboys who were shot and scalped by Sioux

When Forgiveness Doesn't Work

With forgiveness being recommended now even by the medical world, many are looking for specific steps to be used in forgiveness. There are many "techniques" out there and many people have been through all they've read, and faithfully followed through with the suggestions, but still have this burning sting from words that were hurled at them at some time in their life -- or for actions that spoke much louder than words -- and they don't know how to get beyond what "that person did."
Recently I had a family member choose to dump our relationship because I made a one sentence statement in a gentle tone against listening to him rant about another family member. After instantly hanging up on me, he wrote me a note to cancel plans we had to meet on a future date, and then stopped all communication.
I had decided to take a stand against listening to "evil reports" of other family members and that was grounds for termination in his mind. It seems life holds nothing else for him but to repeat the worst of the tv news, weather or family issues. I didn't see that it was a relationship at all if the only function I was to have in his life was to listen to the ranting and reviling.
Then I also heard he'd already begun talking about it to other family members. I certainly wasn't surprised that he did, but I was very surprised that it bothered me. I was actually relieved that I took the stand and said that I didn't want to be in the middle of it. Admittedly I was initially delighted that he would no longer be calling 3-4 times a week for those downgrading conversations. The more I would try to add positive comments to these conversations, while trying to honor his position in the family, the more useless I felt about it all. He seemed to think I was a Pollyanna and it was exhausting to find enough Light to cover the Darkness that he chose to talk about.
So, why would I feel bad about this with so many obvious benefits for me? My wonderful husband is never lacking with resources on Spiritual issues, so he handed me a booklet called, "Rewards of Being Reviled," by Bill Gothard.
The book says that "reviling comes from a heart of scorn and contempt. It is the spewing out of anger and hatred. It is a verbal attack upon another person, given with deep emotional fervor. Its purpose is to vilify, to defame, to bring shame upon, to discredit, and to attribute evil and sinister motives to what that person says and does. It is to engage in ridicule. To ridicule is to cause others to laugh at a person or his ideas. It is to sneer, scoff, and belittle him. Ridicule is an expression of disdain."
It talks about all the ridicule and reviling that David experienced and I have always loved Psalms in times of trouble. His enemies provided opportunity for him to be able to write with deep emotion and insight.
The cool part of the deal is that the books says, "Notwithstanding the serious nature of reviling and the severe consequences for those who engage in it, there are great rewards for those who endure reviling and understand God's purposes for allowing it to occur. Matthew 5:12 tells us to "Rejoice and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven."
It gave a story of a little girl that had been stung a bark scorpion, the most poisonous scorpion found in Arizona, which results in excruciating pain and numbness, then swelling, physical weakness, dizziness, tightening of the throat, and tingling of limbs.
Since this had happened before to the mother, they now had a small device that produced a high-voltage, low-current electrical charge. When electrodes from this unit are placed in the area of the sting or bite, they send a positive electrical charge into the victim's bloodstream. This, in turn, neutralizes the venom, which has a negative charge, and renders it harmless. This leaves only a mild soreness for a short time and a small mark of where the scorpion struck.
Proverbs 18:21 says, "Death and life are in the power of the tongue." Reviling is using the power of the tongue for death, and blessing is using the power of the tongue for life. A curse is like a negative charge, and a blessing is the positive charge that neutralizes the destructive nature of the negative charge.
A verbal blessing is more powerful than a verbal curse because good is more powerful than evil. God is more powerful than Satan, and light is more powerful than darkness.
On a mission trip, a student was reviled by the leader during a heated conversati

My mom has and has always had an incredible work ethic. Starting her career with no formal education past high school meant she was going to face some barriers as she fought to climb the corporate ladder. She worked long hours which meant she wasn’t always at my baseball or basketball games or was able to help me with my homework. But I never resented her. It just was the way it was. She never complained and neither did we.
But is that how it’s supposed to work? In order for someone like my mom to have the career that she is so very proud of, should the expectation be that she give up her family time?
It seems ludicrous to me and yet, in 2018 I don’t see us any further along than we were in 1998. Most organizations still cut employee’s off completely from email as they go on mat leave and they hardly plan their transition back. When they do come back, they expect them to be running on all cylinders immediately. And that first day a mom calls in sick because their kid is sick, she is often treated similar to have committed a fraudulent crime – if not in practice but definitely in tone.

The agency official said that in one case "a woman who registered her ID and credit card number on the music download site several years ago but hadn't used it in recent years received bills of purchases that she wasn't aware of".
"The amount of money she was charged over several bills totalled more than 100,000 yen (1,100 dollars)," he said.
Japan's industry and communications ministries have joined the investigation and are looking into whether personal data has been stolen. They have advised customers to carefully check their bills and report any suspicious orders.

What is the significance of the two-year transition plan announced between CBS and Turner regarding the NCAA Final Four games
------------correct----------------------
d provide a better transition for viewers than the abrupt shift from CBS to Turner for the 2014 Final Four.
“We agreed it was important that CBS maintain its presence and Turner have the ability to accelerate its presence on Final Four weekend before 2015,” McManus said.
Neither expressed concern about impact on viewers, given the migration to cable of such events as the BCS national championship game.
CBS and Turner have not discussed how they will split the regional semifinals and finals beginning next season, and they have not discussed who will call the Final Four games beginning next year.
CBS has aired the NCAA Final Four since 1982. Jim Nantz has been CBS’ lead Tournament announcer since 1991, so the two-year transition plan announced Tuesday will give him a chance to call 25 NCAA championship games leading into the 2016 switch to Turner.
This year’s Tournament drew an average audience of 10.7 million viewers, up 11 percent from 9.6 million in 2012, according to Nielsen.
For the majority of viewers who have cable, this is no big deal, of course. But there are a few cord-cutters who will miss out on the Final Four when it’s in a cable year. Sign of the times, I guess

Rakuten LinkShare reports 44% growth, with department stores and fashion driving sales
London, UK — August 22, 2013 — Today leading CPA network Rakuten LinkShare reveals growth across the network of 44% year-on-year in Q2. This is compared to 17% year-on-year growth across the wider UK e-commerce sector according to the IMRG Capgemini e-Retail Sales Index.
Fashion and shopping at department stores are responsible for much of this growth. Online sales at department stores have nearly doubled across the network when compared to the same period last year, as shoppers consider them a one-stop shop for all their needs. Sales of clothing online also continue to grow, with the network’s fashion clients reporting a 58% increase across the second quarter of the year.
To support the growing affiliate programmes across the e-commerce sector, Rakuten LinkShare has now launched an industry-standard certification programme for affiliate programme managers. This educates affiliate managers through a series of video tutorials and articles, tests proficiency across advertiser and publisher dashboards and ensures that affiliate professionals know about the latest technologies and tactics to help them grow and optimise their affiliate programmes. The certification programme is part of Rakuten LinkShare Campus.
Rakuten LinkShare isn’t the only part of the business that’s growing. Rakuten MediaForge, which offers dynamic retargeting services to retailers, has seen rapid expansion. It has experienced over 10-fold growth in the UK from Q1 to Q2 in 2013 due to more brands using the service.
Mark Haviland, MD of Rakuten LinkShare commented: “The affiliate channel is growing to support the ever-growing popularity of online shopping. This has inspired us to launch our certificati

Its iTunes offers downloads of music, games, videos and iPhone applications.
The agency official said that in one case "a woman who registered her ID and credit card number on the music download site several years ago but hadn't used it in recent years received bills of purchases that she wasn't aware of".
"The amount of money she was charged over several bills totalled more than 100,000 yen (1,100 dollars)," he said.
Japan's industry and communications ministries have joined the investigation and are looking into whether personal data has been stolen. They have advised customers to carefully check their bills and report any suspicious orders.

We are still keeping with our snowman theme for the month of January. The only problem here as been thats its very,very, very cold outside and no snow! That makes it hard for going outside to a build snowman so we decided to build a big one on our stand up freezer.
For the eyes and buttons I used a circle punch. The carrot nose is a funny shaped triangle cut from a piece of orange paper. And the scarf is a 12 x 12 cut into 3 strips of 4 inches thick.
We have also enjoyed snowman suppers made out of pancakes. The eyes and smile are chocolate chips, the buttons are pomegranate seeds, the scarf is a strip of bacon and the "snow" is plain yogurt. The kids really thought these were a fun idea.
In school we have been playing roll a snowman which the kids really love. I got the idea from this and I used this template to cut the pieces out of cardstock. I did just use a single hole punch for the eyes, cut a crocked triangle for the nose, used 3 matching buttons, paper sticks for the arms and I drew the boots. So really I just used the template for the snowman body. heheh
Since we do a lot of cookie sheet activities I decided to make the snowman pieces magnetic so they would stick on the cookie sheet. I love

d provide a better transition for viewers than the abrupt shift from CBS to Turner for the 2014 Final Four.
“We agreed it was important that CBS maintain its presence and Turner have the ability to accelerate its presence on Final Four weekend before 2015,” McManus said.
Neither expressed concern about impact on viewers, given the migration to cable of such events as the BCS national championship game.
CBS and Turner have not discussed how they will split the regional semifinals and finals beginning next season, and they have not discussed who will call the Final Four games beginning next year.
CBS has aired the NCAA Final Four since 1982. Jim Nantz has been CBS’ lead Tournament announcer since 1991, so the two-year transition plan announced Tuesday will give him a chance to call 25 NCAA championship games leading into the 2016 switch to Turner.
This year’s Tournament drew an average audience of 10.7 million viewers, up 11 percent from 9.6 million in 2012, according to Nielsen.
For the majority of viewers who have cable, this is no big deal, of course. But there are a few cord-cutters who will miss out on the Final Four when it’s in a cable year. Sign of the times, I guess

------------answer-----------------------
So what do you suppose it is that really has folks such as the failed candidate for vice-president and current U.S. Senator from Virginia, ‘Little Timmy Kaine, the most concerned? Might it be the fact that there are more Americans who are likely to die from the ‘ChiCom virus,’ or might it be, instead, that the leaders of the Communist regime in China might get their feelings hurt when President Trump refers to, and rightfully so, this virus as the “Chinese virus?” Never mind, that’s really a rhetorical question because most anyone who is the least bit familiar with Kaine’s rather shady past associations with known leftists already knows the answer to that question.
But for those who are not all that familiar with this man who finds it so easy to attack our president and to defend a communist regime, it might be worth it to take a look at Kaine’s little ‘mission/field’ trip to Honduras back in 1980 during which he embraced the Marxist-based, heretical strategy of ‘liberation theology.’ In so doing we would discover Kaine’s political formation wasn’t pro-American or pro-Catholic, what it was, was pro-Soviet. And as we set about in our effort to connect the dots buried within Kaine’s personal history it’s a rather alarming picture that soon emerges regarding his ‘adventures’ with radicals and revolutionaries in 1980s Latin America.
It was then that Timmy embraced not some reconstituted, post-Marxist version, but the hardcore, Cold War variety, an avowed Marxist ideology detrimental to the institutional Catholic Church and to the United States. So I would argue that we have more than sufficient reason to call into question the ease with which Timmy willingly chooses to side with the Communist regime in China over our sitting U.S. president, as well as the American People. So the more we find out about the man the less we are all that surprised by his behavior. Behavior that should not be considered as acceptable when coming from a U.S. Senator, and would not be if he weren’t a Democrat.
Anyway, it was during a speech on the Senate floor earlier this week that Kaine said, “One more thing, quit the inflammatory China-bashing. Did this virus originate in China? Yes. But Mr. President, that does not excuse your weeks and weeks of tweeting lies and misinformation about the virus, while the leaders of other nations were taking steps to make sure their populations could be safe. The fact that the virus originated in China does not excuse the massive missteps that have led to the United States being so far behind other nations in the world in the ability to provide testing, basic testing to citizens, including citizens who have serious signs of illness.”
And he said, “The president’s decision to call this China virus or Wuhan virus or other epithets that he and members of his team use are a crass effort to deflect blame away from the acceptance of responsibility that a president should do. The buck stops with you, Mr. President. You cannot blame this on anyone else. You have to own responsibility and you should stop inflammatory China-bashing that is exposing Asian Americans in this country to prejudice.” I fail to understand what’s wrong with calling this virus exactly what it is. This virus started in Communist China and had they chosen not to hide it for as long as they did things would now be very different.
And of course Kaine laid all responsibility for any delays in America’s response at the president’s feet. But also, as expected, Kaine made virtually no mention of the fact that in mid-January, both Communist China and the World Health Organization were still emphatically assuring the rest of the world that the ‘Chinese virus’ could NOT be spread person-to person. And Timmy also failed to mention Dr. Anthony Fauci’s claim that President Trump’s early decision to close off travel from Communist China, and later Europe, may have bought the U.S. time in dealing with the crisis that other nations did not have. But hey, why would Timmy bother

What are the key different types of material behavior described in the text, and how do they respond to applied stress
------------correct----------------------
nearly elastic region.
It is most common for analysts in solid mechanics to use linear material models, due to ease of computation. However, real materials often exhibit non-linear behavior. As new materials are used and old ones are pushed to their limits, non-linear material models are becoming more common.
These are basic models that describe how a solid responds to an applied stress:
Elasticity - When an applied stress is removed, the material returns to its undeformed state. Linearly elastic materials, those that deform proportionally to the applied load, can be described by the linear elasticity equations such as Hooke's law.
Viscoelasticity - These are materials that behave elastically, but also have damping: when the stress is applied and removed, work has to be done against the damping effects and is converted in heat within the material resulting in a hysteresis loop in the stress-strain curve. This implies that the material response has time-dependence.
Plasticity - Materials that behave elastically generally do so when the applied stress is less than a yield value. When the stress is greater than the yield stress, the material behaves plastically and does not return to its previous state. That is, deformation that occurs after yield is permanent.
Viscoplasticity - Combines theories of viscoelasticity and plasticity and applies to materials like gels and mud.
Thermoelasticity - There is coupling of mechanical with thermal responses. In general, thermoelasticity is concerned with elastic solids under conditions that are neither isothermal nor adiabatic. The simplest theory involves the Fourier's law of heat conduction, as opposed to advanced theories with physically more realistic models.
1873: Carlo Alberto Castigliano presented his dissertation "Intorno ai sistemi elastici", which contains his theorem for computing displacement as partial derivative of the strain energy. This theorem includes the method of least work as a special case
1874: Otto Mohr formalized the idea of a statically indeterminate structure.
1936: Hardy Cross' publication of the moment distribution method, an important innovation in the design of continuous frames.
1941: Alexander Hrennikoff solved the discretization of plane elasticity problems using a lattice framework
1942: R. Courant divided a domain into finite subregions
1956: J. Turner, R. W. Clough, H. C. Martin, and L. J. Topp's paper on the "Stiffness and Deflection of Complex Structures" introduces the name "finite-element method" and is widely recognized as the first comprehensive treatment of the method as it is known today

What challenges did Michelle Berg's mother face in her career due to her work ethic and family commitments
------------correct----------------------
By: Michelle Berg
My mom has and has always had an incredible work ethic. Starting her career with no formal education past high school meant she was going to face some barriers as she fought to climb the corporate ladder. She worked long hours which meant she wasn’t always at my baseball or basketball games or was able to help me with my homework. But I never resented her. It just was the way it was. She never complained and neither did we.
But is that how it’s supposed to work? In order for someone like my mom to have the career that she is so very proud of, should the expectation be that she give up her family time?
It seems ludicrous to me and yet, in 2018 I don’t see us any further along than we were in 1998. Most organizations still cut employee’s off completely from email as they go on mat leave and they hardly plan their transition back. When they do come back, they expect them to be running on all cylinders immediately. And that first day a mom calls in sick because their kid is sick, she is often treated similar to have committed a fraudulent crime – if not in practice but definitely in tone.
At the end of the day, businesses need to figure out that women make up a significant part of the workforce and that only 18% of women are childless by the time they reach age 45. Figuring out how to accommodate families must beco

numerous paintings, including some space scenes. Using their new skills, the children drew their cosmos the way they see it. They discovered how to use various drawing and paint-mixing techniques, named their paintings, and told one another about their unique planets.
For the Moscow office of BEITEN BURKHARDT, this event was a precious experience, giving us the chance to see the universe through the eyes of children in addition to our day-to-day legal work.

What essential things do babies need according to the text
------------correct----------------------
E EXCELLENT TIPS
1- Already mentioned the rent.
2-When buying onesies… make sure you get the ones you can place the child ONTO and do up AROUND them. Nobody has time for this ‘over the head’ bull. Zippers are preferable. Let me explain:
3- The hospital says all you need to wipe pooey bums is wet cotton balls. They are wrong. Actual wipes… (believe it or not)… do a much better job. (Which isn’t difficult, because ironically cotton balls, suck balls)
4- Okay this is serious. Zip-up swaddles. Genius. Also the reason I am a semi normal person again. Time is money, and NOBODY has time to be making kebabs out of little kicking and punching munchkins at 2am, 4am, 6am, 8am… need I continue? Once the angel gets used to the zip-up swaddle, they will know it means bed-time and off they go to beautiful dreamland. If they are as brilliant as my kid, they will then sleep for 7 hours. (It’s my blog, I’ll say what I want about my child being the best.)
5- ALSO SERIOUS. the Haakka milk suction cup. GENIUS. When I am feeding little gorgeousface, I put the suction cup on the other boob. I get up to 90 mils without doing a damn thing. 90mils = one feed = a margarita. Product sold.
AND HERE … I SHALL HELP YOU WITH EMOTIONS…
1- There are going to be times, when you feel fat, ugly, really sticky, angry & alone. When that happens, get out of the nightclub, get a cab, and make your way back to you family…
😉 No but seriously. Some days with your baby are going to feel really foreign. Like you are waiting for the real parents to get back, so you can get your babysitting bucks and go to the movies.
But like everything, it passes. I promise. Everything is a phase. Even everything your baby does and is, is just a phase. I am already missing my little tiny newborn … and I haven’t even had time to take my toenail polish off. You will be okay.
2- Mums dont quit.
Okay. Yes. I stole this from the movie ‘Bad Moms’. But it’s true. You don’t get to resign and you wouldn’t want to. That’s our job and it’s never going back up on seek.com. But the good news is. You aren’t the employee…you are the god damn CEO. So if things aren’t working. Change them. Hell, fire some people. Buy a ping pong table.
3- There is no RIGHT answer.
My own supermumma Mother taught me this. When searching relentlessly online about carriers, strollers, carseats, immunisations (sit down Byron Bay I told you once), don’t keep looking for the RIGHT answer. No one is going to tell you, THIS IS THE WAY YOU HAVE TO DO IT. Research is always changing, opinions are always changing, trends are always changing (and unfortunately this last one is the one that drives the Capitalist Mummy Market the most). So don’t think that you have to keep looking until one option is PERFECT. You wont find it. If you protect your kids from polio, you won’t be able to hang out with Alicia Silverstone. It’s just the way it is. It’s a fine balance. (You will however be able to get your kids into schools.)
So do your research.
Make an INFORMED decision.
Then BACK YOURSELF.
Be okay with other (frequently voiced) opinions.
Then back yourself again.
Then when that’s all done and you’re feeling good, go home, make a smoothie and watch Orange is The New Black with your daughter safely cooing in your arms… and don’t worry about the affects of screen time (about violent sexual female prison) on a 11 week old. It’s all good.
Or as I like to say (and would like you all to start saying also) it’s ” Setto in The Ghetto.” (copyright: Matisse)
4- Babies need 4 things. To be fed. To be clean. To be safe. To be loved.
But … like everything else up in this heezy… that’s just my opinion.
So go forth and make children. (This is mostly directed at my friends in Australia & abroad as it seems that everyone is Fiji is having babies anyway. I’m not saying I’m trendsetter. But really I am.)
Lots of love from Monty & Me!

Theory of Elasticity
Branch of mechanics concerned with solid materials and their behaviors
Solid mechanics is a vast subject because of the wide range of solid materials available, such as steel, wood, concrete, biological materials, textiles, geological materials, and plastics.
A solid is a material that can support a substantial amount of shearing force over a given time scale during a natural or industrial process or action. This is what distinctly distinguishes solids from fluids, because fluids also support normal forces which are those forces that are directed perpendicular to the material plane across from which they act and normal stress is the normal force per unit area of that material plane. Shearing forces in contrast with normal forces, act parallel rather than perpendicular to the material plane and the shearing force per unit area is called shear stress.
Therefore, solid mechanics examines the shear stress, deformation and the failure of solid materials and structures.
The most common topics covered in solid mechanics include:
stability of structures - examining whether structures can return to a given equilibrium after disturbance or partial/complete failure
dynamical systems and chaos - dealing with mechanical systems highly sensitive to their given initial position
thermomechanics - analyzing materials with models derived from principles of thermodynamics
biomechanics - solid mechanics applied to biological materials e.g. bones, heart tissue
geomechanics - solid mechanics applied to geological materials e.g. ice, soil, rock
vibrations of solids and structures - examining vibration and wave propagation from vibrating particles and structures i.e. vital in mechanical, civil, mining, aeronautical, maritime/marine, aerospace engineering
fracture and damage mechanics - dealing with crack-growth mechanics in solid materials
A material has a rest shape and its shape departs away from the rest shape due to stress. The amount of departure from rest shape is called deformation, the proportion of deformation to original size is called strain. If the applied stress is sufficiently low (or the imposed strain is small enough), almost all solid materials behave in such a way that the strain is directly proportional to the stress; the coefficient of the proportion is called the modulus of elasticity. This region of deformation is known as the li

This is by far the hardest post I have ever written.
It’s not because the topic is difficult to talk about or taboo. (Oh a ‘mummy blog’! That’s what I should do! I don’t think anyone has done that yet..)
And it’s not because I have come to some deep dark realisations about motherhood that I need to now gracefully divulge and expose.
It’s not EVEN because the baby is asleep, I am showered & fed … and would quite frankly rather take this opportunity to watch Episode 7, Season 2, of Orange Is The New Black. (Although, this is also true.)
But it’s actually because …. my brain in moosh. Mash potato pie. Peas and gravy.
HOWEVER! Bravely, I soldier on. In an effort to not let down my lovely little online community (or to lose my sweet sweet URL)… I am instead going to lose my affection for perfection and … just … roll.
So here goes.
I love my little dumpling daughter. She is adorable and giggly. We got lucky with this one. She has been sleeping through the night for just over a week now (since 9 weeks, read it and weep suckers) and henceforth I feel less like Shrek and more like Michelle McCarthy. Except her name is Melissa. (Just googled it) Moving on.
On the overall, Baby Montasarus is easy and breezy. Especially in her nappy. There is quite a lot of frequent flatulence is what I am saying here.
She is very smart. She already knows how to smile into an iPhone camera (I know I know, settle down Byron Bay, she lives on a beach in the islands she will be oooookkkaaaay). She has recently taken quite a liking to her right arm. The better of the two obviously.
I have learnt a lot in the past 11 weeks. As one would hope. Rearing the young is not for the learning procrastinators. There’s nothing like poo your hair to give you motivation.
I have systems in place. Tricks of the trade. Nappies folded into the lining of my fancy handbag. We have spare clothes hidden in the cracks and corners of things I didn’t even know existed.
We have 35 thousand baby blankets. And as previously mentioned, we live in the islands. So this was perhaps a purchasing oversight. Moving on.
I am drinking again. Hallelujah. I had a big night when baby turned One Month old. To celebrate my 11 month detox. (Did you know technically babies are actually inside you for 10 months… since you need to FINISH your 9th month to get to your due date?? This was something that FASCINATED me when I was RELISHING my time as a bloated vomit machine)
Anyway, don’t worry mums, pre-aforementioned-big-night-out I pumped milk for days in prep. I sweated and toiled over the milking machine. And since my baby is a genius, she took to the bottle like teen to a vodka cruiser. She loved it. AND… she loved coming back to the boob too. (Sorry booooout it) So yes. Now we have another little non-committal, routine rejecter in the family. Wonder. Where. She. Got. It. #freespirit (And Free Spirits for mummy!!! … except for that I pay for them. Moving on.)
All in all, being a mum is better than I ever dreamt. It’s hard. But not like how they make it out to be in the movies. (Unlike everything else … which is depicted so perfectly.)
It’s tiring for sure. One day I was so over it, I threw a chair. I also gently placed my iPhone on the ground and then kicked it lightly, so it was dramatically across the other side of the room, but the screen was protected.
I understand now why parents say it’s a job. It is. But it doesn’t have to be a boring one.
The hours are long but the payment plan is pretty good. Especially if you are like me and steal cash from your baby daddy’s wallet. #hardtruths.
So I guess my underlying message is.. GO OUT AND GET PREGNANT!
Ha. Kidding. Most ya’ll are definitely not ready. (Please cease paying $600 weekly rent in Bondi first per favore.)
But if you do decide you want a little mini me (of your own.. not a mini-matisse.. I’m done for now)… HERE ARE SOM

E EXCELLENT TIPS
1- Already mentioned the rent.
2-When buying onesies… make sure you get the ones you can place the child ONTO and do up AROUND them. Nobody has time for this ‘over the head’ bull. Zippers are preferable. Let me explain:
3- The hospital says all you need to wipe pooey bums is wet cotton balls. They are wrong. Actual wipes… (believe it or not)… do a much better job. (Which isn’t difficult, because ironically cotton balls, suck balls)
4- Okay this is serious. Zip-up swaddles. Genius. Also the reason I am a semi normal person again. Time is money, and NOBODY has time to be making kebabs out of little kicking and punching munchkins at 2am, 4am, 6am, 8am… need I continue? Once the angel gets used to the zip-up swaddle, they will know it means bed-time and off they go to beautiful dreamland. If they are as brilliant as my kid, they will then sleep for 7 hours. (It’s my blog, I’ll say what I want about my child being the best.)
5- ALSO SERIOUS. the Haakka milk suction cup. GENIUS. When I am feeding little gorgeousface, I put the suction cup on the other boob. I get up to 90 mils without doing a damn thing. 90mils = one feed = a margarita. Product sold.
AND HERE … I SHALL HELP YOU WITH EMOTIONS…
1- There are going to be times, when you feel fat, ugly, really sticky, angry & alone. When that happens, get out of the nightclub, get a cab, and make your way back to you family…
😉 No but seriously. Some days with your baby are going to feel really foreign. Like you are waiting for the real parents to get back, so you can get your babysitting bucks and go to the movies.
But like everything, it passes. I promise. Everything is a phase. Even everything your baby does and is, is just a phase. I am already missing my little tiny newborn … and I haven’t even had time to take my toenail polish off. You will be okay.
2- Mums dont quit.
Okay. Yes. I stole this from the movie ‘Bad Moms’. But it’s true. You don’t get to resign and you wouldn’t want to. That’s our job and it’s never going back up on seek.com. But the good news is. You aren’t the employee…you are the god damn CEO. So if things aren’t working. Change them. Hell, fire some people. Buy a ping pong table.
3- There is no RIGHT answer.
My own supermumma Mother taught me this. When searching relentlessly online about carriers, strollers, carseats, immunisations (sit down Byron Bay I told you once), don’t keep looking for the RIGHT answer. No one is going to tell you, THIS IS THE WAY YOU HAVE TO DO IT. Research is always changing, opinions are always changing, trends are always changing (and unfortunately this last one is the one that drives the Capitalist Mummy Market the most). So don’t think that you have to keep looking until one option is PERFECT. You wont find it. If you protect your kids from polio, you won’t be able to hang out with Alicia Silverstone. It’s just the way it is. It’s a fine balance. (You will however be able to get your kids into schools.)
So do your research.
Make an INFORMED decision.
Then BACK YOURSELF.
Be okay with other (frequently voiced) opinions.
Then back yourself again.
Then when that’s all done and you’re feeling good, go home, make a smoothie and watch Orange is The New Black with your daughter safely cooing in your arms… and don’t worry about the affects of screen time (about violent sexual female prison) on a 11 week old. It’s all good.
Or as I like to say (and would like you all to start saying also) it’s ” Setto in The Ghetto.” (copyright: Matisse)
4- Babies need 4 things. To be fed. To be clean. To be safe. To be loved.
But … like everything else up in this heezy… that’s just my opinion.
So go forth and make children. (This is mostly directed at my friends in Australia & abroad as it seems that everyone is Fiji is having babies anyway. I’m not saying I’m trendsetter. But really I am.)
Lots of love from Monty & Me!

Russian Protesters Do not Trust Medvedev and the System
If Russian President Dmitry Medvedev believed that his reform package was going to assuage the protest movement, then the more powerful demonstrations throughout Russia today should have disabused him.
The reform package proposed by Medvedev was extensive: It included restoring directly elected governors (currently appointed by the Kremlin), allowing them to acquire an independent power base and mature into genuine contenders for the presidency.
A politically independent public television station would be created (Medvedev also promised that in the digital television age there would be many more channels); requirements for parties and presidential candidates to get on the ballot would be liberalized.
The problem is that these proposed reforms came too late. The reforms will only affect the next national elections for parliament and president and assuming that both president and parliament complete their terms in office, this is 5 years down the road.
When reforms appear to be granted as a result of popular pressure it creates an appetite for more demands. Both these factors coalesce into the demand, uniting protesters from different political backgrounds the call for new elections.

Kefallinia is a minor airfield located south of Corfu. Coordination between Athens, Andravida and Kefallinia is unpredictable.
Expect initial descent clearance from Athens Control with late handover to Andravida approach. Late changes of STAR clearance can be expected, with the most commonly used arrival procedures via AKETO. Typical clearance would be ASTUS 1G/1P. Onward clearance from Andravida is required before proceeding beyond AKETO. Expect late handover when approaching AKETO, which frequently involves last minute holding instructions, even during periods of light traffic density and good weather.

What changes are being implemented in Voyageurs National Park regarding camping for kayakers
------------correct----------------------
INTERNATIONAL FALLS – Voyageurs National Park has long been a special place for Minnesota boaters, anglers and those who love its big, open waters and wilderness feel without being too far from creature comforts.
For kayakers, Voyageurs offers great paddling, fishing and wildlife viewing. But without a reservation system for the limited campsites, kayakers were at a distinct disadvantage when it came to claiming a spot before they were snatched up.
That's changing, however. This year, Voyageurs is offering a reservation system, reducing visitors' chances of getting stranded without a place to pitch a tent if all campsites are full.
That's good news for kayakers like Linda Pascoe, of Maple Grove, who takes annual trips to Voyageurs with a group from the Twin Cities. Because the campsites are scattered around the lakes, chances are the kayakers aren't going to get the first choice, Pascoe said.
"We're just never going to beat out the motorboat," she said. "Your whole time up there can be trying to figure out where you're staying."

INTERNATIONAL FALLS – Voyageurs National Park has long been a special place for Minnesota boaters, anglers and those who love its big, open waters and wilderness feel without being too far from creature comforts.
For kayakers, Voyageurs offers great paddling, fishing and wildlife viewing. But without a reservation system for the limited campsites, kayakers were at a distinct disadvantage when it came to claiming a spot before they were snatched up.
That's changing, however. This year, Voyageurs is offering a reservation system, reducing visitors' chances of getting stranded without a place to pitch a tent if all campsites are full.
That's good news for kayakers like Linda Pascoe, of Maple Grove, who takes annual trips to Voyageurs with a group from the Twin Cities. Because the campsites are scattered around the lakes, chances are the kayakers aren't going to get the first choice, Pascoe said.
"We're just never going to beat out the motorboat," she said. "Your whole time up there can be trying to figure out where you're staying."

me a bigger priority for businesses. The employee experience needs to be approached from a design perspective – leaders must lead with empathy for what it’s like to come back to work and programming must demonstrate real value back to new moms (and let’s face it, all parents). It’s not just about a work from home program either. Any mom will tell you that DEFINITELY isn’t the answer. But it is about creativity and innovation.
So – to all mother’s working or not – Happy Mother’s Day. You have earned the hardest and yet most rewarding job ever. Stop beating yourself up. And just remember there are no job descriptions or handbooks for this role. There are no performance reviews that are tied to higher compensation. Your kids can’t really fire you. And fortunately (or unfortunately), you can’t really resign from your post either. But working mom’s do have a voice that can be louder as part of a collective community. Just check out fairygodboss.com for an online community looking to make that difference.
By the way…any stories out there of organizations who have gotten it really right (or really wrong) for working mom’s (or dad’s who took the time off)? Would love to share and collaborate on any approaches that are being implemented to change how moms transition out and back into a company!

Adventures of a Novelty Fabric and Selvage Obsessed Quilter
Glad you stopped by!
I am a busy wife and the mom of 19 year old twins, a boy and a girl who are Sophomores at Syracuse University.
I have been quilting since the spring of 2008. I love novelty fabrics, colorful and unique.
Selvage quilting is addictive! Who knew the "junk" we cut off and threw out would be what I now save! I started a new tradition when I travel--visiting quilt stores! I particularly enjoy going to stores

Each year the Sioux became more dissatisfied and warlike. Many treaties were made with them by commissioners sent out by the United States government, but they were made only to be broken, both the government and the Indians: being equally faithless. Due to the loss of their buffalo herds, the Indians were starving. They blamed the white settlers: for their troubles, and as these troubles increased so did their hatred of the white race, though in earlier days the Sioux were friendly to white men.
By terms of a treaty signed in 1868 the Black Hills had been ceded to the Sioux Indians. After gold was discovered in the Hills in 1874 no further efforts were made to keep the white men out of the Hills. The Indians had broken their part of the treaty, and the government knew that the mines would never be worked by the Indians, so the entire agreement was set aside. (The Sioux are still trying to collect large sums of money in payment of their claims to the Black Hills.

very good with words but not very good about walking the walk and putting these ideas into practice.
The protesters could already read in the Russian press objections to the reforms. Leon Polyakov, a political scientist from the Superior School of Economics, warned that if implemented, the proposed Medvedev reforms could restore Russia to the political system of 1990s associated with instability and economic suffering. Polyakov reminded his readers that during the not so gay 1990s, parties were used as a cloak for businesses and money laundering and they proliferated by the hundreds.
The opposition is also worried that it is one thing to liberalize the requirements, it is another thing to decide that the requirements have been met. If Putin's henchmen decide to invalidate a candidate, they can simply challenge some of the signatures on nominating petitions and disqualify it.
A final suspicion is that Russia may be heading for the 1990s but it should be recalled that Russia was hardly democratic during Boris Yeltsin's presidency after he had won his confrontation with Parliament in 1993. It actually may make sense to allow the opposition to capture parliament, as under the Yeltsin Constitution the President is all powerful. This way the opposition in parliament can be blamed for things. One of the problems of the current system is that since Putin and company hold all the levers of power, there is nobody else to blame when things go wrong.

on. The incident hurt and shocked her and weeks later she was still emotionally involved in the incident while continuing to rehearse the reviler's words in her mind and feeling the pain each time she did.
She had forgiven this leader, but her emotions were rooted deeper than her words and her forgiveness was hollow and insincere. As time passed, her wound only became more infected. Her forgiveness was a surface response that she knew was Biblical and right, but it did not reach the venom that was surging through her emotional veins. The venom of reviling is long-lasting.
One day she heard a message on the power of verbal blessings and why it is essential for us to bless those who curse us. She understood this concept, and that night she could not fall asleep until she verbally blessed the leader who had reviled her.
Since then, she has continued to have freedom in her spirit from the hurts of this past event. She also has a deeper walk with the Lord as a result of this experience.
How do we do this?
Scripture provides words that can be used: Numbers 6:24-26: "The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: The Lord make His face to shine up on thee, and be gracious unto thee: The Lord lift up His countenance upon thee, and give thee peace."
When we ask God to bring His benefits to the lives of revilers, we are blessing them. I have often looked back at some of the genetic options of my family tree and can easily say, "There but for the grace of God, go I." It certainly makes it easier to have mercy and grace on others who have not chosen to walk out of circumstances and generational curses.
My prayer for blessings my enemies is that those blessings will overcome the darkness of the curses that have caused them to be so angry. If you will look back on the situation you struggle with, you will find ways that God blessed you because of it.
Let me give you a personal example that Bill Gothard shared in his booklet mentioned above. He writes, "When attendance at the Basic Youth Conflicts Seminar first began to multiply, it was something of a phenomenon and was certainly a surprise to me. I could not explain it and was therefore hesitant to talk about it to reporters. They assumed that this constituted secrecy, and two Christian magazines published articles of a defamatory nature.
" I called the writer of the first article and tried to explain what I thought he had misunderstood. He reacted, and matters became worse. When the second article was published, God prompted me to have a different response. I called the writer. When he learned that I was on the phone, he cautiously answered. I then said, 'I have called to tell you how God has used your articles to benefit my life and ministry." He was totally surprised and said, 'Oh?' I continued and explained that God had used his article to do a work in my life, and in the ministry in three very positive ways.
" First, I was forced to reexamine what I was teaching and how people perceived what I was saying. Second, it unified the people who had been to the seminar and knew that the article reflected a misunderstanding of what was being taught. Third, as a result of this reviling, people had sent in thousands of dollars to encourage me and to support the seminar ministry.
" I'm sure the writer was not expecting this response. He became warm and friendly, and thanked me for my call. God has blessed both of our ministries since that day .... and today I consider him a friend."
My prayer is that this will allow you to give some thought to another approach to your memories and wounds. Ask God to first show you good that has come from it. Ask him to let you see how He has used it for good in your life as Romans 8 promises. Then, take the above suggestion from Scripture and choose to bless the person every time the memory returns.

Japanese authorities plan to summon Apple officials this week over complaints that its iTunes online store has billed customers for downloads they never made, officials said Monday.
In at least 95 cases in Japan involving five major credit card companies, iTunes customers said they had sometimes been charged thousands of dollars, they said.
"We have seen such cases increasing, notably since autumn last year," said an official with Japan's Consumer Affairs Agency.
"The damage in those cases seems to range from a few hundred yen to several hundred thousand yen (from several dollars to several thousand dollars)."

------------question-----------------------
What key reforms does President Dmitry Medvedev's package propose
------------correct----------------------
Russian Protesters Do not Trust Medvedev and the System
If Russian President Dmitry Medvedev believed that his reform package was going to assuage the protest movement, then the more powerful demonstrations throughout Russia today should have disabused him.
The reform package proposed by Medvedev was extensive: It included restoring directly elected governors (currently appointed by the Kremlin), allowing them to acquire an independent power base and mature into genuine contenders for the presidency.

Russian Protesters Do not Trust Medvedev and the System
If Russian President Dmitry Medvedev believed that his reform package was going to assuage the protest movement, then the more powerful demonstrations throughout Russia today should have disabused him.
The reform package proposed by Medvedev was extensive: It included restoring directly elected governors (currently appointed by the Kremlin), allowing them to acquire an independent power base and mature into genuine contenders for the presidency.

What should leaders consider to improve the employee experience for working parents, according to the text
------------correct----------------------
me a bigger priority for businesses. The employee experience needs to be approached from a design perspective – leaders must lead with empathy for what it’s like to come back to work and programming must demonstrate real value back to new moms (and let’s face it, all parents). It’s not just about a work from home program either. Any mom will tell you that DEFINITELY isn’t the answer. But it is about creativity and innovation.
So – to all mother’s working or not – Happy Mother’s Day. You have earned the hardest and yet most rewarding job ever. Stop beating yourself up. And just remember there are no job descriptions or handbooks for this role. There are no performance reviews that are tied to higher compensation. Your kids can’t really fire you. And fortunately (or unfortunately), you can’t really resign from your post either. But working mom’s do have a voice that can be louder as part of a collective community. Just check out fairygodboss.com for an online community looking to make that difference.
By the way…any stories out there of organizations who have gotten it really right (or really wrong) for working mom’s (or dad’s who took the time off)? Would love to share and collaborate on any approaches that are being implemented to change how moms transition out and back into a company!

What conclusions does the author draw about Tim Kaine's political associations and his behavior regarding the COVID-19 pandemic
------------correct----------------------
So what do you suppose it is that really has folks such as the failed candidate for vice-president and current U.S. Senator from Virginia, ‘Little Timmy Kaine, the most concerned? Might it be the fact that there are more Americans who are likely to die from the ‘ChiCom virus,’ or might it be, instead, that the leaders of the Communist regime in China might get their feelings hurt when President Trump refers to, and rightfully so, this virus as the “Chinese virus?” Never mind, that’s really a rhetorical question because most anyone who is the least bit familiar with Kaine’s rather shady past associations with known leftists already knows the answer to that question.
But for those who are not all that familiar with this man who finds it so easy to attack our president and to defend a communist regime, it might be worth it to take a look at Kaine’s little ‘mission/field’ trip to Honduras back in 1980 during which he embraced the Marxist-based, heretical strategy of ‘liberation theology.’ In so doing we would discover Kaine’s political formation wasn’t pro-American or pro-Catholic, what it was, was pro-Soviet. And as we set about in our effort to connect the dots buried within Kaine’s personal history it’s a rather alarming picture that soon emerges regarding his ‘adventures’ with radicals and revolutionaries in 1980s Latin America.
It was then that Timmy embraced not some reconstituted, post-Marxist version, but the hardcore, Cold War variety, an avowed Marxist ideology detrimental to the institutional Catholic Church and to the United States. So I would argue that we have more than sufficient reason to call into question the ease with which Timmy willingly chooses to side with the Communist regime in China over our sitting U.S. president, as well as the American People. So the more we find out about the man the less we are all that surprised by his behavior. Behavior that should not be considered as acceptable when coming from a U.S. Senator, and would not be if he weren’t a Democrat.
Anyway, it was during a speech on the Senate floor earlier this week that Kaine said, “One more thing, quit the inflammatory China-bashing. Did this virus originate in China? Yes. But Mr. President, that does not excuse your weeks and weeks of tweeting lies and misinformation about the virus, while the leaders of other nations were taking steps to make sure their populations could be safe. The fact that the virus originated in China does not excuse the massive missteps that have led to the United States being so far behind other nations in the world in the ability to provide testing, basic testing to citizens, including citizens who have serious signs of illness.”
And he said, “The president’s decision to call this China virus or Wuhan virus or other epithets that he and members of his team use are a crass effort to deflect blame away from the acceptance of responsibility that a president should do. The buck stops with you, Mr. President. You cannot blame this on anyone else. You have to own responsibility and you should stop inflammatory China-bashing that is exposing Asian Americans in this country to prejudice.” I fail to understand what’s wrong with calling this virus exactly what it is. This virus started in Communist China and had they chosen not to hide it for as long as they did things would now be very different.
And of course Kaine laid all responsibility for any delays in America’s response at the president’s feet. But also, as expected, Kaine made virtually no mention of the fact that in mid-January, both Communist China and the World Health Organization were still emphatically assuring the rest of the world that the ‘Chinese virus’ could NOT be spread person-to person. And Timmy also failed to mention Dr. Anthony Fauci’s claim that President Trump’s early decision to close off travel from Communist China, and later Europe, may have bought the U.S. time in dealing with the crisis that other nations did not have. But hey, why would Timmy bother

What issue led to the confrontation between Vettori and Roberson before their scheduled fight
------------correct----------------------
“I just saw him here like three minutes ago,” Vettori told MMA Junkie. “At the end of the day, when he steps in the cage, we’ll settle it there. I was just pissed because you’re acting tough in the f-cking lobby, and we were supposed to fight in a few hours. You should have just kept your mouth shut and show up in the cage.”
Vettori (14-3-1 MMA, 4-2-1 UFC) and fellow middleweight Roberson (9-2 MMA, 4-2 UFC) were expected to meet at May’s UFC on ESPN+ 29 event in Florida. Roberson missed weight for the matchup, but Vettori agreed to a catchweight contest. However, after the official weigh-ins, “Baby K” continued to struggle with his recovery, and medical personnel ruled him ineligible to compete.
For Vettori, who had already had two other fight dates scratched due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it was an infraction he simply couldn’t let slide, leading to a now-infamous hotel confrontation the day they were scheduled meet in the octagon.
“I just wanted to talk to him and say, ‘Why the hell did you pull out?'” Vettori said. “He missed weight. I accepted, and then he still pulled out. I was like, ‘What the hell? Why did you pull out?’ Then his coach talked, and he was telling me that he fainted after the weigh-ins. Meanwhile, he was recharging, and they right away called the UFC medical team, and they brought him to the hospital, and they said his kidney values were up. But man, the kidney values would be up after a weight cut.
“But yeah, then I was about to walk off. Honestly, I was about to walk off, and just right before, I told him, ‘You know you f-cked up? You know you f-cked up? All of this is really f-cked up.’ He was like, ‘Yeah, I know.’ This and that. Then I was about to walk off, and the moment I’m walking off, he looks at me, and he’s like, ‘Oh, but I heard you said that I’m scared to fight you.’ I’m like, ‘Of course I said that, and

Vettori (14-3-1 MMA, 4-2-1 UFC) and fellow middleweight Roberson (9-2 MMA, 4-2 UFC) were expected to meet at May’s UFC on ESPN+ 29 event in Florida. Roberson missed weight for the matchup, but Vettori agreed to a catchweight contest. However, after the official weigh-ins, “Baby K” continued to struggle with his recovery, and medical personnel ruled him ineligible to compete.
For Vettori, who had already had two other fight dates scratched due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it was an infraction he simply couldn’t let slide, leading to a now-infamous hotel confrontation the day they were scheduled meet in the octagon.
“I just wanted to talk to him and say, ‘Why the hell did you pull out?'” Vettori said. “He missed weight. I accepted, and then he still pulled out. I was like, ‘What the hell? Why did you pull out?’ Then his coach talked, and he was telling me that he fainted after the weigh-ins. Meanwhile, he was recharging, and they right away called the UFC medical team, and they brought him to the hospital, and they said his kidney values were up. But man, the kidney values would be up after a weight cut.
“But yeah, then I was about to walk off. Honestly, I was about to walk off, and just right before, I told him, ‘You know you f-cked up? You know you f-cked up? All of this is really f-cked up.’ He was like, ‘Yeah, I know.’ This and that. Then I was about to walk off, and the moment I’m walking off, he looks at me, and he’s like, ‘Oh, but I heard you said that I’m scared to fight you.’ I’m like, ‘Of course I said that, and

What is the author's overall feeling about motherhood based on their experiences in the text
------------correct----------------------
This is by far the hardest post I have ever written.
It’s not because the topic is difficult to talk about or taboo. (Oh a ‘mummy blog’! That’s what I should do! I don’t think anyone has done that yet..)
And it’s not because I have come to some deep dark realisations about motherhood that I need to now gracefully divulge and expose.
It’s not EVEN because the baby is asleep, I am showered & fed … and would quite frankly rather take this opportunity to watch Episode 7, Season 2, of Orange Is The New Black. (Although, this is also true.)
But it’s actually because …. my brain in moosh. Mash potato pie. Peas and gravy.
HOWEVER! Bravely, I soldier on. In an effort to not let down my lovely little online community (or to lose my sweet sweet URL)… I am instead going to lose my affection for perfection and … just … roll.
So here goes.
I love my little dumpling daughter. She is adorable and giggly. We got lucky with this one. She has been sleeping through the night for just over a week now (since 9 weeks, read it and weep suckers) and henceforth I feel less like Shrek and more like Michelle McCarthy. Except her name is Melissa. (Just googled it) Moving on.
On the overall, Baby Montasarus is easy and breezy. Especially in her nappy. There is quite a lot of frequent flatulence is what I am saying here.
She is very smart. She already knows how to smile into an iPhone camera (I know I know, settle down Byron Bay, she lives on a beach in the islands she will be oooookkkaaaay). She has recently taken quite a liking to her right arm. The better of the two obviously.
I have learnt a lot in the past 11 weeks. As one would hope. Rearing the young is not for the learning procrastinators. There’s nothing like poo your hair to give you motivation.
I have systems in place. Tricks of the trade. Nappies folded into the lining of my fancy handbag. We have spare clothes hidden in the cracks and corners of things I didn’t even know existed.
We have 35 thousand baby blankets. And as previously mentioned, we live in the islands. So this was perhaps a purchasing oversight. Moving on.
I am drinking again. Hallelujah. I had a big night when baby turned One Month old. To celebrate my 11 month detox. (Did you know technically babies are actually inside you for 10 months… since you need to FINISH your 9th month to get to your due date?? This was something that FASCINATED me when I was RELISHING my time as a bloated vomit machine)
Anyway, don’t worry mums, pre-aforementioned-big-night-out I pumped milk for days in prep. I sweated and toiled over the milking machine. And since my baby is a genius, she took to the bottle like teen to a vodka cruiser. She loved it. AND… she loved coming back to the boob too. (Sorry booooout it) So yes. Now we have another little non-committal, routine rejecter in the family. Wonder. Where. She. Got. It. #freespirit (And Free Spirits for mummy!!! … except for that I pay for them. Moving on.)
All in all, being a mum is better than I ever dreamt. It’s hard. But not like how they make it out to be in the movies. (Unlike everything else … which is depicted so perfectly.)
It’s tiring for sure. One day I was so over it, I threw a chair. I also gently placed my iPhone on the ground and then kicked it lightly, so it was dramatically across the other side of the room, but the screen was protected.
I understand now why parents say it’s a job. It is. But it doesn’t have to be a boring one.
The hours are long but the payment plan is pretty good. Especially if you are like me and steal cash from your baby daddy’s wallet. #hardtruths.
So I guess my underlying message is.. GO OUT AND GET PREGNANT!
Ha. Kidding. Most ya’ll are definitely not ready. (Please cease paying $600 weekly rent in Bondi first per favore.)
But if you do decide you want a little mini me (of your own.. not a mini-matisse.. I’m done for now)… HERE ARE SOM

clearance,Andravida may be implicitly expecting inbound flights to cross AKETO at 8000ft altitude. Flights not able to meet the restriction can expect to be directed hold at AKETO. If a crossing altitude at AKETO has not been specified, it is strongly recommended that flight crews request clarification from Athens and reconfirm with Andravida on handover. Note the middle airspace danger area to the south west of KFN VOR.
Steep glidepath of 3.4 degrees.
RUNWAY AND AIRPORT FACILITIES
For landing on Rwy 32 the last 1500 ft of runway slopes rapidly down to the coast, only becoming visible during the latter part of the landing run.
Expect turbulence on final approach to rwy 14/32 when easterly winds prevail from 050 degrees to 130 degrees at 15 KT or more.
Birds in vicinity of airport.

Theory of Elasticity
Branch of mechanics concerned with solid materials and their behaviors
Solid mechanics is a vast subject because of the wide range of solid materials available, such as steel, wood, concrete, biological materials, textiles, geological materials, and plastics.
A solid is a material that can support a substantial amount of shearing force over a given time scale during a natural or industrial process or action. This is what distinctly distinguishes solids from fluids, because fluids also support normal forces which are those forces that are directed perpendicular to the material plane across from which they act and normal stress is the normal force per unit area of that material plane. Shearing forces in contrast with normal forces, act parallel rather than perpendicular to the material plane and the shearing force per unit area is called shear stress.
Therefore, solid mechanics examines the shear stress, deformation and the failure of solid materials and structures.
The most common topics covered in solid mechanics include:
stability of structures - examining whether structures can return to a given equilibrium after disturbance or partial/complete failure
dynamical systems and chaos - dealing with mechanical systems highly sensitive to their given initial position
thermomechanics - analyzing materials with models derived from principles of thermodynamics
biomechanics - solid mechanics applied to biological materials e.g. bones, heart tissue
geomechanics - solid mechanics applied to geological materials e.g. ice, soil, rock
vibrations of solids and structures - examining vibration and wave propagation from vibrating particles and structures i.e. vital in mechanical, civil, mining, aeronautical, maritime/marine, aerospace engineering
fracture and damage mechanics - dealing with crack-growth mechanics in solid materials
A material has a rest shape and its shape departs away from the rest shape due to stress. The amount of departure from rest shape is called deformation, the proportion of deformation to original size is called strain. If the applied stress is sufficiently low (or the imposed strain is small enough), almost all solid materials behave in such a way that the strain is directly proportional to the stress; the coefficient of the proportion is called the modulus of elasticity. This region of deformation is known as the li
