------------question-----------------------
What are the two main versions of Dynamics 365 indicated in the text segment
------------correct----------------------
with LinkedIn to manage all aspects of HR. This includes attracting, hiring, and onboarding new employees in managing HR programs.
Editions of Dynamics 365
Dynamics 365 is sold in two main versions, the Business Edition for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs or SMBs), and the Enterprise Edition intended for medium to large-sized organisations.
Dynamics 365, Enterprise Edition
The Dynamics 365 Enterprise Edition includes Dynamics CRM applications (field service, sales, project service automation, and customer service) as well as Microsoft PowerApps. This also includes Microsoft’s top of the line ERP solution, Dynamics 365 for operations.
- Finance and Operations
- Formerly known as Microsoft Dynamics AX, the operations module contains all of the finance and operations functionality of Dynamics AX.
- The CRM component of Dynamics 365 offers all of the lead management and sales process functionality you need in sales (more specifically, the salesperson)
- Microsoft Dynamics
- No longer exists as a separate module. Dynamics 365, in partnership with Adobe, offers a more comprehensive and at the same time, integrated marketing tool.
- Customer Service
- Integrates CRM functionality, new functionality, existing Parature functionality, and more Microsoft partnerships.
- Project Service
- Allows for estimating and scheduling projects in Dynamics 365. Perfect for professional service organisations.
- Field Service
- This module leverages the mobility of the Microsoft cloud and delivers extra features required daily by field staff.
- The HCM module of Dynamics 365 does not come bundled with the software and can be purchased separately.
- The Retail (POS) module of Dynamics 365 does not come bundled with the software and can be purchased separately.
Dynamics 365, Business Edition
The Business Edition of Dynamics 365 is the evolution of project Madeira, the cloud-based ERP/CRM. Microsoft recommends Dynamics 365, Business Edition for companies with employees ranging from 100 to 250. It has three modules:
- Finance & Operations
- The finance module is based on Microsoft Dynamics NAV, albeit with certain functionalities removed such as the manufacturing module.
- The sales module of Dynamics 365, Business Edition is based on Dynamics CRM and optimised for SMB customers. That is to say the level of customers catered to by a small or medium business.
- The module will be a partnership with Adobe, much like the Enterprise edition.
Dynamics 365 Isn’t Replacing Other Microsoft Dynamics ERP or CRM Products
Although most of the new apps available in Dynamics 365 are based on previous Dynamics products, the latest apps are in no way a replacement for Dynamics AX, NAV, GP, SL, or CRM. All of which will remain available as is for those that wish to use them. Dynamics 365 is simply an alternative way to license and utilise business applications, albeit one with significant additional functions.
Why Should You Choose Dynamics 365?
By combining the CRM and ERP module of Dynamics 365 and ERP with Microsoft’s productivity applications, users get an integrated and intelligent perspective of data about customer records, transactions, behaviours and preferences. This includes information about orders, inventory and shipping. If that is not enough, Dynamics 365 has excellent features and additional analytical insight tools for decision-makers.
The most significant advantage of Dynamics 365 is the strong integration it allows with other Microsoft business applications. For businesses that rely heavily on Office 365, Outlook or Azure, Dynamics 365 offers more beneficial union with sister products than most other CRM systems (most rely a great deal on third-party plug-ins). Microsoft is also expanding its collection of third-party applications that integrate with Dynamics 365 through the AppSource store.
Microsoft Dynamics 365 Pricing
Dynamics 365 pricing, compared to its primary competitors, Salesforce, SAP and Oracle, is also a benefit. It comes with bundle and role-based licensing, which are two of the more commonly preferred pricing features.
- Customer Engagement Plan
- The engagement plan for customers offered by Microsoft Dynamics 365 helps build and support customer relationships for your organisation.
- $115 Per user/month
- Unified Operations Plan
- Get full use of apps that help connect and manage your business operations.
- $190 Per user/month
- Dynamics 365 Plan (Best value)
- The best value for money option. You get full use of all applications in one comprehensive, cost-efficient option.
- $210 Per user/month
- Applications and offers
- Start with what you need and then upgrade to plans as your business grows.
- MS Dynamics 365 Pricing will vary depending on the module that you select.
While CRM focuses on the customer, ERPs focus on the business itself and how it operates. Nonetheless, both types of systems allow for company-wide sharing of information. ERP enables organisations to plan for problems before they become persistent. Obstacles in business operations can hinder the analytical thought process and thereby stop companies from focusing on the data rather than operations. In this way, ERPs offer the best way to organise business central processes.
Therefore, MS Dynamics 365 is an exceptionally well thought out toolbox with all the right tools, and of just the right size. Just as the tools can make or break an artisan, management software can either spell disaster for or skyrocket a business depending on whether the tools themselves function correctly and whether it is an adequate fit for your business and this is where Dynamics 365 comes in. The software will be tailored to your needs in such a way that there is never any question of whether Dynamics 365 is the right fit for you.

What difficulties has Fresh & Easy faced in attracting customers, as mentioned in the text
------------correct----------------------
the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp.
"It's really bad timing when we are struggling to add every job we can," she said.
If Fresh & Easy starts shuttering stores, that could hurt the fragile retail real estate market by adding "a bunch of empty spaces" on the market, she said.
Of course, the other players in the grocery industry would benefit, although Fresh & Easy was never able to command much market share, she said.
"At Fresh & Easy, they just didn't catch people's imagination or really draw them in. I know they put in a lot of research before building their stores, but this didn't quite work," Ritter-Martinez said. "With Fresh & Easy, you had very spare interiors, at least the ones I visited. It wasn't a very warm, inviting space."
Not only has it been struggling to draw customers, but Fresh & Easy also has had a contentious relationship with labor groups. The chain is nonunion, and has rejected labor groups' calls for talks.
Union activists have staged protests in front of the chain's stores and called for a boycott.
The United Food & Commercial Workers International Union, which represents 1.3 million workers mostly in grocery and retail stores, blamed mismanagement for Fresh & Easy's financial problems and the potential job losses from the strategic review.
"These job losses could have been avoided if Tesco had chosen to engage with community stakeholders and its customers to address the many underlying problems and warning signs of the troubled Fresh & Easy model," the UFCW said in a statement Wednesday. "We call on Tesco and Fresh & Easy executives to include all community and labor stakeholders as the company undergoes this review process."
El Segundo Mayor Carl Jacobson said there is little the city can do to prevent a sale or potential closure of Fresh & Easy since such a decision would be made at Tesco's headquarters in England rather than locally.
"There's not much we can do to influence what England does," Jacobson said.
He noted that the immediate impact on El Segundo, if the chain were to move or close, would be minimal.
"We really don't have many (Fresh & Easy) employees here in El Segundo. They don't have a store here," Jacobson said. "We have valued them as a business in town, but it has only been as a corporate headquarters and they have downsized that quite a bit over the years."
In August, Fresh & Easy cut about 40 employees at its headquarters. The layoffs were in the real estate department responsible for opening new stores, as the chain slowed its formerly torrid pace of expansion to cut costs.
In 2010, the chain announced it would temporarily "mothball" 13 stores until economic conditions in those areas improved. Only one of the targeted stores was in California, the Moreno Valley location in the Inland Empire. Six stores were in Nevada and another six in Arizona.

Husband criticizes Supreme Court decision to free ex-wife who hired hit man to kill him
In an online response to the Supreme Court decision to free Nicole Ryan, her ex-husband denies he was an abuser and says she tried to kill him for money.
Share via Email
The Nova Scotia man whose ex-wife tried to hire a hit man to kill him called the Supreme Court’s decision to set her free a “farce” and a “disgrace” in an online video.
Over the course of a nine-minute video posted Sunday, Michael Ryan switched between addressing the public and his ex-wife Nicole, who now uses her maiden name of Doucet, and the public at large. He denies he was an abusive husband and tells Doucet her actions have hurt him and their daughter.
“I strongly believe the Supreme Court of Canada has denied the truth,” he said. “The public is still deceived by Nicole Ryan’s false allegations that I was an abusive husband and my side of the story has still not been heard,” he said.
After having been acquitted twice in Nova Scotia for counselling to commit murder, Doucet’s case was stayed by the Supreme Court on Friday, freeing her and halting any further prosecution.
She was arrested in 2009 after she unknowingly hired an undercover RCMP officer to kill her ex-husband for $25,000.
Doucet argued in court that she acted under duress because of the abuse she endured for years from her husband.
In its decision, the Supreme Court emphasized that Doucet was the victim of a violent, abusive and controlling husband, and believed his threats that he would seriously hurt or kill her and their daughter.
“It was the wrong thing to do, yes. But it

How can field service software help organizations manage subcontractors effectively
------------correct----------------------
down to the Millennials who won’t have the same experiences working in the field. Augmented reality and virtual reality will offer new ways for Millennials to learn, using technology they are already familiar with.
The Field Service Software Strategy to the Resource Gap
With the resource gap widening, there is another option field service organizations are exploring more and more to get the technicians they need to fulfill the work they have. Many are turning to field service software that can help them with the hiring and on-boarding of subcontractors in order to outsource their work to the market. In fact, 76 percent of field service organizations outsource a part of the work their organization does, that doesn’t just meet the growing demand, but also increases their coverage area, as they can move into new territory without having to hire full-time workers, while also being able to be flexible in their current offerings when demand fluctuates.
Subcontractors allow a field service organization to offer more services than they have been able to before, without having to hire on new technicians, and with a field service software, they can be managed the same as any full-time technician would. Work orders can still be sent to a mobile app, checklists can be completed, work orders signed and returned electronically, while integrations to accounting software will ensure that not only is the invoice created quickly, but so too is the payment voucher to have the subcontractor paid quickly.
Field service management software also comes with the tools needed to better schedule your technicians for more enhanced dispatching, and analytical tools make it easy to start to find where revenue leakage is happening in your business in order to make adjustments, even with a short staff.
Combine Millennials with Field Service Software
Combing millennials with field service software is a winning combination, as a field service management software can drastically change how your organization runs, removing many of the manual processes, with technology that is already being used by today’s Millennials on their own smart phones and tablets. It’s embracing the technology of today as well as embracing the people and technicians of today and using the tools they know how to use. Service can be taught, and with changes being made that has seen the industry go to a more customer service approach, hiring Millennials with great customer service skills will go a long way to retaining customers in the future.
And with the industry moving to more advanced technology, such as augmented reality, virtual reality and IoT, it’s going to need technicians who understand how that technology works. And baby boomers will have to training in the new technology, which gives the Millennial worker the upper hand in not needing as much training and truly embracing an approach that has a field service software at the heart of an organization

What occasion prompted the author to work on a super-secret project
------------correct----------------------
consists of work, baby, wife (which usually consists of a few minutes to talk about our day), and sleep. Of course, in between all that I have to find time to shovel food into my piehole. So when I do have free time, it’s pretty amazing. Getting to go out and play photographer is unbelievably liberating, but even sitting down to read at the end of the day is simply beyond words. So my “me time” is something I’ve come to covet quite a bit (“My preeeeeecious…”). So what better way to say it? Well, I suppose there’s jewelry and all that, but that’s beside the point.
With our anniversary coming up, it was the perfect opportunity to work on this project, but with free time being much more scarce these days I had to get started pronto. Free time is one thing, but free time when I could work on a super-secret project? That’s something completely different. It took over a month to put together (with a whole lot of hustle towards the end), but thanks to lots and lots of baby naps, a children’s percussion set from Guitar Center, and mixing input from an extra pair of ears (thanks Parag!), it all came together quite well.
Happy anniversary, Red. This is me saying “I love you.”

aid.
Sue Elder, another volunteer, also spoke of spending hours at the facility.
“I won’t call it a shelter. A shelter is a safe, warm, loving place,” said Elder, who admitted she loves dogs more than she does most people. “I get there at 10 a.m. and the animals are laying in their own feces and urine. The first thing (the employees) should be doing is getting those little, innocent animals out of their feces.”
Fontenot agreed the volunteers are playing a critical role at the shelter and thanked them for their efforts.
As for the workers, Fontenot urged the volunteers to understand the workload. The animal shelter collects stray dogs and cats from throughout the parish and its 12 municipalities. It is also home to abandoned horses, donkeys and other farm animals.
“The staff is often out on calls all day long and sometimes all night long,” Fontenot said.
Fontenot said he is currently working with the LSU veterinary school, which has agreed to visit the shelter and offer advice on how it can be improved.
“We have the goal to make it better. It got better the first day I became involved but we have room for improvement,” Fontenot said.
His assurances didn’t satisfy the volunteers or some members of the committee. The committee instead agreed to forward to the full council a call for the establishment of an investigative committee to review the shelter and its operations.
Councilman Jerry Red said that committee should be made up of two to three council members and three to five volunteers.
“I’d like them to come back in six months and give us an update,” Red said.
Fontenot said, as with all aspects of parish government, cost has to be a consideration.
“If we bring it up to a premier shelter as some of the volunteers are requesting, it will cost a lot of money,” Fontenot cautioned.

LONDON (Dec. 30)
Israel tried and failed to purchase arms from Finland, the Times of London reported here today from Helsinki. The correspondent asserted that Israelis recently sought to purchase mortars and other weapons from Finnish manufacturers but the government refused to approve such sales. Helsinki was reported to have felt that selling arms to Israel might lead to international complications for the tiny state perched on the Soviet Union’s northern border.
A moratorium on arms shipments to the Middle East was urged today by the Times of London in an editorial which asserted that

the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp.
"It's really bad timing when we are struggling to add every job we can," she said.
If Fresh & Easy starts shuttering stores, that could hurt the fragile retail real estate market by adding "a bunch of empty spaces" on the market, she said.
Of course, the other players in the grocery industry would benefit, although Fresh & Easy was never able to command much market share, she said.
"At Fresh & Easy, they just didn't catch people's imagination or really draw them in. I know they put in a lot of research before building their stores, but this didn't quite work," Ritter-Martinez said. "With Fresh & Easy, you had very spare interiors, at least the ones I visited. It wasn't a very warm, inviting space."
Not only has it been struggling to draw customers, but Fresh & Easy also has had a contentious relationship with labor groups. The chain is nonunion, and has rejected labor groups' calls for talks.
Union activists have staged protests in front of the chain's stores and called for a boycott.
The United Food & Commercial Workers International Union, which represents 1.3 million workers mostly in grocery and retail stores, blamed mismanagement for Fresh & Easy's financial problems and the potential job losses from the strategic review.
"These job losses could have been avoided if Tesco had chosen to engage with community stakeholders and its customers to address the many underlying problems and warning signs of the troubled Fresh & Easy model," the UFCW said in a statement Wednesday. "We call on Tesco and Fresh & Easy executives to include all community and labor stakeholders as the company undergoes this review process."
El Segundo Mayor Carl Jacobson said there is little the city can do to prevent a sale or potential closure of Fresh & Easy since such a decision would be made at Tesco's headquarters in England rather than locally.
"There's not much we can do to influence what England does," Jacobson said.
He noted that the immediate impact on El Segundo, if the chain were to move or close, would be minimal.
"We really don't have many (Fresh & Easy) employees here in El Segundo. They don't have a store here," Jacobson said. "We have valued them as a business in town, but it has only been as a corporate headquarters and they have downsized that quite a bit over the years."
In August, Fresh & Easy cut about 40 employees at its headquarters. The layoffs were in the real estate department responsible for opening new stores, as the chain slowed its formerly torrid pace of expansion to cut costs.
In 2010, the chain announced it would temporarily "mothball" 13 stores until economic conditions in those areas improved. Only one of the targeted stores was in California, the Moreno Valley location in the Inland Empire. Six stores were in Nevada and another six in Arizona.

Volunteers call for animal shelter reformation
The St. Landry Parish Council is expected to call for a formal investigation into the operations of the parish animal shelter following complaints by volunteers.
Volunteers with Friends Underwriting Rescues became involved with the shelter a few months ago to help promote adoptions of dogs and cats. But the volunteers quickly became concerned about conditions at the shelter, which they call inhumane.
Parish President Bill Fontenot has met with the group on several occasions since then and promised to make improvements.
A number of employees at the shelter have been dismissed, an exercise track for the animals has been added and parking lot improvements have been made. A new 40-by-60-foot kennel for large dogs is currently under construction.
But this week the volunteers came before the council’s Public Works Committee to argue more is needed.
From comments by committee members, conditions at the shelter are a function of when you visit.
Both Council members Dexter Brown and Fekisha Miller-Matthews spoke of separate surprise visits to the shelter, located beside the parish airport just north of Opelousas.
Both came in the afternoon and both said they were pleased with what they found.
“I visited Monday and basically I was happy with what I saw. It was very clean. It was clean enough the Pope could have had lunch there,” Brown said.
On the other hand, Councilman Alvin Stelly said he visited in the morning and didn’t like what he saw at all. “It was a disgrace,” Stelly said.
Jennie Casanova, the founder of FUR, argued the difference is her volunteers.
“We got involved to decrease the euthanasia rate. Instead we are spending hours cleaning the cages. As soon as the volunteers arrive, the staff walks away and doesn’t return,” Casanova s

ts affected by the change,” Delgado said.
O’Brien said that while this tightening may have resulted in dropping out of UWRF, it also pushes students to succeed and encourages them to work harder, so it was not necessarily a bad thing.
This new administrator would sit on Chancellor Dean Van Galen’s council and report directly to the chancellor about how to increase enrollment numbers and retain the students who do enroll to build the success of the University.
While the position’s boundaries are not firmly established, that is the basic idea, said Paul Shepherd, director of Student Life.
A search and screen committee will be put together after the position is defined and officially posted for candidates to apply.
Shepherd said that this will be a national search to find the best candidate.
For O’Brien, the fact that this position is being created shows her how big of a concern this is for the future of UWRF.
As a student, she said that the different programs on campus are possible because of the size of the student body and that the diversity seen at UWRF in the variety of organizations, membership opportunities and personalities are “important to the student experience.”
With the number of students decreasing, so does the opportunities that are available now, said O’Brien.
Like any other search and screen committee put together on campus to bring in new professors or administration, it is required to have a student on the board to represent student interest in the search of a candidate.
O’Brien said that a good candidate to represent the student body in this decision would be someone who is dedicated to attending meetings and open-minded to the different candidates that may come before them.
Students interested in the position should contact Student Senate

What is the main reason the NFL can ignore negotiations with officials and still maintain demand for its games
------------correct----------------------
The NFL and the negotiations between the officials is a pathetic. There is no negotiation.
What the NFL is doing is very simple. They are flexing their muscles, proving to everyone that they hold the upper hand in all negotiations and business deals. It does not matter with whom; officials, TV sponsors, stadium vendors, or stadium leasers (hello St. Louis). The NFL can do whatever they want. Why? Steve Young put it best on the Monday Night Football post game show when explaining what is going on in the negotiations between the NFL and the officials. He stated, “The demand for the game is inelastic.”
What he means is there is almost nothing that can affect the demand for the NFL among the people that watch the games and buy the tickets. Regardless of who’s officiating.
Last year’s player lockout is about the only thing that has and will ever come close to the NFL backing down. The NFL stood to lose millions in revenue if they locked the players out for a whole season.

The NFL and the negotiations between the officials is a pathetic. There is no negotiation.
What the NFL is doing is very simple. They are flexing their muscles, proving to everyone that they hold the upper hand in all negotiations and business deals. It does not matter with whom; officials, TV sponsors, stadium vendors, or stadium leasers (hello St. Louis). The NFL can do whatever they want. Why? Steve Young put it best on the Monday Night Football post game show when explaining what is going on in the negotiations between the NFL and the officials. He stated, “The demand for the game is inelastic.”
What he means is there is almost nothing that can affect the demand for the NFL among the people that watch the games and buy the tickets. Regardless of who’s officiating.
Last year’s player lockout is about the only thing that has and will ever come close to the NFL backing down. The NFL stood to lose millions in revenue if they locked the players out for a whole season. Every NFL owner is a billionaire, and in their business they are guaranteed to make money whether their team goes 0-16 and nobody buys a single ticket or if they go 19-0 and win the Super Bowl. The T.V. revenue provides the NFL owners with a guaranteed profit. The only reason why the lockout was lifted on the players before the start of last season is because the NFL’s bottom line would have been affected. No games=no T.V. revenue.

A MOTHER who killed her three children after a bitter divorce battle has been found dead at Rampton high security hospital.
American Theresa Riggi, 49, who was serving 16 years in prison for the horrific crime, had only been moved recently from a facility in Scotland to the the institution in Nottinghamshire.
Riggi had stabbed Austin and Gianluca, both eight, and Cecilia, five - eight times at their second-floor Edinburgh flat.
She admitted culpable homicide on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
Riggi was held in Cornton Vale Prison, Stirling, before being transferred to secure psychiatric care.
It came more than two years after she was allegedly disfigured for life by a fellow inmate at Cornton Vale women's prison near Stirling.
Riggi was treated for her injuries in hospital after suffering a 40ft fall from the balcony of the townhouse in 2010, where twin boys Luca and Austin, eight, and daughter Cecilia, five, were found dead with suspected stab wounds.
It came several months after Riggi, 46, vanished with the children in July, after a break up with her husband Pasquale.
After she was jailed for 16 years in July 2011, Mr Riggi said: "The horrific manner in which my children died will leave an indelible mark on the rest of my life. As a father, my natural instincts were geared towards safeguarding my children from the dangers of this world.
"It pains me to the core that I was unable to protect them from the selfish, brutal and mu

What are some possible outcomes of Tesco's strategic review of Fresh & Easy
------------correct----------------------
British retail giant Tesco's ambitious venture in the U.S. grocery market under the Fresh & Easy Neighborhood Market brand could soon end.
Tesco announced Wednesday that it is conducting a strategic review of its money-losing El Segundo-based chain that could result in sale of the unit.
The announcement comes five years after Tesco opened its first store in Los Angeles.
"It is now clear that Fresh & Easy will not deliver acceptable shareholder returns on an appropriate time frame in its current form," the company said in a statement.
Tesco has hired investment bank Greenhill to help review options. The British retailer said that in recent months it has received "a number of approaches" from potential suitors interested in buying all or part of Fresh & Easy or partnering with Tesco to develop the chain.
The company will update investors on its strategic review in April, when full-year financial results are reported.
Fresh & Easy has 200 stores in California, Nevada and Arizona. The chain employs about 5,000 people, with about 300 at its El Segundo headquarters. The company also operates a sprawling food preparation kitchen and central distribution center in Riverside County.
Fresh & Easy said it will continue operations despite the strategic review.
"Our focus remains on our people and our customers. It is business as usual in our stores and we look forward to bringing our neighbors the same delicious, wholesome and affordable food they have come to expect from Fresh & Easy," the chain said in a statement.
Tesco and its CEO, Philip Clarke, have been under fire from shareholders frustrated with Fresh & Easy's drag on the company's profits.
"Whilst the business has many positives, its journey to scale and acceptable returns will take too long relative to other opportunities," Clarke said in a statement. "I have therefore decided to conduct a strategic review of Fresh & Easy, with all options under consideration."
Tesco also announced that Fresh & Easy CEO Tim Mason was leaving Wednesday after 30 years with the company.
Fresh & Easy had hoped to set itself apart in the hyper-competitive American grocery market by offering a combination of convenience and fresh food. The stores are about 10,000 square feet - roughly the size of a Trader Joe's - with a few even smaller versions having opened recently.
The idea was for busy shoppers to pop in to pick up fresh produce and healthy prepackaged meals and then pay at one of the self-checkout terminals.
While the chain has made inroads with American shoppers, that progress has been far slower than Tesco had projected.
In Tesco's third quarter interim management statement released Wednesday, the company reported that Fresh & Easy's same-store sales rose a slight 1.8 percent year over year.
Depending on what happens to Fresh & Easy, the biggest economic impact would likely be a loss of jobs, said Kimberly Ritter-Martinez, an economist with

British retail giant Tesco's ambitious venture in the U.S. grocery market under the Fresh & Easy Neighborhood Market brand could soon end.
Tesco announced Wednesday that it is conducting a strategic review of its money-losing El Segundo-based chain that could result in sale of the unit.
The announcement comes five years after Tesco opened its first store in Los Angeles.
"It is now clear that Fresh & Easy will not deliver acceptable shareholder returns on an appropriate time frame in its current form," the company said in a statement.
Tesco has hired investment bank Greenhill to help review options. The British retailer said that in recent months it has received "a number of approaches" from potential suitors interested in buying all or part of Fresh & Easy or partnering with Tesco to develop the chain.
The company will update investors on its strategic review in April, when full-year financial results are reported.
Fresh & Easy has 200 stores in California, Nevada and Arizona. The chain employs about 5,000 people, with about 300 at its El Segundo headquarters. The company also operates a sprawling food preparation kitchen and central distribution center in Riverside County.
Fresh & Easy said it will continue operations despite the strategic review.

What circumstances require surveys as defined by the WAPC regarding land development
------------correct----------------------
ment of land. Teams must first understand how the WAPC defines this process. Surveys are required when:
One: any demolition, erection, construction, alteration of or addition to any building or structure on the land;
Two: the carrying out on the land of any excavation or other works;
Three: in the case of a place to which a Conservation Order made under section 59 of the Heritage of Western Australia Act 1990 applies, any act or thing that;
(i) is likely to change the character of that place or the external appearance of any building; or
(ii) would constitute an irreversible alteration of the fabric of any building.
These forms of land development render contour surveyors in Perth necessary.
Are There any Timeline Restrictions on Topographic Surveys in Perth?
The WAPC accommodates construction schedules, affording a flexible timeline on detail survey submissions in Perth. Teams have up to four years to submit findings for projects exceeding five land lots and three years for other projects.
Should teams fail to provide their plans to the WAPC, the work of feature surveyors in Perth is then voided.
What Should Topographic Surveys Include?
The work of qualified contour surveyors in Perth - such as Xcel Surveying - should include assessments of:
- Pre-Existing Structures.
- Adjoining or Adjacent Structures.
- Retaining Walls.
- Services (including manholes and valves).
Through the all WAPC planning guidelines can be properly addressed.

l be a deciding factor, too. But why would Zynga hold such an event all about one of its least popular games?
Since its release earlier this summer, Pioneer Trail has been in decline, according to AppData. That's despite some hefty updates pushed to the game like the massive Ghost Town. Our guess is that Zynga is looking for answers as to why what was once one of its most popular games has lost its luster after what was supposed to be its revival. Check out the forum post here for all the details.

------------question-----------------------
What recent actions are being taken to address the declining retention rates at UW-River Falls
------------correct----------------------
New position created to help with retention
A new administrative position is being put together to combat decreasing retention rates that have become a concern at UW-River Falls.
“The position is quite common in many private institutions and increasingly visible among public institutions,” said Provost and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs Fernando Delgado.
“For us, creating the position signals the University’s and the Chancellor’s seriousness about building and sustaining our enrollment at a time when we are ever more dependent upon tuition and associated revenues.”
The retention rate that has been concerning administration has been slowly falling over the past five years at UWRF; last year, 68 percent of students were retained in comparison to the 73 percent that were retained five years ago.
Although the percentages may seem unreal, they resonate with other comparable universities in Wisconsin like nearby UW-Stout who experienced a 70 percent retention rate last year.
Reasons for this can vary, but Student Senate President Bobbi O’Brien, a transfer student herself, said that being involved was what helped her make a home at UWRF and that the “friendly atmosphere” only helped.
“I feel really attached to this school, so I feel involvement has plays a huge part,” she said.
O’Brien is a current member of a sorority and holds her presidency role with Senate.
She said one thing people could try to make UWRF their home as well is to get involved in something.
Delgado said other issues could be with the finance challenges of being enrolled in a four-year university and “academic preparation and adjustment.”
“We did observe that after tightening out academic probation and suspension rules two years ago we saw a nearly 10 fold increase in the number of studen

What is the primary message conveyed about the current economic environment and its impact on businesses during the speaker's experience at GIE
------------correct----------------------
Hey. What’s up? I hope you’re doing great. Hey, I’m gonna give you three takeaways from my time at GIE in October. If you don’t care about GIE, you weren’t there, don’t let me lose you here on this video because the three things I’m gonna say are what I believe to be really important and I don’t believe other people are talking about them. I’m gonna give you my unique perspective and my perspective comes from knowing hundreds and hundreds of companies in the industry that are doing anywhere from, let’s call it, 150,000 a year to way over 10 million a year. I know a lot of guys doing over 20 million a year. Let me give you that perspective because it serves higher up. I work with thousands and thousands of companies. I know a lot of people, so I have conversations for four days in a row at GIE with tons of people I know that are doing really interesting things, running good businesses as well as a whole bunch of people that I don’t know that are in the industry.
Let me tell you what my takeaway is from the conference. Three things. Number one, our economy is booming. You know that. I don’t need to tell you that. If it’s not booming for you, you might be in the wrong market. There’s something going on, but if you’re not figuring it out right now, if you’re not winning right now, then there’s a systemic issue with your business. It could be business model. It could be pricing. It could be your ability to recruit team members, which every single person in every single industry is absolutely getting killed on right now. It’s not unique to our industry. It’s very hard in our industry, but everybody thinks it’s unique. It is not even slightly unique. It is killing everybody.
The economy’s booming. If you’re losing right now, you gotta figure out why. You have to work on it because it isn’t gonna get easier. If you are winning, or you’re losing, doesn’t matter, and by losing I mean you’re just not feeling the growth, you’re not seeing the improvement and profit inside your organization, there are three things in my mind you’ve gotta be doing whether you’re winning or not, because there’s a downturn coming. We’ve been in one of the longest growth cycles ever. We’re in a … We’re at the … reaching probably again a peak on the debt cycle, which means that things are going to have to downturn here at some point so that we can clean up some of the debt that’s on the balance sheets of tons of companies around the country and around the world, all kinds of things. It’s a bigger conversation. It’s coming. We just have no idea when. Next year, year after, nobody knows. Can’t predict it. All you can do is prepare.
The way you prepare is you know your financials. You look at your PNL. You look at your balance sheet. You’re getting accurate data into your accounting system, whatever that is, on a weekly and monthly basis. You are on top of that so that you can produce good financials. If you’re not doing that, and most entrepreneurs don’t love it, I have historically not loved it ’cause you just wanna go, go, go, sell, sell, sell, market, market, market, but you don’t really love paying attention to the numbers, you could spin your wheels for years here building this business that doesn’t generate much profit, then the economy downturns.
Your business takes a bit of hit. What’d you do for those last many years? What’d you build? You bought some equipment, paid it off maybe. Now it’s old equipment. It’s gonna have to be replaced. You didn’t take any money off the table. You didn’t really invest in infrastructure. You didn’t really grow a leadership team. What really was accomplished in those years if, yes you were growing, but there was no profit really being generated? This is something to worry about, so you gotta be on top of your financials. That’s the only way you know if you’re selling the right work at the right price. The core of all of that is job costing.
You have to know, by property, how much you’re making per man hour if you’re profitable on that job. If you don’t know, then companies like mine, which I got this right in the beginning even though I got a lot of my other financial stuff wrong in the beginning … companies like mine and companies like a bazillion other, let’s call it, Service Autopilot members and a whole lot of other non Service Autopilot members that are super savvy, that are job costing their work are going to eat your lunch in the downturn. They are going to take work from you. They are going to win the new work ’cause they’re gonna know exactly what they can bid that at to win it.
You gotta learn this stuff. I didn’t know it. Took me years to figure it all out. It’s not my favorite thing. I actually don’t love this part of the business. I don’t love the financial stuff, but it’s where the money’s at. It’s where the growth’s at. It’s where the security’s at. You gotta get your financials cleaned up. You gotta be on top of your job costing. If you use the right technology platform, technology solution, it’ll give you those numbers and you’ll be good. It’s not hard if you’re using the right technology to get those numbers. You’ve gotta clean up your non-billable stuff.
Where is all the waste? You’re driving too much. Spend too much time loading, unloading. You’re spending too much time fueling. You’re spending too much time buying drinks and snacks in the mornings. You’re buying … You’re spending too much time on breakdowns. You’re spending too much time on missteps in that plants and materials and things and parts weren’t on the truck and didn’t show up to the job site. All of that is killing you. Every dollar you take from non-billable time and you re-bill it is all profit to the bottom line, that very last number at the bottom of your PNL. Unbelievably important.
Number two, big thing I’m seeing right now that others are not talking about, massive consolidation in the industry. I have a unique perspective. There’s so much money in the markets, so much private equity money, so much venture money, so much everything. There’s so much angel money. There’s so much everything money right now. People don’t know where to put the money. What that is resulting in is you’re starting to see more and more acquisitions inside our industry. You’re starting to see more roll-ups. There’s a resurgence, in my opinion, in interest in our marketplace for companies like ours. You need to be one of the top players in your market if you wanna sell someday.
Right now you may be so small. “I’m just trying to make payroll. I’m just trying to survive. I don’t care about any of that stuff.” I get it, but have a mindset that, “Hey. I’m gonna build this thing. I’m gonna know my numbers. I’m gonna learn how to market. I’m gonna learn how to sell so that, at one point, whatever my little market is, my little service offering in my market is, I could be a real player in my market. I could … Maybe I won’t be a huge company, but I’ll be a leader in my market.” That’ll position you someday to have the best chance of selling your company if you even care about that. I’m not saying you should. In fact, I kinda don’t care about it, but I’m more careful about building a big business and having it be very profitable.
If someday, a byproduct of that was it was a very sellable asset, fantastic. That’s a win. My bigger point here is there’s massive consolidation in the industry. That means others with money that have a thesis on where the market’s going and the economy’s going and the world’s going, are very attractive … attracted to our business right now. I think that’s a very big positive for us. I think that’s a very good signal to us saying, “Hey. We’re playing the right game in the right market. Yes, we have a labor problem. Yes, we’re gonna have to figure out how to solve this. Yes, we’ve got some really challenging things ahead of us in the industry,” but when the big money continues to flow into our markets and you should look at which service, which types of companies they

Dynamics 365 launched in 2016 when Microsoft brought together Dynamics AX, its ERP application and the Dynamics CRM application. Microsoft was one of the first to make a move an offer an integrated solution. Given the dynamic nature of business and the likelihood of unique situations, it is becoming more and more important for software/solution providers to introduce applications that cater to the changing trends. Dynamics 365 is a comprehensive suite of services enabling all in one solutions so that you don’t have to pick and choose from the plethora of options available.
What is Dynamics 365?
Is Dynamics 365 an ERP or a CRM?
In essence, Microsoft Dynamics 365 is a combination of both Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software. It is a combination of elements from both system types as well as Power BI reporting functions. Here, Microsoft offers a product that allows the integrated management of both customers as well as the organisation. Although, you should keep in mind that Dynamics 365 is not one giant software. It is, in fact, a collection of apps that function as an integrated whole under the same name. Microsoft Dynamics 365 was initially two separate systems known as Dynamics AX (the ERP) and Dynamics CRM (the CRM) which were brought together in late 2016 and repackaged as one system.
Microsoft was, in fact, one of the first few business application vendors to combine the capabilities of ERPs and Dynamics 365 CRMs.
Dynamics 365 Follows a “Common Data Model”
Usually, it is the case with enterprise software that the foundation, that is the data handling techniques and the database format itself is specific and often unique to the software with which it will be used — thereby restricting the application’s compatibility with other external apps that you may prefer using.
Furthermore, customised databases are challenging to integrate and upgrade and therefore, Microsoft seems to be trying to take a different direction and move to standardised and consistent database schematics. The entire customer base can use any new solution that Microsoft deploys under the Dynamics 365 umbrella. The only difference being that users will browse applications through a new store known as Microsoft AppSource.
Therefore, the Common Data Model will allow integration with all Microsoft applications as well as any other applications using a standard API.
Is Dynamics 365 Cloud-based?
Microsoft Dynamics 365 is wholly committed to the cloud and the advantages it offers. Not only does operate on cloud-based architecture help with real-time tracking of changes in data, but it is also an excellent way to bring more control and standardisation to the system since all inputs and generated outputs will be stored in the same place.
Although if you do want to keep all your data on site, you can opt for Dynamics 365 Enterprise Edition which deploys infrastructure and computing power on site so you can feel more secure. Although this means that Dynamics 365 will be running on its independent cloud unique to your organisations, you do not loose connectivity over the internet.
What are the Uses for Microsoft Dynamics 365?
Microsoft Dynamics 365 can be used for:
- Bringing your business together as a cohesive unit by connecting people, processes, and data across many applications, including Microsoft Dynamics 365, Office 365, LinkedIn, and Azure.
- Making smarter decisions with built-in AI, analytics, and guided action suggestions.
- Adapting the application to your needs rather than changing your business methodology. You can integrate most applications with existing systems or even customise with Microsoft Power Platform.
- Modernise your approach by incorporating AI, mixed reality, social, and mobile capabilities for progressive business innovation.

Many of the school's parents have complained but Chao says the resolution process doesn't work.
"The head of the math department is aware, other teachers in the math department are aware, the vice-principal, the principal, all the way up to the superintendent - yet there has been no follow through in addressing what is going on," she said.

Our first dance was set to “The Violet Hour” by Sea Wolf (if you haven’t heard it, why the hell not???). We spent weeks beforehand meticulously learning our dance moves, and when the day finally arrived I was just happy not to have tripped her in front of everyone. Clearly, this is what love is.
We oftentimes have vastly different musical tastes (I usually can’t stand country for too long, no matter how much pop they infuse it with, and she just can’t seem to get on board with the whole “Babies love Nine Inch Nails!” argument), but Sea Wolf has been a shared love since we first got together. And yes, I’ll totally overlook the fact that it was introduced to us by one of the Twilight movies.
Either way, it seemed like the perfect song to cover for a special occasion.
There are many ways to go about saying “I love you” other than, y’know, the most obvious one. I’m not always great about expressing it as much as I should (though I say it plenty), but this time I wanted to say it with one of the most valuable possessions I have to give: time.
Ask anyone with kids and they’ll probably tell you that there’s no such thing as “free time” after babies. I can definitely understand that to a certain degree now. Most of my day

What actions did the WWS undertake in response to the ILCSC/ICFA invitation regarding detector concepts and R&D in 2004
------------correct----------------------
nhanced beam polarisation.
The ILCSC/ICFA invited the WWS in 2004 to consider how experimental detector concepts could be developed while encouraging sub-detector R&D and promoting machine-detector interface studies. Members of the WWS organising committee held a diversity of opinions on how to proceed in responding to this invitation, creating a healthy, innovative effort to organise the path forward. This roadmap discussion became an intense topic of conversation and debate within the broader WWS as issues of detector collaborations and detector down-selection were considered.
To consider the efforts and advise on future directions, in 2005 the focus of the WWS on the detector R&D efforts was intensified with the establishment of a second R&D panel to survey the worldwide activities through a series of review meetings complete with external review panels. The reports of these review panels provided useful expert input to the various regional funding agencies decisions on R&D support.
With the formation of the Global Design Effort (GDE) in 2005, the WWS entered a new era. A vigorous worldwide accelerator R&D effort on the ILC was initiated, and the detector community felt the pressure to keep up. The GDE was planning the Reference Design Report (RDR), and the WWS led preparation for a companion, the Detector Concept Report (DCR), as well as volume 2 of the RDR, Physics at the ILC. The WWS community successfully produced the Physics volume and the DCR as companions to the RDR in 2006. At the same time, a new structure for organising the detector effort in a more formal setting was envisioned for the ILC. During this time, despite the increased focus on the ILC, the WWS organising committee maintained an interest in the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) developments with ongoing representation of CERN on the WWS organising committee.
The WWS developed a roadmap for advancing the ILC detector effort in 2006 and 2007. The roadmap was presented to ILCSC and a discussion ensued on how to realise this plan. The concept of an ILC Research Director, advised by an International Detector Advisory Group, was invented. The ILCSC selected a search committee to recruit a Research Director. Sakue Yamada was selected, and during the period of his transition into the new role, he invited the WWS co-chairs (François Richard, Hitoshi Yamamoto, and myself) to join him as regional contacts in his ILC Research Directorate. Initially, in 2007, this was envisioned to be an interim arrangement for one year, as the co-chairs maintained separate responsibilities to the WWS. But, as the arrangement, approved by the ILCSC, has worked to Sakue’s satisfaction and as he has seen no reason to revise it, it has continued and remains as initially formed. When François Richard stepped down as European WWS co-chair last year to be replaced by Juan Fuster Verdu, Sakue invited Juan to also replace François as regional contact in his ILC Research Directorate.
Through these phases and transitions, the WWS has maintained a critical role, contributing to the strength and progress toward realisation of the linear collider through efforts such as those referred to above. It has in particular provided a unifying forum for our common goals with interest in all future linear collider options.
The WWS continues to play an important, complementary role to the ILC project-oriented work of the GDE and the ILC Research Directorate, and I foresee this to be true in the reformulated, future linear collider organisation

What were the main roles identified for the Worldwide Study (WWS) when it was established
------------correct----------------------
As we prepare for another linear collider workshop (the 13th LCWS in the 30-year series) and contemplate the ILC reorganisation and next steps following the Technical Design Report and the Detailed Baseline Design Report, I have recently found myself thinking back on the history of the Worldwide Study (WWS) and the valuable role it has played. The ILC Research Directorate assumed many of the principal roles that were carried out for so many years by the WWS and its organising committee. Does the WWS still have a place? If so, what is it?
The WWS was formally launched in 1998 at the International Conference on High Energy Physics in Vancouver, Canada. The first co-chairs were Charles Baltay (Yale), Sachio Komamiya (Tokyo) and David Miller (University College London), and a regionally balanced membership with five members each from Asia, Europe, and North America joined the co-chairs on the organising committee. At that time, the LCWS series of workshops had already met in Saariselka, Finland (1991), Hawaii, US (1993) and Morioka, Japan (1995); it became the responsibility of the WWS to organise the future meetings of this series. Studies were active in three regions of the world, and the WWS became the principal mechanism to coordinate these studies. The roles for the WWS were then identified to be:
- Maintaining contact between the studies in the three regions;
- Encouraging growth of a worldwide user community, ready to participate in a linear collider programme – wherever a machine is built;
- Representing that community to the International Committee for Future Accelerators (ICFA); and
- Acting as a programme committee for the LCWS series.
The WWS organising committee would lead this effort, with interest in any future linear collider. The high-energy physics laboratory directors encouraged this new organisation.
In order to advance the detector R&D for the linear collider, in 2001 the WWS created an R&D review panel to survey efforts (projects and collaborations), assess the goals and level of support, and to identify gaps. A panel of three from each region was established and a report was written in 2002. This report helped spur the efforts and generate support. The report also took note of the difficult situation with regard to test beam facilities worldwide, and motivated increased support for facilities to meet this need in the ensuing years.
In 2002, ICFA established the International Linear Collider Steering Committee (ILCSC). The ILCSC invited the WWS to serve as the physics and detector subcommittee of the ILCSC, charging it to begin assembling a high-level parameter list to guide the efforts of the accelerator scientists and engineers. In response to the ILCSC charge, the WWS enlisted a scope and parameters panel to prepare a document. It was delivered in 2003, and guided the early design of the linear collider. The document was updated in 2006 for the GDE and continues to define the physics requirements for the ILC.
At about this time the WWS also prepared what came to be known as the consensus document: “Understanding Matter, Energy, Space, and Time: The Case for the Linear Collider,” signed by 2724 scientists and engineers, many of whom were not directly involved. The signatories had been convinced of the importance of the linear collider. The document presented the scientific case for a 500-gigaelectronvolt electron-positron linear collider, upgradeable to higher energy, with options for future investigations using alternate beam particles and e

The NFL and the negotiations between the officials is a pathetic. There is no negotiation.
What the NFL is doing is very simple. They are flexing their muscles, proving to everyone that they hold the upper hand in all negotiations and business deals. It does not matter with whom; officials, TV sponsors, stadium vendors, or stadium leasers (hello St. Louis). The NFL can do whatever they want. Why? Steve Young put it best on the Monday Night Football post game show when explaining what is going on in the negotiations between the NFL and the officials. He stated, “The demand for the game is inelastic.”
What he means is there is almost nothing that can affect the demand for the NFL among the people that watch the games and buy the tickets. Regardless of who’s officiating.
Last year’s player lockout is about the only thing that has and will ever come close to the NFL backing down. The NFL stood to lose millions in revenue if they locked the players out for a whole season. Every NFL owner is a billionaire, and in their business they are guaranteed to make money whether their team goes 0-16 and nobody buys a single ticket or if they go 19-0 and win the Super Bowl. The T.V. revenue provides the NFL owners with a guaranteed profit. The only reason why the lockout was lifted on the players before the start of last season is because the NFL’s bottom line would have been affected. No games=no T.V. revenue.
The other facade the NFL throws at us is “player safety.” The new kickoff rule took into effect last year because the NFL wanted to give the world the perception that they gave a shit about concussions. Concussions do no

What crime did Theresa Riggi commit, and what was the outcome of her imprisonment
------------correct----------------------
A MOTHER who killed her three children after a bitter divorce battle has been found dead at Rampton high security hospital.
American Theresa Riggi, 49, who was serving 16 years in prison for the horrific crime, had only been moved recently from a facility in Scotland to the the institution in Nottinghamshire.
Riggi had stabbed Austin and Gianluca, both eight, and Cecilia, five - eight times at their second-floor Edinburgh flat.
She admitted culpable homicide on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
Riggi was held in Cornton Vale Prison, Stirling, before being transferred to secure psychiatric care.
It came more than two years after she was allegedly disfigured for life by a fellow inmate at Cornton Vale women's prison near Stirling.
Riggi was treated for her injuries in hospital after suffering a 40ft fall from the balcony of the townhouse in 2010, where twin boys Luca and Austin, eight, and daughter Cecilia, five, were found dead with suspected stab wounds.
It came several months after Riggi, 46, vanished with the children in July, after a break up with her husband Pasquale.
After she was jailed for 16 years in July 2011, Mr Riggi said: "The horrific manner in which my children died will leave an indelible mark on the rest of my life. As a father, my natural instincts were geared towards safeguarding my children from the dangers of this world.

consists of work, baby, wife (which usually consists of a few minutes to talk about our day), and sleep. Of course, in between all that I have to find time to shovel food into my piehole. So when I do have free time, it’s pretty amazing. Getting to go out and play photographer is unbelievably liberating, but even sitting down to read at the end of the day is simply beyond words. So my “me time” is something I’ve come to covet quite a bit (“My preeeeeecious…”). So what better way to say it? Well, I suppose there’s jewelry and all that, but that’s beside the point.
With our anniversary coming up, it was the perfect opportunity to work on this project, but with free time being much more scarce these days I had to get started pronto. Free time is one thing, but free time when I could work on a super-secret project? That’s something completely different. It took over a month to put together (with a whole lot of hustle towards the end), but thanks to lots and lots of baby naps, a children’s percussion set from Guitar Center, and mixing input from an extra pair of ears (thanks Parag!), it all came together quite well.
Happy anniversary, Red. This is me saying “I love you.”

What are some of the key benefits of using Microsoft Dynamics 365
------------correct----------------------
Dynamics 365 launched in 2016 when Microsoft brought together Dynamics AX, its ERP application and the Dynamics CRM application. Microsoft was one of the first to make a move an offer an integrated solution. Given the dynamic nature of business and the likelihood of unique situations, it is becoming more and more important for software/solution providers to introduce applications that cater to the changing trends. Dynamics 365 is a comprehensive suite of services enabling all in one solutions so that you don’t have to pick and choose from the plethora of options available.
What is Dynamics 365?
Is Dynamics 365 an ERP or a CRM?
In essence, Microsoft Dynamics 365 is a combination of both Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software. It is a combination of elements from both system types as well as Power BI reporting functions. Here, Microsoft offers a product that allows the integrated management of both customers as well as the organisation. Although, you should keep in mind that Dynamics 365 is not one giant software. It is, in fact, a collection of apps that function as an integrated whole under the same name. Microsoft Dynamics 365 was initially two separate systems known as Dynamics AX (the ERP) and Dynamics CRM (the CRM) which were brought together in late 2016 and repackaged as one system.
Microsoft was, in fact, one of the first few business application vendors to combine the capabilities of ERPs and Dynamics 365 CRMs.
Dynamics 365 Follows a “Common Data Model”
Usually, it is the case with enterprise software that the foundation, that is the data handling techniques and the database format itself is specific and often unique to the software with which it will be used — thereby restricting the application’s compatibility with other external apps that you may prefer using.
Furthermore, customised databases are challenging to integrate and upgrade and therefore, Microsoft seems to be trying to take a different direction and move to standardised and consistent database schematics. The entire customer base can use any new solution that Microsoft deploys under the Dynamics 365 umbrella. The only difference being that users will browse applications through a new store known as Microsoft AppSource.
Therefore, the Common Data Model will allow integration with all Microsoft applications as well as any other applications using a standard API.
Is Dynamics 365 Cloud-based?
Microsoft Dynamics 365 is wholly committed to the cloud and the advantages it offers. Not only does operate on cloud-based architecture help with real-time tracking of changes in data, but it is also an excellent way to bring more control and standardisation to the system since all inputs and generated outputs will be stored in the same place.
Although if you do want to keep all your data on site, you can opt for Dynamics 365 Enterprise Edition which deploys infrastructure and computing power on site so you can feel more secure. Although this means that Dynamics 365 will be running on its independent cloud unique to your organisations, you do not loose connectivity over the internet.
What are the Uses for Microsoft Dynamics 365?
Microsoft Dynamics 365 can be used for:
- Bringing your business together as a cohesive unit by connecting people, processes, and data across many applications, including Microsoft Dynamics 365, Office 365, LinkedIn, and Azure.
- Making smarter decisions with built-in AI, analytics, and guided action suggestions.
- Adapting the application to your needs rather than changing your business methodology. You can integrate most applications with existing systems or even customise with Microsoft Power Platform.
- Modernise your approach by incorporating AI, mixed reality, social, and mobile capabilities for progressive business innovation.

Brown was drafted second overall by the Miami Dolphins in the 2005 NFL Draft. Brown started at running back for the Dolphins for the first four weeks of the season while Ricky Williams served a suspension, and shared carries with him when he returned in week five. Brown became the feature back in 2006 due to Williams' full year suspension. Brown sat out three games due to a broken hand suffered on Thanksgiving Day in a game against the Detroit Lions, returning in week 16. He played in the first seven games of the 2007 season before suffering a knee injury which knocked him out for the remainder of the season. Williams started over Brown in the first two games of the 2008 season, but shared carries with him after week two. Brown had 916 yards and ten touchdowns in 2008, which led to his first Pro Bowl selection following the season. He was placed on injured reserve for the second straight season after suffering a foot injury in week nine of the 2009 season. Brown rushed for 734 yards and five touchdowns in 2010, as he started in all 16 games. He played for the Philadelphia Eagles in 2011 following a six-year career with the Dolphins.
Brown attended Cartersville High School in Georgia, where he was a three-year starter and rushed for 4,936 yards, 12 touchdowns.
Brown moved on to Auburn University, where he majored in communications and played for coach Tommy Tuberville's Auburn Tigers football team from 2000 to 2004. He teamed up with speed running back Carnell Williams to create a premier running threat of speed and power. He redshirted after playing in the first two games of the 2000 season as he only gained 10 yards on six carries. In 2001, he played in 10 games and ranked third on the team with 330 yards on 84 carries and two touchdowns while catching seven passes for 109 yards.
Brown enjoyed his best season in 2002 when he gained a career-high 1,008 yards on 175 carries (5.8 avg.) with 13 touchdowns while subbing for the injured Williams. He also had nine receptions for 166 yards (18.4 avg.) and a touchdown. However, in 2003, with Williams healthy and starting, Brown's statistics dropped as he carried the ball only 95 times for 446 yards (4.7 avg.), recorded five touchdowns, and had eight receptions for 80 yards.
In 2004, Brown shared duties with Williams and started seven games. Together with Jason Campbell, coach Tommy Tuberville called them the best backfield in the past 30 years as they led the team to a 13-0 record. He totaled 913 yards on 153 carries and scored eight times. He also displayed his receiving capabilities as he ranked second on the team with 34 catches for 313 yards and a touchdown.
Although he started only 21 of 47 games for Auburn he finished his career ranked seventh in school history with 2,707 yards rushing on 513 carries while ranking fifth with 28 rushing touchdowns. Brown also had 58 receptions for 668 yards and two touchdowns.
- 2000: 6 carries for 10 yards and no touchdowns.
- 2001: 84 carries for 330 yards (3.93) and 2 touchdowns. 7 catches for 109 yards.
- 2002: 175 carries for 1008 yards (5.76) and 13 touchdowns. 9 catches for 166 yards and 1 touchdown.
- 2003: 95 carries for 446 yards (4.69) and 5 touchdowns. 8 catches for 80 yards.
- 2004: 153 carries for 913 yards (5.97) and 8 touchdowns. 34 catches for 313 yards and 1 touchdown.
Brown entered the 2005 NFL Draft and was drafted with the 2nd overall pick of the 1st round by the Miami Dolphins. Fellow Auburn University HB Carnell Williams was also in the draft and was selected with the fifth pick in the first round by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Brown held out of training camp due to a contract dispute and as a result was not successful running the ball in the first two weeks of the season as he rushed for only 93 yards on 34 carries (2.7 avg.) and no touchdowns. However, he got on track in Week 3 as he rushed for 132 yards on 23 carries (5.7 avg.) and his first career touchdown. He followed this up with a successful Week 4 performance rushing for 97 yards on 17 carries (5.7 avg.). But during Week 5, he had to again share rushing duties with another premier running back, this time Ricky Williams who was returning from a four-game suspension. Brown ended up having only about forty more rushes than Williams during the 2005 season, and was well on pace for a 1,000 yard campaign if it wasn't for them sharing the football. Brown ended up with 207 rushes for 907 yards (4.4 avg.) and 4 touchdowns while having 32 receptions for 232 yards and a touchdown.
With Ricky Williams suspended for the entire season, Brown entered 2006 as the feature back for the Miami Dolphins. The offensive line and offense in general struggled for the Dolphins, making it difficult for Brown to consistently produce at a high level. He had a breakout game on October 15 loss to the New York Jets, rushing for 127 yards and a touchdown on 22

What concerns did Sue Elder express about the conditions of the animals at the shelter
------------correct----------------------
aid.
Sue Elder, another volunteer, also spoke of spending hours at the facility.
“I won’t call it a shelter. A shelter is a safe, warm, loving place,” said Elder, who admitted she loves dogs more than she does most people. “I get there at 10 a.m. and the animals are laying in their own feces and urine. The first thing (the employees) should be doing is getting those little, innocent animals out of their feces.”
Fontenot agreed the volunteers are playing a critical role at the shelter and thanked them for their efforts.
As for the workers, Fontenot urged the volunteers to understand the workload. The animal shelter collects stray dogs and cats from throughout the parish and its 12 municipalities. It is also home to abandoned horses, donkeys and other farm animals.
“The staff is often out on calls all day long and sometimes all night long,” Fontenot said.
Fontenot said he is currently working with the LSU veterinary school, which has agreed to visit the shelter and offer advice on how it can be improved.
“We have the goal to make it better. It got better the first day I became involved but we have room for improvement,” Fontenot said.
His assurances didn’t satisfy the volunteers or some members of the committee. The committee instead agreed to forward to the full council a call for the establishment of an investigative committee to review the shelter and its operations.
Councilman Jerry Red said that committee should be made up of two to three council members and three to five volunteers.
“I’d like them to come back in six months and give us an update,” Red said.
Fontenot said, as with all aspects of parish government, cost has to be a consideration.
“If we bring it up to a premier shelter as some of the volunteers are requesting, it will cost a lot of money,” Fontenot cautioned.

After an injury to starting running back Ryan Mathews in the preseason, Brown started the season opener against the Oakland Raiders on Monday Night Football. While he was ineffective on the ground, gaining just 5 yards on five carries, Brown became the third-down back for the Chargers. On January 5, 2014, Brown sealed a 27–10 win for the Chargers with a 58-yard touchdown run in the wild card playoff game against the Cincinnati Bengals.
Second Chargers stintEdit
On October 7, 2014, Brown was signed by the San Diego Chargers, following a concussion suffered by Chargers' running back Donald Brown on October 5. The team had already lost running back Danny Woodhead for the season due to an ankle injury suffered on September 21, 2014, in a game against the Buffalo Bills. The team was also without running back Ryan Mathews who suffered an MCL sprain on September 21 in a game against the Seattle Seahawks and was expected to be out 4–5 weeks. Ronnie Brown played in seven games for the Chargers in the 2014 season. On December 20, 2014 (Week 16), in a game at San Francisco, he played an important role in a 38–35 overtime victory instrumental in keeping San Diego's playoff hopes alive. In overtime, Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers handed off the ball to Brown on six straight plays, as the team moved 22 yards to set up Nick Novak's game-winning fieldgoal. The next week, in the regular-season finale, he didn't record a single carry, as the Chargers lost to the Kansas City Chiefs and didn't make the playoffs. At the end of the season, the San Diego Chargers organization didn't offer him a contract extension.

carries. Three weeks later he rushed for a career-high 157 yards against a stingy Chicago Bears defense, helping the Dolphins to an upset victory of the previously undefeated Bears. On a Thanksgiving Day game against the Detroit Lions, Brown suffered a broken left hand from a hit by a defender's helmet. While he missed the next three contests, Brown returned for the final two games of the season and posted back-to-back 100-yard rushing performances against the Indianapolis Colts and New York Jets. In 13 games played, Brown finished with 1,008 rushing yards, 276 receiving yards, five touchdowns and a solid 4.2 average.
During the team's minicamp in May 2007, Brown revealed that he is eight pounds over his listed playing weight of 232, and would like to cut his body fat from 12 percent to 8 or 9 percent. During week 7, Ronnie Brown injured his knee making a tackle during an interception return and was lost for the season. At the time of his injury he was leading the league in yards from scrimmage and was on pace for over 2,200 total yards on the season.
Before the 2008 regular season started, Tony Sparano, announced Ricky Williams would be the starting running back. During the first two games Brown carried the ball 17 times for a total of 48 yards and one touchdown. Before the New England Patriots game Ronnie Brown was made the starting running back and has been featured in the Dolphins' popular Wildcat formation, which borrows from former Auburn University OC Gus Malzahn's college spread offense. Since then, Brown rushed the ball 127 times for 557 yards and eight touchdowns. Brown also threw for a touchdown in week 3 against the Patriots.
Although he split carries with teammate Ricky Williams, Brown still had a solid 2008 season rushing for 916 yards on 214 carries, an average of 4.3 ypc.
For the 2009 NFL season, Brown played and started in nine of the sixteen games of the regular season. During these nine games Brown managed to carry the ball 148 times for a total of 648 yards averaging 4.4 yards per carry. Brown also managed to rush for eight touchdowns. Brown in addition to rushing the ball managed to complete 14 passes for a total of 98 yards. During the 11th week of the regular season; Brown suffered a right foot injury against Tampa Bay and was placed on injured reserve. Brown's injury caused him to miss the remainder of the season.
In 2010, Brown became a restricted free agent, but re-signed with the Dolphins.
On August 2, 2011, Brown signed a one-year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles worth $1 million. It is reported that there are incentives in the contract that could take the value over $1 million.
The Eagles traded Brown to the Detroit Lions in exchange for running back Jerome Harrison and a seventh-round draft pick in 2013 on October 18, 2011, but the trade was voided the next day after Harrison failed his physical with the Eagles.

------------answer-----------------------
As we prepare for another linear collider workshop (the 13th LCWS in the 30-year series) and contemplate the ILC reorganisation and next steps following the Technical Design Report and the Detailed Baseline Design Report, I have recently found myself thinking back on the history of the Worldwide Study (WWS) and the valuable role it has played. The ILC Research Directorate assumed many of the principal roles that were carried out for so many years by the WWS and its organising committee. Does the WWS still have a place? If so, what is it?
The WWS was formally launched in 1998 at the International Conference on High Energy Physics in Vancouver, Canada. The first co-chairs were Charles Baltay (Yale), Sachio Komamiya (Tokyo) and David Miller (University College London), and a regionally balanced membership with five members each from Asia, Europe, and North America joined the co-chairs on the organising committee. At that time, the LCWS series of workshops had already met in Saariselka, Finland (1991), Hawaii, US (1993) and Morioka, Japan (1995); it became the responsibility of the WWS to organise the future meetings of this series. Studies were active in three regions of the world, and the WWS became the principal mechanism to coordinate these studies. The roles for the WWS were then identified to be:
- Maintaining contact between the studies in the three regions;
- Encouraging growth of a worldwide user community, ready to participate in a linear collider programme – wherever a machine is built;
- Representing that community to the International Committee for Future Accelerators (ICFA); and
- Acting as a programme committee for the LCWS series.
The WWS organising committee would lead this effort, with interest in any future linear collider. The high-energy physics laboratory directors encouraged this new organisation.
In order to advance the detector R&D for the linear collider, in 2001 the WWS created an R&D review panel to survey efforts (projects and collaborations), assess the goals and level of support, and to identify gaps. A panel of three from each region was established and a report was written in 2002. This report helped spur the efforts and generate support. The report also took note of the difficult situation with regard to test beam facilities worldwide, and motivated increased support for facilities to meet this need in the ensuing years.
In 2002, ICFA established the International Linear Collider Steering Committee (ILCSC). The ILCSC invited the WWS to serve as the physics and detector subcommittee of the ILCSC, charging it to begin assembling a high-level parameter list to guide the efforts of the accelerator scientists and engineers. In response to the ILCSC charge, the WWS enlisted a scope and parameters panel to prepare a document. It was delivered in 2003, and guided the early design of the linear collider. The document was updated in 2006 for the GDE and continues to define the physics requirements for the ILC.
At about this time the WWS also prepared what came to be known as the consensus document: “Understanding Matter, Energy, Space, and Time: The Case for the Linear Collider,” signed by 2724 scientists and engineers, many of whom were not directly involved. The signatories had been convinced of the importance of the linear collider. The document presented the scientific case for a 500-gigaelectronvolt electron-positron linear collider, upgradeable to higher energy, with options for future investigations using alternate beam particles and e

Asserting that “patience and goodwill” will not solve the problems of the region, the Times said that “Israel cannot be wished away by the Arabs or by anyone else.” It suggested that even if the Arab-Israel conflict were ended all insecurity and instability in the Middle East would not be ended

What was the even name, discussed in the High Court in Glasgow, and the resulting consequences for both the perpetrator and the family of the victims
------------correct----------------------
rderous act that ended their lives so unfairly.
"There is no justification for this heinous crime, repeated three times, nor is there any sentence that can provide justice for the overwhelming loss of three lives and the subsequent painful grief and devastation caused to surviving family and friends."
Jailing her at the High Court in Glasgow, Lord Bracadale said: "The result of these acts is a devastating family tragedy. The father of the children, Pasquale Riggi, and the wider family have been left utterly bereft by the loss of the children.
"And you, who had a genuine but abnormal and possessive love of your children, have lost them and are brought to this sorry pass."
He said that while Riggi's responsibility had been diminished, she was still responsible for her actions.
"The effect of the diminished responsibility is to reduce these crimes from what would have been exceptionally wicked crimes of murder to what are still very serious crimes of culpable homicide," he said.
Pasquale Riggi outside the High Court in Edinburgh Pasquale Riggi said there was no justification for such a heinous crime
"The number and nature of the stab wounds to each child is indicative of a truly disturbing degree of violence which, in order to bring about the deaths of three children, must have been sustained over a significant period of time. It is difficult to envisage the physical commission of such acts."
He added they were "ghastly and grotesque acts".

What is the purpose of the new administrative position mentioned in the text
------------correct----------------------
ts affected by the change,” Delgado said.
O’Brien said that while this tightening may have resulted in dropping out of UWRF, it also pushes students to succeed and encourages them to work harder, so it was not necessarily a bad thing.
This new administrator would sit on Chancellor Dean Van Galen’s council and report directly to the chancellor about how to increase enrollment numbers and retain the students who do enroll to build the success of the University.
While the position’s boundaries are not firmly established, that is the basic idea, said Paul Shepherd, director of Student Life.
A search and screen committee will be put together after the position is defined and officially posted for candidates to apply.
Shepherd said that this will be a national search to find the best candidate.
For O’Brien, the fact that this position is being created shows her how big of a concern this is for the future of UWRF.
As a student, she said that the different programs on campus are possible because of the size of the student body and that the diversity seen at UWRF in the variety of organizations, membership opportunities and personalities are “important to the student experience.”
With the number of students decreasing, so does the opportunities that are available now, said O’Brien.
Like any other search and screen committee put together on campus to bring in new professors or administration, it is required to have a student on the board to represent student interest in the search of a candidate.
O’Brien said that a good candidate to represent the student body in this decision would be someone who is dedicated to attending meetings and open-minded to the different candidates that may come before them.
Students interested in the position should contact Student Senate

Today’s field service industry is growing at a rapid rate, however, the technician pool is on the decline, as baby boomers are retiring in greater numbers each year and replacements are hard to find. In fact, the pool of Millennial talent isn’t able to close the resource gap, and field service organizations today are finding themselves in a situation where they may have a shortage of skilled workers, yet their businesses number of service calls is increasing.
In fact, 70 percent of service organizations predict they will experience a field worker shortage in the next five to 10 years, while 35 percent of organizations are facing that crisis right now, and don’t have enough technicians to handle the work. So, field service organizations have two options to turn to in order to combat the growing problem in the United States. They can hire Millennials to solve the shortage, which is what many are doing in America, as in 2015, one in three workers were considered Millennials. Or they can purchase a field service management software that has the tools, modules and integrations that can make a field service team more productive, even if and when their technicians begin to retire.
The Millennial Strategy to Close the Resource Gap
Field service organizations aren’t hiring Millennials at a rate they need to in order to close the gap being created by the baby boomer generation retiring. Only 15 percent of service organizations have developed strategies more Millennial workers, who are looking for more out of their job than just a paycheck, they want advancement, a greater direction and more technology in their work. Forty-three percent of Millennial workers want to work for a company that offers a career path for their technicians, and not just one that is the dame daily grind like their fathers were willing to do.
But with Millennials, you also get a group who will embrace new technology better than the previous generation, including field service management software, Internet of Things (IoT), augmented reality and virtual reality. Considering they have grown up in an age where mobility is second nature, introducing a field service mobile app is going to be relatively easier with a group that is already experienced with mobile apps and devices.
When you consider that most Millennials are typically not trained in the industry they are working in, there is going to be many challenges long the way. Seventy percent of Millennial technicians did not study for that profession, so there is going to need to be more avenues for them to learn, such as digital access to customer histories to get a better understanding on what previous repairs have happened, and searchable knowledge-based software that is easy for them to find the answers they are looking for.
But with field service management software, the training opportunities are endless, and you can take the experience of the baby boomer generation and pass it

rderous act that ended their lives so unfairly.
"There is no justification for this heinous crime, repeated three times, nor is there any sentence that can provide justice for the overwhelming loss of three lives and the subsequent painful grief and devastation caused to surviving family and friends."
Jailing her at the High Court in Glasgow, Lord Bracadale said: "The result of these acts is a devastating family tragedy. The father of the children, Pasquale Riggi, and the wider family have been left utterly bereft by the loss of the children.
"And you, who had a genuine but abnormal and possessive love of your children, have lost them and are brought to this sorry pass."
He said that while Riggi's responsibility had been diminished, she was still responsible for her actions.
"The effect of the diminished responsibility is to reduce these crimes from what would have been exceptionally wicked crimes of murder to what are still very serious crimes of culpable homicide," he said.
Pasquale Riggi outside the High Court in Edinburgh Pasquale Riggi said there was no justification for such a heinous crime
"The number and nature of the stab wounds to each child is indicative of a truly disturbing degree of violence which, in order to bring about the deaths of three children, must have been sustained over a significant period of time. It is difficult to envisage the physical commission of such acts."
He added they were "ghastly and grotesque acts".

Editions of Dynamics 365
Dynamics 365 is sold in two main versions, the Business Edition for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs or SMBs), and the Enterprise Edition intended for medium to large-sized organisations.
Dynamics 365, Enterprise Edition
The Dynamics 365 Enterprise Edition includes Dynamics CRM applications (field service, sales, project service automation, and customer service) as well as Microsoft PowerApps. This also includes Microsoft’s top of the line ERP solution, Dynamics 365 for operations.
- Finance and Operations
- Formerly known as Microsoft Dynamics AX, the operations module contains all of the finance and operations functionality of Dynamics AX.
- The CRM component of Dynamics 365 offers all of the lead management and sales process functionality you need in sales (more specifically, the salesperson)
- Microsoft Dynamics
- No longer exists as a separate module. Dynamics 365, in partnership with Adobe, offers a more comprehensive and at the same time, integrated marketing tool.
- Customer Service
- Integrates CRM functionality, new functionality, existing Parature functionality, and more Microsoft partnerships.
- Project Service
- Allows for estimating and scheduling projects in Dynamics 365. Perfect for professional service organisations.
- Field Service
- This module leverages the mobility of the Microsoft cloud and delivers extra features required daily by field staff.
- The HCM module of Dynamics 365 does not come bundled with the software and can be purchased separately.
- The Retail (POS) module of Dynamics 365 does not come bundled with the software and can be purchased separately.
Dynamics 365, Business Edition
The Business Edition of Dynamics 365 is the evolution of project Madeira, the cloud-based ERP/CRM. Microsoft recommends Dynamics 365, Business Edition for companies with employees ranging from 100 to 250. It has three modules:
- Finance & Operations
- The finance module is based on Microsoft Dynamics NAV, albeit with certain functionalities removed such as the manufacturing module.
- The sales module of Dynamics 365, Business Edition is based on Dynamics CRM and optimised for SMB customers. That is to say the level of customers catered to by a small or medium business.
- The module will be a partnership with Adobe, much like the Enterprise edition.
Dynamics 365 Isn’t Replacing Other Microsoft Dynamics ERP or CRM Products
Although most of the new apps available in Dynamics 365 are based on previous Dynamics products, the latest apps are in no way a replacement for Dynamics AX, NAV, GP, SL, or CRM. All of which will remain available as is for those that wish to use them. Dynamics 365 is simply an alternative way to license and utilise business applications, albeit one with significant additional functions.
Why Should You Choose Dynamics 365?
By combining the CRM and ERP module of Dynamics 365 and ERP with Microsoft’s productivity applications, users get an integrated and intelligent perspective of data about customer records, transactions, behaviours and preferences. This includes information about orders, inventory and shipping. If that is not enough, Dynamics 365 has excellent features and additional analytical insight tools for decision-makers.
The most significant advantage of Dynamics 365 is the strong integration it allows with other Microsoft business applications. For businesses that rely heavily on Office 365, Outlook or Azure, Dynamics 365 offers more beneficial union with sister products than most other CRM systems (most rely a great deal on third-party plug-ins). Microsoft is also expanding its collection of third-party applications that integrate with Dynamics 365 through the AppSource store.
Microsoft Dynamics 365 Pricing
Dynamics 365 pricing, compared to its primary competitors, Salesforce, SAP and Oracle, is also a benefit. It comes with bundle and role-based licensing, which are two of the more commonly preferred pricing features.
- Customer Engagement Plan
- The engagement plan for customers offered by Microsoft Dynamics 365 helps build and support customer relationships for your organisation.
- $115 Per user/month
- Unified Operations Plan
- Get full use of apps that help connect and manage your business operations.
- $190 Per user/month
- Dynamics 365 Plan (Best value)
- The best value for money option. You get full use of all applications in one comprehensive, cost-efficient option.
- $210 Per user/month
- Applications and offers
- Start with what you need and then upgrade to plans as your business grows.
- MS Dynamics 365 Pricing will vary depending on the module that you select.
While CRM focuses on the customer, ERPs focus on the business itself and how it operates. Nonetheless, both types of systems allow for company-wide sharing of information. ERP enables organisations to plan for problems before they become persistent. Obstacles in business operations can hinder the analytical thought process and thereby stop companies from focusing on the data rather than operations. In this way, ERPs offer the best way to organise business central processes.
Therefore, MS Dynamics 365 is an exceptionally well thought out toolbox with all the right tools, and of just the right size. Just as the tools can make or break an artisan, management software can either spell disaster for or skyrocket a business depending on whether the tools themselves function correctly and whether it is an adequate fit for your business and this is where Dynamics 365 comes in. The software will be tailored to your needs in such a way that there is never any question of whether Dynamics 365 is the right fit for you.

------------question-----------------------
What concerns are raised about the NFL's approach to player safety and officiating quality
------------correct----------------------
t occur more often on kickoffs than, say, a receiver going over the middle, or linebackers and linemen clashing helmets in the trenches. The NFL would love to give the perception that they care about the players or the integrity of the game, but they don’t.
Now we have refs botching helmet to helmet contact and late hits on quarterbacks. I’m not going through every play these refs have missed, it’s been talked about to death, and it’s sad. Nobody can be sure that if the professional refs were calling these games those injuries could be prevented, but the men currently calling the games aren’t helping. But, none of this affects the bottom line on the owner’s balance sheet, so none of this matters to the league. They just want to give the perception they care about the players by changing kickoff rules and releasing studies about concussions.
This is not about increased salaries or larger pensions for officials. This is about the NFL proving that they can run one of the most successful businesses in the world with or without the help of whomever they decide.
I’m not even sure these amateur officiating crews deciding games will get the NFL to realize they need the professional officials back on the field. It simply doesn’t affect the owner’s bottom line. Until people stop showing up to games or turning their T.V.’s off on Sunday, nothing will change. Forget the integrity of the game. There is none. Whether the officials come back in Week 6 or next season, it doesn’t matter; we will still attend our Holy Grail stadiums and worship in front of our T.V.’s on Sundays. At least I will be. And the NFL knows exactly that

British retail giant Tesco's ambitious venture in the U.S. grocery market under the Fresh & Easy Neighborhood Market brand could soon end.
Tesco announced Wednesday that it is conducting a strategic review of its money-losing El Segundo-based chain that could result in sale of the unit.
The announcement comes five years after Tesco opened its first store in Los Angeles.
"It is now clear that Fresh & Easy will not deliver acceptable shareholder returns on an appropriate time frame in its current form," the company said in a statement.
Tesco has hired investment bank Greenhill to help review options. The British retailer said that in recent months it has received "a number of approaches" from potential suitors interested in buying all or part of Fresh & Easy or partnering with Tesco to develop the chain.
The company will update investors on its strategic review in April, when full-year financial results are reported.
Fresh & Easy has 200 stores in California, Nevada and Arizona. The chain employs about 5,000 people, with about 300 at its El Segundo headquarters. The company also operates a sprawling food preparation kitchen and central distribution center in Riverside County.
Fresh & Easy said it will continue operations despite the strategic review.
"Our focus remains on our people and our customers. It is business as usual in our stores and we look forward to bringing our neighbors the same delicious, wholesome and affordable food they have come to expect from Fresh & Easy," the chain said in a statement.
Tesco and its CEO, Philip Clarke, have been under fire from shareholders frustrated with Fresh & Easy's drag on the company's profits.
"Whilst the business has many positives, its journey to scale and acceptable returns will take too long relative to other opportunities," Clarke said in a statement. "I have therefore decided to conduct a strategic review of Fresh & Easy, with all options under consideration."
Tesco also announced that Fresh & Easy CEO Tim Mason was leaving Wednesday after 30 years with the company.
Fresh & Easy had hoped to set itself apart in the hyper-competitive American grocery market by offering a combination of convenience and fresh food. The stores are about 10,000 square feet - roughly the size of a Trader Joe's - with a few even smaller versions having opened recently.
The idea was for busy shoppers to pop in to pick up fresh produce and healthy prepackaged meals and then pay at one of the self-checkout terminals.
While the chain has made inroads with American shoppers, that progress has been far slower than Tesco had projected.
In Tesco's third quarter interim management statement released Wednesday, the company reported that Fresh & Easy's same-store sales rose a slight 1.8 percent year over year.
Depending on what happens to Fresh & Easy, the biggest economic impact would likely be a loss of jobs, said Kimberly Ritter-Martinez, an economist with

ment of land. Teams must first understand how the WAPC defines this process. Surveys are required when:
One: any demolition, erection, construction, alteration of or addition to any building or structure on the land;
Two: the carrying out on the land of any excavation or other works;
Three: in the case of a place to which a Conservation Order made under section 59 of the Heritage of Western Australia Act 1990 applies, any act or thing that;
(i) is likely to change the character of that place or the external appearance of any building; or
(ii) would constitute an irreversible alteration of the fabric of any building.
These forms of land development render contour surveyors in Perth necessary.
Are There any Timeline Restrictions on Topographic Surveys in Perth?
The WAPC accommodates construction schedules, affording a flexible timeline on detail survey submissions in Perth. Teams have up to four years to submit findings for projects exceeding five land lots and three years for other projects.
Should teams fail to provide their plans to the WAPC, the work of feature surveyors in Perth is then voided.
What Should Topographic Surveys Include?
The work of qualified contour surveyors in Perth - such as Xcel Surveying - should include assessments of:
- Pre-Existing Structures.
- Adjoining or Adjacent Structures.
- Retaining Walls.
- Services (including manholes and valves).
Through the all WAPC planning guidelines can be properly addressed.

------------answer-----------------------
there. One, where is that smart money going? Should give you some clues on how you build your business. What is your service offering? Number two, it should give you some confidence that, hey, those with the money that are … that spend a lot of due diligence thinking about the future and financials are making a bet on our industry that’s very positive. A different perspective is almost every interesting software company inside the space right now has been sold, especially now that Real Green has been sold. There are several others that have the newer offerings that have come on the market in the last four years. There are software companies that are … most of the new offerings are all catering to the really small companies.
The reason I’m telling you this story from a software perspective is almost everyone now has raised a tremendous amount of money in our market, let’s call it 10 million dollars. Or, they’ve sold. There are very few software companies left in the industry now that have not been sold to big private equity or venture companies. Service Autopilot’s one of the last. What this tells me, and I’ve talked to a ton of these guys, is the very smart money is also when they’re buying technology solutions, they’re making a big bet on you. They’re making a big bet on this industry. They think it’s a massive growth opportunity. They think it’s a space where it’s going to grow in the next 10 years. Again, good for all of us in the business. Very smart money saying, “Hey, these are good businesses to be in.” I’m giving you a lot of detail here. I hope this is of value.
Again, what’s that telling you? It’s telling you to keep going in this business. It’s gonna … It’s telling you to figure it out. It’s telling you to get on top of your financials. It’s telling you to figure out your recruiting. It’s telling you to figure out marketing because you’re in an industry that’s very attractive, that more money’s coming into. What these companies are doing is they’re either buying up our types of companies or now they’re buying tech companies trying to get to you. They’re … Because they believe there’s a huge growth opportunity. I’ll give you another little clue to think about in your business.
A couple years ago now, Verizon did a study. There’s only about 17% penetration in our market. What I’m … that means is only about 17% of companies in our industry had moved to sass or cloud-based software, which is what Service Autopilot is, which the big money’s coming in and saying 83% of the market is totally missing the boat here. 83% of the market is going to eventually make the move or they’re gonna get crushed by the competition. They’re making this massive bet that everybody using desktop software and just using QuickBooks and living in spreadsheets is going to move to a solution like Service Autopilot.
I like to look for clues. Where’s the money going? Whenever the money’s going in a certain direction, it gives you some ideas on what you should be thinking. That’s a clue that you should be thinking about getting your technology ducks in a row, being on the right solution that will grow with you from 100 grand to a million to two million to five, because moving technology is a pain in the butt. What’s the money telling you? What are the clues? The clues … The money is telling you that you’ve got to play a technology game even if you don’t like technology. You need somebody on your staff doing it. If you’re not, you’re going to get crushed, and especially in the next economic downturn. That’s my next … my second massive takeaway.
My third takeaway is … it’s the same takeaway I have every year. Everyone’s running around worrying about the wrong stuff at GIE. My … I know that my channel here would be vastly more popular I would talk more about equipment, and frankly, I need to do that. It would be vastly more popular if I talk about equipment. Why does GIE attract so many people? They wanna come to look at the equipment. I get it. It’s cool, but who really cares in the broad scheme of things? I … It just doesn’t matter at all. I love … I’m a car guy. I’m everything mechanical in terms of cars and things like that. I couldn’t care less about equipment because it’s a massive distraction. I’m not saying you don’t buy the right equipment. I’m not saying you don’t get the right terms on your equipment. I’m not saying you don’t utilize the equipment.
Absolutely, you need to know what the best equipment is. You wanna make the right buying decisions because for every … think of a piece of equipment as a robot. For every … A mower’s a robot, even though it’s maybe not a robot yet. A weed eater’s a robot. A spray tank is a robot. There’s this machine. They’re a robot. What’s happening is every minute that you use a better piece of equipment, it displaces a minute of labor a human being. It is critical that you get your equipment right because right now we can’t find enough team members. If you had a piece of equipment that cut labor by 20% and you have five people, you’d only … you’d need one less person to run your company. If … Hopefully, you followed me on that. Yes, equipment’s incredibly important. You think of taking a piece of equipment and displacing labor hours, so the better and more efficient your equipment becomes, the fewer people you need to grow. Unbelievable competitive advantage.
But what are most doing? They’re running around looking predominantly at equipment, really excited about equipment, and they’re thinking about equipment in their businesses. They’re overbuying equipment. What really matters at the end of the day? Technology, understanding your numbers, marketing, building your leadership team, recruiting 24/7. Never, never, never stop recruiting. That’s the stuff that matters way more than equipment. Where is your brain power going? Is your brain power going to equipment or is it going to recruiting?
Recruiting is the number one bottleneck in our industry. If you don’t solve recruiting, you don’t have a business. If you don’t solve recruiting, you don’t win. If you don’t solve recruiting, you don’t get bigger. You have to solve recruiting. Where is your brain power going? If it’s predominantly going to the next cool piece of equipment, the next cool truck, the next whatever, which I understand, then it’s going in the wrong direction. GIE is a massive representation of thousands upon thousands upon thousands of people predominantly interested in equipment. It’s great. Do that, but it should be a small piece of what you do and think about because of all the other stuff matters. Another piece of cool equipment, another piece of awesome equipment in your fleet is not going to grow the company. It might reduce some costs, but it will not get you to the next level. You’ve gotta be thinking about all those other things.
Those are the three big things that I see when I’m walking around talking to people at GIE. Economy’s booming. There’s a downturn coming. Are you ready? Get all your financial ducks in a row. There’s a massive consolidation in our industry. Big money’s coming into our industry. They’re buying up all the tech companies and they’re buying up all the providers. That’s a positive for you. Keep going in this industry. The money’s coming into it. There’s clearly a belief behind it. Get your business positioned so that someday, a decade from now or 15 years or someday, you could take your money off the table with a very nice sell if you wanted to sell the company. What are the clues of the big money? What are they investing in? That gives you an idea of what you should be building. Then the third one is getting your equipment stuff right. Pay attention to equipment. Build out a great portfolio of equipment so that you can displace as much labor as possible, meaning you need fewer labor hours. Do all that.
That’s great, but keep your mind focused on number one, recruiting, number two, marketing, number three, financials. They shouldn’t be in t

was the only thing to do if I wanted to live,” Doucet told the CBC. “We had no other means. Who else would protect us? There is only the police, the justice system. I went through that route. I begged and begged. They ignored my pleas.”
In the video, Ryan denied the abuse.
“Her decision to hire a hit man to have me murdered was for her own monetary gain. Nothing more, nothing less,” he said.
He said that during divorce proceedings, Doucet had undergone a psychological evaluation that limited her access to their daughter and led judges to grant him sole custody.
Problems with her family, not with him, led her to depression and other mental health issues, he said.
“I wanted nothing more than an amicable separation and divorce,” he said, saying he offered to split their assets and pay child support. “I cared about Nicole very much. It is so hard to be deceived by someone after you put your heart and soul into that person.”
At the end of the video, Ryan seems to speak directly to his ex-wife, telling her how he’s been hurt by the ordeal, but finishing on a conciliatory note, saying: “time will heal everything.”

down to the Millennials who won’t have the same experiences working in the field. Augmented reality and virtual reality will offer new ways for Millennials to learn, using technology they are already familiar with.
The Field Service Software Strategy to the Resource Gap
With the resource gap widening, there is another option field service organizations are exploring more and more to get the technicians they need to fulfill the work they have. Many are turning to field service software that can help them with the hiring and on-boarding of subcontractors in order to outsource their work to the market. In fact, 76 percent of field service organizations outsource a part of the work their organization does, that doesn’t just meet the growing demand, but also increases their coverage area, as they can move into new territory without having to hire full-time workers, while also being able to be flexible in their current offerings when demand fluctuates.
Subcontractors allow a field service organization to offer more services than they have been able to before, without having to hire on new technicians, and with a field service software, they can be managed the same as any full-time technician would. Work orders can still be sent to a mobile app, checklists can be completed, work orders signed and returned electronically, while integrations to accounting software will ensure that not only is the invoice created quickly, but so too is the payment voucher to have the subcontractor paid quickly.
Field service management software also comes with the tools needed to better schedule your technicians for more enhanced dispatching, and analytical tools make it easy to start to find where revenue leakage is happening in your business in order to make adjustments, even with a short staff.
Combine Millennials with Field Service Software
Combing millennials with field service software is a winning combination, as a field service management software can drastically change how your organization runs, removing many of the manual processes, with technology that is already being used by today’s Millennials on their own smart phones and tablets. It’s embracing the technology of today as well as embracing the people and technicians of today and using the tools they know how to use. Service can be taught, and with changes being made that has seen the industry go to a more customer service approach, hiring Millennials with great customer service skills will go a long way to retaining customers in the future.
And with the industry moving to more advanced technology, such as augmented reality, virtual reality and IoT, it’s going to need technicians who understand how that technology works. And baby boomers will have to training in the new technology, which gives the Millennial worker the upper hand in not needing as much training and truly embracing an approach that has a field service software at the heart of an organization

Brown was drafted second overall by the Miami Dolphins in the 2005 NFL Draft. Brown started at running back for the Dolphins for the first four weeks of the season while Ricky Williams served a suspension, and shared carries with him when he returned in week five. Brown became the feature back in 2006 due to Williams' full year suspension. Brown sat out three games due to a broken hand suffered on Thanksgiving Day in a game against the Detroit Lions, returning in week 16. He played in the first seven games of the 2007 season before suffering a knee injury which knocked him out for the remainder of the season. Williams started over Brown in the first two games of the 2008 season, but shared carries with him after week two. Brown had 916 yards and ten touchdowns in 2008, which led to his first Pro Bowl selection following the season. He was placed on injured reserve for the second straight season after suffering a foot injury in week nine of the 2009 season. Brown rushed for 734 yards and five touchdowns in 2010, as he started in all 16 games. He played for the Philadelphia Eagles in 2011 following a six-year career with the Dolphins.
Brown attended Cartersville High School in Georgia, where he was a three-year starter and rushed for 4,936 yards, 12 touchdowns.
Brown moved on to Auburn University, where he majored in communications and played for coach Tommy Tuberville's Auburn Tigers football team from 2000 to 2004. He teamed up with speed running back Carnell Williams to create a premier running threat of speed and power. He redshirted after playing in the first two games of the 2000 season as he only gained 10 yards on six carries. In 2001, he played in 10 games and ranked third on the team with 330 yards on 84 carries and two touchdowns while catching seven passes for 109 yards.
Brown enjoyed his best season in 2002 when he gained a career-high 1,008 yards on 175 carries (5.8 avg.) with 13 touchdowns while subbing for the injured Williams. He also had nine receptions for 166 yards (18.4 avg.) and a touchdown. However, in 2003, with Williams healthy and starting, Brown's statistics dropped as he carried the ball only 95 times for 446 yards (4.7 avg.), recorded five touchdowns, and had eight receptions for 80 yards.
In 2004, Brown shared duties with Williams and started seven games. Together with Jason Campbell, coach Tommy Tuberville called them the best backfield in the past 30 years as they led the team to a 13-0 record. He totaled 913 yards on 153 carries and scored eight times. He also displayed his receiving capabilities as he ranked second on the team with 34 catches for 313 yards and a touchdown.
Although he started only 21 of 47 games for Auburn he finished his career ranked seventh in school history with 2,707 yards rushing on 513 carries while ranking fifth with 28 rushing touchdowns. Brown also had 58 receptions for 668 yards and two touchdowns.
- 2000: 6 carries for 10 yards and no touchdowns.
- 2001: 84 carries for 330 yards (3.93) and 2 touchdowns. 7 catches for 109 yards.
- 2002: 175 carries for 1008 yards (5.76) and 13 touchdowns. 9 catches for 166 yards and 1 touchdown.
- 2003: 95 carries for 446 yards (4.69) and 5 touchdowns. 8 catches for 80 yards.
- 2004: 153 carries for 913 yards (5.97) and 8 touchdowns. 34 catches for 313 yards and 1 touchdown.
Brown entered the 2005 NFL Draft and was drafted with the 2nd overall pick of the 1st round by the Miami Dolphins. Fellow Auburn University HB Carnell Williams was also in the draft and was selected with the fifth pick in the first round by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Brown held out of training camp due to a contract dispute and as a result was not successful running the ball in the first two weeks of the season as he rushed for only 93 yards on 34 carries (2.7 avg.) and no touchdowns. However, he got on track in Week 3 as he rushed for 132 yards on 23 carries (5.7 avg.) and his first career touchdown. He followed this up with a successful Week 4 performance rushing for 97 yards on 17 carries (5.7 avg.). But during Week 5, he had to again share rushing duties with another premier running back, this time Ricky Williams who was returning from a four-game suspension. Brown ended up having only about forty more rushes than Williams during the 2005 season, and was well on pace for a 1,000 yard campaign if it wasn't for them sharing the football. Brown ended up with 207 rushes for 907 yards (4.4 avg.) and 4 touchdowns while having 32 receptions for 232 yards and a touchdown.
With Ricky Williams suspended for the entire season, Brown entered 2006 as the feature back for the Miami Dolphins. The offensive line and offense in general struggled for the Dolphins, making it difficult for Brown to consistently produce at a high level. He had a breakout game on October 15 loss to the New York Jets, rushing for 127 yards and a touchdown on 22

What steps has the St. Landry Parish Council taken or promised to take in response to complaints about the animal shelter
------------correct----------------------
Volunteers call for animal shelter reformation
The St. Landry Parish Council is expected to call for a formal investigation into the operations of the parish animal shelter following complaints by volunteers.
Volunteers with Friends Underwriting Rescues became involved with the shelter a few months ago to help promote adoptions of dogs and cats. But the volunteers quickly became concerned about conditions at the shelter, which they call inhumane.
Parish President Bill Fontenot has met with the group on several occasions since then and promised to make improvements.
A number of employees at the shelter have been dismissed, an exercise track for the animals has been added and parking lot improvements have been made. A new 40-by-60-foot kennel for large dogs is currently under construction.
But this week the volunteers came before the council’s Public Works Committee to argue more is needed.
From comments by committee members, conditions at the shelter are a function of when you visit.
Both Council members Dexter Brown and Fekisha Miller-Matthews spoke of separate surprise visits to the shelter, located beside the parish airport just north of Opelousas.
Both came in the afternoon and both said they were pleased with what they found.
“I visited Monday and basically I was happy with what I saw. It was very clean. It was clean enough the Pope could have had lunch there,” Brown said.
On the other hand, Councilman Alvin Stelly said he visited in the morning and didn’t like what he saw at all. “It was a disgrace,” Stelly said.
Jennie Casanova, the founder of FUR, argued the difference is her volunteers.
“We got involved to decrease the euthanasia rate. Instead we are spending hours cleaning the cages. As soon as the volunteers arrive, the staff walks away and doesn’t return,” Casanova s

The Eagles traded Brown to the Detroit Lions in exchange for running back Jerome Harrison and a seventh-round draft pick in 2013 on October 18, 2011, but the trade was voided the next day after Harrison failed his physical with the Eagles.
San Diego ChargersEdit
Brown signed a one-year contract with the San Diego Chargers on June 8, 2012. After an injury to starting running back Ryan Mathews in the preseason, Brown started the season opener against the Oakland Raiders on Monday Night Football. While he was ineffective on the ground, gaining just 5 yards on five carries, Brown became the third-down back for the Chargers. On January 5, 2014, Brown sealed a 27–10 win for the Chargers with a 58-yard touchdown run in the wild card playoff game against the Cincinnati Bengals.
Second Chargers stintEdit
On October 7, 2014, Brown was signed by the San Diego Chargers, following a concussion suffered by Chargers' running back Donald Brown on October 5. The team had already lost running back Danny Woodhead for the season due to an ankle injury suffered on September 21, 2014, in a game against the Buffalo Bills. The team was also without running back Ryan Mathews who suffered an MCL sprain on September 21 in a game against the Seattle Seahawks and was expected to be out 4–5 weeks. Ronnie Brown played in seven games for the Chargers in the 2014 season. On December 20, 2014 (Week 16), in a game at San Francisco, he played an important role in a 38–35 overtime victory instrumental in keeping San Diego's playoff hopes alive. In overtime, Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers handed off the ball to Brown on six straight plays, as the team moved 22 yards to set up Nick Novak's game-winning fieldgoal. The next week, in the regular-season finale, he didn't record a single carry, as the Chargers lost to the Kansas City Chiefs and didn't make the playoffs. At the end of the season, the San Diego Chargers organization didn't offer him a contract extension.

------------question-----------------------
What are the main considerations when choosing between GeneratePress and Astra themes for page builder integration and pricing
------------correct----------------------
in, scalable, and also easier to market.
But I think WP Astra has taken it too far by creating a separate addon for just a “Scroll to top” button.
These themes are indeed developed with non-coders in mind. But still, have some great features for developers to play with.
For CSS changes, both these themes come with custom CSS section (not to mention).
There is also a section for you to add hooks without touching the theme files. Thus, totally eliminating the need to create a separate child theme. You can add hooks to header, body or the footer.
There are also options for you to export/import the theme settings, and it is extremely helpful while creating your clients’ websites without having to go through all those settings.
If creating a child theme is what you are looking for, then both GeneratePress and Astra themes support the creation of child themes.
With this, as a developer, you’ll be getting the ultimate freedom to build something awesome upon the solid framework.
Compatibility with page builders
Both these themes work great with page builder plugins like Elementor, Beaver Builder and, Thrive Architect.
I’m using GeneratePress with Thrive Architect plugin. The journey has been so smooth so far. The integration between these two is rock-solid.
I can’t really comment about Thrive Architect with Astra Pro as I haven’t really used the combo.
If you are using Elementor, then both GeneratePress and Astra works great for you as per my observations. But still, Elementor has officially recommended GeneratePress on their articles. You can’t go wrong with any of these.
The Astra theme has a good integration with Beaver Builder. Even the WPAstra site is designed using Beaver Builder.
On the other hand, Beaver Builder also works great with GeneratePress.
If you are asking me about Visual Composer, I’ve never used this plugin mainly due to the extensive usage of shortcodes. But still based on the reviews I can say that both these themes work great with Visual Composer.
Astra is built originally to integrate smoothly with page builders or at least they market like that.
Also, the Brainstorm Force team has a good track record of building plugins for page builders like Ultimate Add-ons for Beaver Builder and Visual Composer. So, if you are specific about how the theme performs with page builders, go with Astra.
GeneratePress also integrates perfectly with all the page builders. In fact, it is the theme that I use on my site with Thrive Architect and also heard people recommending it strongly to use GeneratePress alongside Elementor.
Both these themes come with a dedicated modules/addons for Woocommerce integration. Please note that only when you have WooCommerce plugin activated on your WordPress site, you’ll see the module options in the customizer page.
With both the themes, you can select the layout, alignment, and also choose the number of products to display on a single page.
Added to these options, with Astra Pro you can also select the order in which the product information appears.
Support and documentation
Both GeneratePress and Astra Pro come with one year of free updates and support. Both these themes have a ticket system where you can raise tickets for support.
Apart from the ticket system, both these themes have a dedicated support forum and a knowledge base.
Both these themes have a good knowledge graph. With GeneratePress 2.0 coming onboard, the knowledge base of GeneratePress is really growing than ever.
Both GeneratePress and Astra are freemium themes. Their free versions won’t come with modules, support, and also many other features.
If you want the pro versions, GeneratePress costs $39.95 per year. WP Astra costs you $59/year. Both these come with usage on unlimited sites, updates, and support.
You also need to note that GeneratePress offers you 40% off on renewal, whereas WP Astra offers you only 20% off on renewal.
It is also worthwhile to note that WP Astra has a separate agency plan which sells for $249/year. It does include a bunch of extras like their addons for page builder plugins, and much more.
Whereas, GeneratePress gives you the right to use their theme on unlimited client sites with their one and the only premium plan itself. They don’t have a separate agency plan.
GeneratePress is by far the most affordable option for you.
Here’s my final take.
However, it doesn’t mean that GeneratePress has fewer features. It has great features more than you may ever use.
If you’ve seen the pricing section of this post, you can notice that the GeneratePress comes at half the price of Astra Pro for a user. If you own an agency, GeneratePress comes at a fraction of the price of Astra.
As documented in one of my previous blog posts, I shifted from FocusBlog to GeneratePress. Before making a switch, I was in a dilemma to choose between GeneratePress and Astra. I finally settled with GeneratePress due to its integration with page builders, popularity, and affordability. For me, the additional features Astra was offering didn’t make much difference.
Again, if you forget the price for a while, Astra has a little edge over GeneratePress.
You can’t really go wrong with either of these.
Are the additional features that Astra offers worth the price? You are the one to decide.
If you are willing to buy any of these themes, make sure you do it through one of the above links and buy me a coffee 🙂

in, scalable, and also easier to market.
But I think WP Astra has taken it too far by creating a separate addon for just a “Scroll to top” button.
These themes are indeed developed with non-coders in mind. But still, have some great features for developers to play with.
For CSS changes, both these themes come with custom CSS section (not to mention).
There is also a section for you to add hooks without touching the theme files. Thus, totally eliminating the need to create a separate child theme. You can add hooks to header, body or the footer.
There are also options for you to export/import the theme settings, and it is extremely helpful while creating your clients’ websites without having to go through all those settings.
If creating a child theme is what you are looking for, then both GeneratePress and Astra themes support the creation of child themes.
With this, as a developer, you’ll be getting the ultimate freedom to build something awesome upon the solid framework.
Compatibility with page builders
Both these themes work great with page builder plugins like Elementor, Beaver Builder and, Thrive Architect.
I’m using GeneratePress with Thrive Architect plugin. The journey has been so smooth so far. The integration between these two is rock-solid.
I can’t really comment about Thrive Architect with Astra Pro as I haven’t really used the combo.
If you are using Elementor, then both GeneratePress and Astra works great for you as per my observations. But still, Elementor has officially recommended GeneratePress on their articles. You can’t go wrong with any of these.
The Astra theme has a good integration with Beaver Builder. Even the WPAstra site is designed using Beaver Builder.
On the other hand, Beaver Builder also works great with GeneratePress.
If you are asking me about Visual Composer, I’ve never used this plugin mainly due to the extensive usage of shortcodes. But still based on the reviews I can say that both these themes work great with Visual Composer.
Astra is built originally to integrate smoothly with page builders or at least they market like that.
Also, the Brainstorm Force team has a good track record of building plugins for page builders like Ultimate Add-ons for Beaver Builder and Visual Composer. So, if you are specific about how the theme performs with page builders, go with Astra.
GeneratePress also integrates perfectly with all the page builders. In fact, it is the theme that I use on my site with Thrive Architect and also heard people recommending it strongly to use GeneratePress alongside Elementor.
Both these themes come with a dedicated modules/addons for Woocommerce integration. Please note that only when you have WooCommerce plugin activated on your WordPress site, you’ll see the module options in the customizer page.
With both the themes, you can select the layout, alignment, and also choose the number of products to display on a single page.
Added to these options, with Astra Pro you can also select the order in which the product information appears.
Support and documentation
Both GeneratePress and Astra Pro come with one year of free updates and support. Both these themes have a ticket system where you can raise tickets for support.
Apart from the ticket system, both these themes have a dedicated support forum and a knowledge base.
Both these themes have a good knowledge graph. With GeneratePress 2.0 coming onboard, the knowledge base of GeneratePress is really growing than ever.
Both GeneratePress and Astra are freemium themes. Their free versions won’t come with modules, support, and also many other features.
If you want the pro versions, GeneratePress costs $39.95 per year. WP Astra costs you $59/year. Both these come with usage on unlimited sites, updates, and support.
You also need to note that GeneratePress offers you 40% off on renewal, whereas WP Astra offers you only 20% off on renewal.
It is also worthwhile to note that WP Astra has a separate agency plan which sells for $249/year. It does include a bunch of extras like their addons for page builder plugins, and much more.
Whereas, GeneratePress gives you the right to use their theme on unlimited client sites with their one and the only premium plan itself. They don’t have a separate agency plan.
GeneratePress is by far the most affordable option for you.
Here’s my final take.
However, it doesn’t mean that GeneratePress has fewer features. It has great features more than you may ever use.
If you’ve seen the pricing section of this post, you can notice that the GeneratePress comes at half the price of Astra Pro for a user. If you own an agency, GeneratePress comes at a fraction of the price of Astra.
As documented in one of my previous blog posts, I shifted from FocusBlog to GeneratePress. Before making a switch, I was in a dilemma to choose between GeneratePress and Astra. I finally settled with GeneratePress due to its integration with page builders, popularity, and affordability. For me, the additional features Astra was offering didn’t make much difference.
Again, if you forget the price for a while, Astra has a little edge over GeneratePress.
You can’t really go wrong with either of these.
Are the additional features that Astra offers worth the price? You are the one to decide.
If you are willing to buy any of these themes, make sure you do it through one of the above links and buy me a coffee 🙂

What did Ryan claim was the motive behind Doucet hiring a hit man to have him murdered
------------correct----------------------
was the only thing to do if I wanted to live,” Doucet told the CBC. “We had no other means. Who else would protect us? There is only the police, the justice system. I went through that route. I begged and begged. They ignored my pleas.”

He said that during divorce proceedings, Doucet had undergone a psychological evaluation that limited her access to their daughter and led judges to grant him sole custody.
Problems with her family, not with him, led her to depression and other mental health issues, he said.

At the end of the video, Ryan seems to speak directly to his ex-wife, telling her how he’s been hurt by the ordeal, but finishing on a conciliatory note, saying: “time will heal everything.”

What challenges are field service organizations facing due to the retirement of baby boomers
------------correct----------------------
Today’s field service industry is growing at a rapid rate, however, the technician pool is on the decline, as baby boomers are retiring in greater numbers each year and replacements are hard to find. In fact, the pool of Millennial talent isn’t able to close the resource gap, and field service organizations today are finding themselves in a situation where they may have a shortage of skilled workers, yet their businesses number of service calls is increasing.
In fact, 70 percent of service organizations predict they will experience a field worker shortage in the next five to 10 years, while 35 percent of organizations are facing that crisis right now, and don’t have enough technicians to handle the work. So, field service organizations have two options to turn to in order to combat the growing problem in the United States. They can hire Millennials to solve the shortage, which is what many are doing in America, as in 2015, one in three workers were considered Millennials. Or they can purchase a field service management software that has the tools, modules and integrations that can make a field service team more productive, even if and when their technicians begin to retire.
The Millennial Strategy to Close the Resource Gap
Field service organizations aren’t hiring Millennials at a rate they need to in order to close the gap being created by the baby boomer generation retiring. Only 15 percent of service organizations have developed strategies more Millennial workers, who are looking for more out of their job than just a paycheck, they want advancement, a greater direction and more technology in their work. Forty-three percent of Millennial workers want to work for a company that offers a career path for their technicians, and not just one that is the dame daily grind like their fathers were willing to do.
But with Millennials, you also get a group who will embrace new technology better than the previous generation, including field service management software, Internet of Things (IoT), augmented reality and virtual reality. Considering they have grown up in an age where mobility is second nature, introducing a field service mobile app is going to be relatively easier with a group that is already experienced with mobile apps and devices.
When you consider that most Millennials are typically not trained in the industry they are working in, there is going to be many challenges long the way. Seventy percent of Millennial technicians did not study for that profession, so there is going to need to be more avenues for them to learn, such as digital access to customer histories to get a better understanding on what previous repairs have happened, and searchable knowledge-based software that is easy for them to find the answers they are looking for.
But with field service management software, the training opportunities are endless, and you can take the experience of the baby boomer generation and pass it

------------question-----------------------
What song did the author and their partner use for their first dance
------------correct----------------------
Our first dance was set to “The Violet Hour” by Sea Wolf (if you haven’t heard it, why the hell not???). We spent weeks beforehand meticulously learning our dance moves, and when the day finally arrived I was just happy not to have tripped her in front of everyone. Clearly, this is what love is.
We oftentimes have vastly different musical tastes (I usually can’t stand country for too long, no matter how much pop they infuse it with, and she just can’t seem to get on board with the whole “Babies love Nine Inch Nails!” argument), but Sea Wolf has been a shared love since we first got together. And yes, I’ll totally overlook the fact that it was introduced to us by one of the Twilight movies.
Either way, it seemed like the perfect song to cover for a special occasion.
There are many ways to go about saying “I love you” other than, y’know, the most obvious one. I’m not always great about expressing it as much as I should (though I say it plenty), but this time I wanted to say it with one of the most valuable possessions I have to give: time.
Ask anyone with kids and they’ll probably tell you that there’s no such thing as “free time” after babies. I can definitely understand that to a certain degree now. Most of my day

l be a deciding factor, too. But why would Zynga hold such an event all about one of its least popular games?
Since its release earlier this summer, Pioneer Trail has been in decline, according to AppData. That's despite some hefty updates pushed to the game like the massive Ghost Town. Our guess is that Zynga is looking for answers as to why what was once one of its most popular games has lost its luster after what was supposed to be its revival. Check out the forum post here for all the details.
Why do you think Zynga is holding such a Pioneer Trail conference? Do you plan on applying to get a seat? Sound off in the comments. Add Comment.

What was Michael Ryan's reaction to the Supreme Court's decision to free his ex-wife Nicole Ryan
------------correct----------------------
Husband criticizes Supreme Court decision to free ex-wife who hired hit man to kill him
In an online response to the Supreme Court decision to free Nicole Ryan, her ex-husband denies he was an abuser and says she tried to kill him for money.
Share via Email
The Nova Scotia man whose ex-wife tried to hire a hit man to kill him called the Supreme Court’s decision to set her free a “farce” and a “disgrace” in an online video.
Over the course of a nine-minute video posted Sunday, Michael Ryan switched between addressing the public and his ex-wife Nicole, who now uses her maiden name of Doucet, and the public at large. He denies he was an abusive husband and tells Doucet her actions have hurt him and their daughter.
“I strongly believe the Supreme Court of Canada has denied the truth,” he said. “The public is still deceived by Nicole Ryan’s false allegations that I was an abusive husband and my side of the story has still not been heard,” he said.
After having been acquitted twice in Nova Scotia for counselling to commit murder, Doucet’s case was stayed by the Supreme Court on Friday, freeing her and halting any further prosecution.
She was arrested in 2009 after she unknowingly hired an undercover RCMP officer to kill her ex-husband for $25,000.
Doucet argued in court that she acted under duress because of the abuse she endured for years from her husband.
In its decision, the Supreme Court emphasized that Doucet was the victim of a violent, abusive and controlling husband, and believed his threats that he would seriously hurt or kill her and their daughter.
“It was the wrong thing to do, yes. But it

In its decision, the Supreme Court emphasized that Doucet was the victim of a violent, abusive and controlling husband, and believed his threats that he would seriously hurt or kill her and their daughter.

------------question-----------------------
What features differentiate Astra and GeneratePress in terms of theme customization options
------------correct----------------------
GeneratePress and Astra are the most popular themes in the WordPress marketplace right now.
If you are using any of the popular page builder plugins, you should be using either one of the plugins.
You know what?
Even, I went through the same phase recently.
So, in this post I will be comparing GeneratePress and Astra theme especially with regard to using it with page builder plugins like Elementor, Beaver Builder, and others.
GeneratePress vs Astra - Which is the Best?
Ease of use
When it comes to ease of use, both these themes beat every other WordPress theme in the marketplace.
These are the themes that have made complete use of customizer feature that comes with WordPress. You can see almost all the features these themes have got to offer in one single page, neatly organized - Theme Customizer Page.
Both these themes have a modular approach, that means set of related features are grouped as a module, and you can enable or disable unwanted modules to ease out your learning curve.
As a non-coder, you don’t need to touch a single line of CSS code to make most of the visual changes to your site.
Everything you need is just accessible on one page with live preview.
I would give Astra a plus one, as the theme customization is a bit easy to use.
Both of these themes are very easy to use, the simplified settings and flexibility in these themes beats all the other WordPress themes.
Astra is actually very lightweight when compared to GeneratePress mainly due to the fact that they are easy with queries.
When you compare the page load speed of sites, Astra has a little edge over GeneratePress when used with an Elementor template.
However, when Astra and GeneratePress are tested without any page builder installed, both got similar scores in Pingdom.
It won’t make much of a difference, because based on the integration of themes with page builder and other plugins you use, the results for you may completely contradict with mine.
But, Astra has a little edge when it comes to performance. But that’s not a deal-breaker for me.
Both these tools have very great features for you to customize the layout of your site. Let’s look into them.
GeneratePress comes with some features to tweak the site header by enabling you to tweak the width, alignment, padding and toggling mobile header functionality.
The GeneratePress also comes with the ability to set page header. You can set headers for individual pages, you can make the page header transparent, add video background, image, content or use all these elements in one go.
On the other hand, Astra theme comes with add ons like header sections and page headers. Inside the customizer you get the option to edit the primary header, add a layout above header, below the header and also make header bar transparent.
The “Above header” feature is what I found appealing!
Unlike GeneratePress, Astra comes with a separate “post type” for creation and management of page headers. In that separate section, you can create site headers, page headers and also set the display rules.
Having a separate section for managing headers is much more powerful than setting page headers each time.
GeneratePress comes with options to set custom text, set padding, and also select the number of widget areas in the footer bar.
Whereas in case of Astra, you can choose among the available footer layouts, set custom texts for each of the available footer sections, and also select among the 7 footer widget layouts.
Both these themes have the same customization power when it comes to the footer.
Both these themes offer the same number of widget areas depending upon the site layout you’ve chosen.
With both these themes, you can make use of multiple widgets in the footer bar.
However, by making use of some plugins or coding, you can always register new widget areas. You can easily add hooks to both of these themes without editing any theme files.
Special: With Astra Agency Plan, you have a section called Astra sites that essentially is a directory of dozens of sites built with Astra and various other page builder plugins.
With the click of a button, you can literally import the entire site. This is a great feature.
In color customization, both these themes are almost a tie. In the customizer page, both of these themes have the exact same control for color selection.
There are plenty of color pickers for you to change the color of every aspect of your site from widget title color to footer link color. Every visual aspect can be modified without touching even a single line of CSS for non-coders.
I would still give GeneratePress an edge because it gives you the ability to tweak the colors of form elements, slider elements, and menu elements in precision.
If you have complex needs, you can always make use of the custom CSS section which both these themes offer.
Both these themes come with both free and pro versions. With both of the free versions, you’ll get no access to premium modules/add-ons.
The GeneratePress premium version gives you access to 15 modules.
On the other hand, Astra Pro gives you access to 16 add-ons out of which 2 are yet to come.
However, by looking at the sheer amount of modules these themes have got to offer, you can’t just decide the winner.
The module-based approach in WordPress themes is on buzz for good reasons. It’s like object vs function-oriented approach. They are easy to mainta

What are the key areas a business should focus on to succeed in the current industry landscape, as discussed in the text
------------correct----------------------
there. One, where is that smart money going? Should give you some clues on how you build your business. What is your service offering? Number two, it should give you some confidence that, hey, those with the money that are … that spend a lot of due diligence thinking about the future and financials are making a bet on our industry that’s very positive. A different perspective is almost every interesting software company inside the space right now has been sold, especially now that Real Green has been sold. There are several others that have the newer offerings that have come on the market in the last four years. There are software companies that are … most of the new offerings are all catering to the really small companies.
The reason I’m telling you this story from a software perspective is almost everyone now has raised a tremendous amount of money in our market, let’s call it 10 million dollars. Or, they’ve sold. There are very few software companies left in the industry now that have not been sold to big private equity or venture companies. Service Autopilot’s one of the last. What this tells me, and I’ve talked to a ton of these guys, is the very smart money is also when they’re buying technology solutions, they’re making a big bet on you. They’re making a big bet on this industry. They think it’s a massive growth opportunity. They think it’s a space where it’s going to grow in the next 10 years. Again, good for all of us in the business. Very smart money saying, “Hey, these are good businesses to be in.” I’m giving you a lot of detail here. I hope this is of value.
Again, what’s that telling you? It’s telling you to keep going in this business. It’s gonna … It’s telling you to figure it out. It’s telling you to get on top of your financials. It’s telling you to figure out your recruiting. It’s telling you to figure out marketing because you’re in an industry that’s very attractive, that more money’s coming into. What these companies are doing is they’re either buying up our types of companies or now they’re buying tech companies trying to get to you. They’re … Because they believe there’s a huge growth opportunity. I’ll give you another little clue to think about in your business.
A couple years ago now, Verizon did a study. There’s only about 17% penetration in our market. What I’m … that means is only about 17% of companies in our industry had moved to sass or cloud-based software, which is what Service Autopilot is, which the big money’s coming in and saying 83% of the market is totally missing the boat here. 83% of the market is going to eventually make the move or they’re gonna get crushed by the competition. They’re making this massive bet that everybody using desktop software and just using QuickBooks and living in spreadsheets is going to move to a solution like Service Autopilot.
I like to look for clues. Where’s the money going? Whenever the money’s going in a certain direction, it gives you some ideas on what you should be thinking. That’s a clue that you should be thinking about getting your technology ducks in a row, being on the right solution that will grow with you from 100 grand to a million to two million to five, because moving technology is a pain in the butt. What’s the money telling you? What are the clues? The clues … The money is telling you that you’ve got to play a technology game even if you don’t like technology. You need somebody on your staff doing it. If you’re not, you’re going to get crushed, and especially in the next economic downturn. That’s my next … my second massive takeaway.
My third takeaway is … it’s the same takeaway I have every year. Everyone’s running around worrying about the wrong stuff at GIE. My … I know that my channel here would be vastly more popular I would talk more about equipment, and frankly, I need to do that. It would be vastly more popular if I talk about equipment. Why does GIE attract so many people? They wanna come to look at the equipment. I get it. It’s cool, but who really cares in the broad scheme of things? I … It just doesn’t matter at all. I love … I’m a car guy. I’m everything mechanical in terms of cars and things like that. I couldn’t care less about equipment because it’s a massive distraction. I’m not saying you don’t buy the right equipment. I’m not saying you don’t get the right terms on your equipment. I’m not saying you don’t utilize the equipment.
Absolutely, you need to know what the best equipment is. You wanna make the right buying decisions because for every … think of a piece of equipment as a robot. For every … A mower’s a robot, even though it’s maybe not a robot yet. A weed eater’s a robot. A spray tank is a robot. There’s this machine. They’re a robot. What’s happening is every minute that you use a better piece of equipment, it displaces a minute of labor a human being. It is critical that you get your equipment right because right now we can’t find enough team members. If you had a piece of equipment that cut labor by 20% and you have five people, you’d only … you’d need one less person to run your company. If … Hopefully, you followed me on that. Yes, equipment’s incredibly important. You think of taking a piece of equipment and displacing labor hours, so the better and more efficient your equipment becomes, the fewer people you need to grow. Unbelievable competitive advantage.
But what are most doing? They’re running around looking predominantly at equipment, really excited about equipment, and they’re thinking about equipment in their businesses. They’re overbuying equipment. What really matters at the end of the day? Technology, understanding your numbers, marketing, building your leadership team, recruiting 24/7. Never, never, never stop recruiting. That’s the stuff that matters way more than equipment. Where is your brain power going? Is your brain power going to equipment or is it going to recruiting?
Recruiting is the number one bottleneck in our industry. If you don’t solve recruiting, you don’t have a business. If you don’t solve recruiting, you don’t win. If you don’t solve recruiting, you don’t get bigger. You have to solve recruiting. Where is your brain power going? If it’s predominantly going to the next cool piece of equipment, the next cool truck, the next whatever, which I understand, then it’s going in the wrong direction. GIE is a massive representation of thousands upon thousands upon thousands of people predominantly interested in equipment. It’s great. Do that, but it should be a small piece of what you do and think about because of all the other stuff matters. Another piece of cool equipment, another piece of awesome equipment in your fleet is not going to grow the company. It might reduce some costs, but it will not get you to the next level. You’ve gotta be thinking about all those other things.
Those are the three big things that I see when I’m walking around talking to people at GIE. Economy’s booming. There’s a downturn coming. Are you ready? Get all your financial ducks in a row. There’s a massive consolidation in our industry. Big money’s coming into our industry. They’re buying up all the tech companies and they’re buying up all the providers. That’s a positive for you. Keep going in this industry. The money’s coming into it. There’s clearly a belief behind it. Get your business positioned so that someday, a decade from now or 15 years or someday, you could take your money off the table with a very nice sell if you wanted to sell the company. What are the clues of the big money? What are they investing in? That gives you an idea of what you should be building. Then the third one is getting your equipment stuff right. Pay attention to equipment. Build out a great portfolio of equipment so that you can displace as much labor as possible, meaning you need fewer labor hours. Do all that.
That’s great, but keep your mind focused on number one, recruiting, number two, marketing, number three, financials. They shouldn’t be in t

Hey. What’s up? I hope you’re doing great. Hey, I’m gonna give you three takeaways from my time at GIE in October. If you don’t care about GIE, you weren’t there, don’t let me lose you here on this video because the three things I’m gonna say are what I believe to be really important and I don’t believe other people are talking about them. I’m gonna give you my unique perspective and my perspective comes from knowing hundreds and hundreds of companies in the industry that are doing anywhere from, let’s call it, 150,000 a year to way over 10 million a year. I know a lot of guys doing over 20 million a year. Let me give you that perspective because it serves higher up. I work with thousands and thousands of companies. I know a lot of people, so I have conversations for four days in a row at GIE with tons of people I know that are doing really interesting things, running good businesses as well as a whole bunch of people that I don’t know that are in the industry.
Let me tell you what my takeaway is from the conference. Three things. Number one, our economy is booming. You know that. I don’t need to tell you that. If it’s not booming for you, you might be in the wrong market. There’s something going on, but if you’re not figuring it out right now, if you’re not winning right now, then there’s a systemic issue with your business. It could be business model. It could be pricing. It could be your ability to recruit team members, which every single person in every single industry is absolutely getting killed on right now. It’s not unique to our industry. It’s very hard in our industry, but everybody thinks it’s unique. It is not even slightly unique. It is killing everybody.
The economy’s booming. If you’re losing right now, you gotta figure out why. You have to work on it because it isn’t gonna get easier. If you are winning, or you’re losing, doesn’t matter, and by losing I mean you’re just not feeling the growth, you’re not seeing the improvement and profit inside your organization, there are three things in my mind you’ve gotta be doing whether you’re winning or not, because there’s a downturn coming. We’ve been in one of the longest growth cycles ever. We’re in a … We’re at the … reaching probably again a peak on the debt cycle, which means that things are going to have to downturn here at some point so that we can clean up some of the debt that’s on the balance sheets of tons of companies around the country and around the world, all kinds of things. It’s a bigger conversation. It’s coming. We just have no idea when. Next year, year after, nobody knows. Can’t predict it. All you can do is prepare.
The way you prepare is you know your financials. You look at your PNL. You look at your balance sheet. You’re getting accurate data into your accounting system, whatever that is, on a weekly and monthly basis. You are on top of that so that you can produce good financials. If you’re not doing that, and most entrepreneurs don’t love it, I have historically not loved it ’cause you just wanna go, go, go, sell, sell, sell, market, market, market, but you don’t really love paying attention to the numbers, you could spin your wheels for years here building this business that doesn’t generate much profit, then the economy downturns.
Your business takes a bit of hit. What’d you do for those last many years? What’d you build? You bought some equipment, paid it off maybe. Now it’s old equipment. It’s gonna have to be replaced. You didn’t take any money off the table. You didn’t really invest in infrastructure. You didn’t really grow a leadership team. What really was accomplished in those years if, yes you were growing, but there was no profit really being generated? This is something to worry about, so you gotta be on top of your financials. That’s the only way you know if you’re selling the right work at the right price. The core of all of that is job costing.
You have to know, by property, how much you’re making per man hour if you’re profitable on that job. If you don’t know, then companies like mine, which I got this right in the beginning even though I got a lot of my other financial stuff wrong in the beginning … companies like mine and companies like a bazillion other, let’s call it, Service Autopilot members and a whole lot of other non Service Autopilot members that are super savvy, that are job costing their work are going to eat your lunch in the downturn. They are going to take work from you. They are going to win the new work ’cause they’re gonna know exactly what they can bid that at to win it.
You gotta learn this stuff. I didn’t know it. Took me years to figure it all out. It’s not my favorite thing. I actually don’t love this part of the business. I don’t love the financial stuff, but it’s where the money’s at. It’s where the growth’s at. It’s where the security’s at. You gotta get your financials cleaned up. You gotta be on top of your job costing. If you use the right technology platform, technology solution, it’ll give you those numbers and you’ll be good. It’s not hard if you’re using the right technology to get those numbers. You’ve gotta clean up your non-billable stuff.
Where is all the waste? You’re driving too much. Spend too much time loading, unloading. You’re spending too much time fueling. You’re spending too much time buying drinks and snacks in the mornings. You’re buying … You’re spending too much time on breakdowns. You’re spending too much time on missteps in that plants and materials and things and parts weren’t on the truck and didn’t show up to the job site. All of that is killing you. Every dollar you take from non-billable time and you re-bill it is all profit to the bottom line, that very last number at the bottom of your PNL. Unbelievably important.
Number two, big thing I’m seeing right now that others are not talking about, massive consolidation in the industry. I have a unique perspective. There’s so much money in the markets, so much private equity money, so much venture money, so much everything. There’s so much angel money. There’s so much everything money right now. People don’t know where to put the money. What that is resulting in is you’re starting to see more and more acquisitions inside our industry. You’re starting to see more roll-ups. There’s a resurgence, in my opinion, in interest in our marketplace for companies like ours. You need to be one of the top players in your market if you wanna sell someday.
Right now you may be so small. “I’m just trying to make payroll. I’m just trying to survive. I don’t care about any of that stuff.” I get it, but have a mindset that, “Hey. I’m gonna build this thing. I’m gonna know my numbers. I’m gonna learn how to market. I’m gonna learn how to sell so that, at one point, whatever my little market is, my little service offering in my market is, I could be a real player in my market. I could … Maybe I won’t be a huge company, but I’ll be a leader in my market.” That’ll position you someday to have the best chance of selling your company if you even care about that. I’m not saying you should. In fact, I kinda don’t care about it, but I’m more careful about building a big business and having it be very profitable.
If someday, a byproduct of that was it was a very sellable asset, fantastic. That’s a win. My bigger point here is there’s massive consolidation in the industry. That means others with money that have a thesis on where the market’s going and the economy’s going and the world’s going, are very attractive … attracted to our business right now. I think that’s a very big positive for us. I think that’s a very good signal to us saying, “Hey. We’re playing the right game in the right market. Yes, we have a labor problem. Yes, we’re gonna have to figure out how to solve this. Yes, we’ve got some really challenging things ahead of us in the industry,” but when the big money continues to flow into our markets and you should look at which service, which types of companies they

t occur more often on kickoffs than, say, a receiver going over the middle, or linebackers and linemen clashing helmets in the trenches. The NFL would love to give the perception that they care about the players or the integrity of the game, but they don’t.
Now we have refs botching helmet to helmet contact and late hits on quarterbacks. I’m not going through every play these refs have missed, it’s been talked about to death, and it’s sad. Nobody can be sure that if the professional refs were calling these games those injuries could be prevented, but the men currently calling the games aren’t helping. But, none of this affects the bottom line on the owner’s balance sheet, so none of this matters to the league. They just want to give the perception they care about the players by changing kickoff rules and releasing studies about concussions.
This is not about increased salaries or larger pensions for officials. This is about the NFL proving that they can run one of the most successful businesses in the world with or without the help of whomever they decide.
I’m not even sure these amateur officiating crews deciding games will get the NFL to realize they need the professional officials back on the field. It simply doesn’t affect the owner’s bottom line. Until people stop showing up to games or turning their T.V.’s off on Sunday, nothing will change. Forget the integrity of the game. There is none. Whether the officials come back in Week 6 or next season, it doesn’t matter; we will still attend our Holy Grail stadiums and worship in front of our T.V.’s on Sundays. At least I will be. And the NFL knows exactly that

GeneratePress and Astra are the most popular themes in the WordPress marketplace right now.
If you are using any of the popular page builder plugins, you should be using either one of the plugins.
You know what?
Even, I went through the same phase recently.
So, in this post I will be comparing GeneratePress and Astra theme especially with regard to using it with page builder plugins like Elementor, Beaver Builder, and others.
GeneratePress vs Astra - Which is the Best?
Ease of use
When it comes to ease of use, both these themes beat every other WordPress theme in the marketplace.
These are the themes that have made complete use of customizer feature that comes with WordPress. You can see almost all the features these themes have got to offer in one single page, neatly organized - Theme Customizer Page.
Both these themes have a modular approach, that means set of related features are grouped as a module, and you can enable or disable unwanted modules to ease out your learning curve.
As a non-coder, you don’t need to touch a single line of CSS code to make most of the visual changes to your site.
Everything you need is just accessible on one page with live preview.
I would give Astra a plus one, as the theme customization is a bit easy to use.
Both of these themes are very easy to use, the simplified settings and flexibility in these themes beats all the other WordPress themes.
Astra is actually very lightweight when compared to GeneratePress mainly due to the fact that they are easy with queries.
When you compare the page load speed of sites, Astra has a little edge over GeneratePress when used with an Elementor template.
However, when Astra and GeneratePress are tested without any page builder installed, both got similar scores in Pingdom.
It won’t make much of a difference, because based on the integration of themes with page builder and other plugins you use, the results for you may completely contradict with mine.
But, Astra has a little edge when it comes to performance. But that’s not a deal-breaker for me.
Both these tools have very great features for you to customize the layout of your site. Let’s look into them.
GeneratePress comes with some features to tweak the site header by enabling you to tweak the width, alignment, padding and toggling mobile header functionality.
The GeneratePress also comes with the ability to set page header. You can set headers for individual pages, you can make the page header transparent, add video background, image, content or use all these elements in one go.
On the other hand, Astra theme comes with add ons like header sections and page headers. Inside the customizer you get the option to edit the primary header, add a layout above header, below the header and also make header bar transparent.
The “Above header” feature is what I found appealing!
Unlike GeneratePress, Astra comes with a separate “post type” for creation and management of page headers. In that separate section, you can create site headers, page headers and also set the display rules.
Having a separate section for managing headers is much more powerful than setting page headers each time.
GeneratePress comes with options to set custom text, set padding, and also select the number of widget areas in the footer bar.
Whereas in case of Astra, you can choose among the available footer layouts, set custom texts for each of the available footer sections, and also select among the 7 footer widget layouts.
Both these themes have the same customization power when it comes to the footer.
Both these themes offer the same number of widget areas depending upon the site layout you’ve chosen.
With both these themes, you can make use of multiple widgets in the footer bar.
However, by making use of some plugins or coding, you can always register new widget areas. You can easily add hooks to both of these themes without editing any theme files.
Special: With Astra Agency Plan, you have a section called Astra sites that essentially is a directory of dozens of sites built with Astra and various other page builder plugins.
With the click of a button, you can literally import the entire site. This is a great feature.
In color customization, both these themes are almost a tie. In the customizer page, both of these themes have the exact same control for color selection.
There are plenty of color pickers for you to change the color of every aspect of your site from widget title color to footer link color. Every visual aspect can be modified without touching even a single line of CSS for non-coders.
I would still give GeneratePress an edge because it gives you the ability to tweak the colors of form elements, slider elements, and menu elements in precision.
If you have complex needs, you can always make use of the custom CSS section which both these themes offer.
Both these themes come with both free and pro versions. With both of the free versions, you’ll get no access to premium modules/add-ons.
The GeneratePress premium version gives you access to 15 modules.
On the other hand, Astra Pro gives you access to 16 add-ons out of which 2 are yet to come.
However, by looking at the sheer amount of modules these themes have got to offer, you can’t just decide the winner.
The module-based approach in WordPress themes is on buzz for good reasons. It’s like object vs function-oriented approach. They are easy to mainta

nhanced beam polarisation.
The ILCSC/ICFA invited the WWS in 2004 to consider how experimental detector concepts could be developed while encouraging sub-detector R&D and promoting machine-detector interface studies. Members of the WWS organising committee held a diversity of opinions on how to proceed in responding to this invitation, creating a healthy, innovative effort to organise the path forward. This roadmap discussion became an intense topic of conversation and debate within the broader WWS as issues of detector collaborations and detector down-selection were considered.
To consider the efforts and advise on future directions, in 2005 the focus of the WWS on the detector R&D efforts was intensified with the establishment of a second R&D panel to survey the worldwide activities through a series of review meetings complete with external review panels. The reports of these review panels provided useful expert input to the various regional funding agencies decisions on R&D support.
With the formation of the Global Design Effort (GDE) in 2005, the WWS entered a new era. A vigorous worldwide accelerator R&D effort on the ILC was initiated, and the detector community felt the pressure to keep up. The GDE was planning the Reference Design Report (RDR), and the WWS led preparation for a companion, the Detector Concept Report (DCR), as well as volume 2 of the RDR, Physics at the ILC. The WWS community successfully produced the Physics volume and the DCR as companions to the RDR in 2006. At the same time, a new structure for organising the detector effort in a more formal setting was envisioned for the ILC. During this time, despite the increased focus on the ILC, the WWS organising committee maintained an interest in the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) developments with ongoing representation of CERN on the WWS organising committee.
The WWS developed a roadmap for advancing the ILC detector effort in 2006 and 2007. The roadmap was presented to ILCSC and a discussion ensued on how to realise this plan. The concept of an ILC Research Director, advised by an International Detector Advisory Group, was invented. The ILCSC selected a search committee to recruit a Research Director. Sakue Yamada was selected, and during the period of his transition into the new role, he invited the WWS co-chairs (François Richard, Hitoshi Yamamoto, and myself) to join him as regional contacts in his ILC Research Directorate. Initially, in 2007, this was envisioned to be an interim arrangement for one year, as the co-chairs maintained separate responsibilities to the WWS. But, as the arrangement, approved by the ILCSC, has worked to Sakue’s satisfaction and as he has seen no reason to revise it, it has continued and remains as initially formed. When François Richard stepped down as European WWS co-chair last year to be replaced by Juan Fuster Verdu, Sakue invited Juan to also replace François as regional contact in his ILC Research Directorate.
Through these phases and transitions, the WWS has maintained a critical role, contributing to the strength and progress toward realisation of the linear collider through efforts such as those referred to above. It has in particular provided a unifying forum for our common goals with interest in all future linear collider options.
The WWS continues to play an important, complementary role to the ILC project-oriented work of the GDE and the ILC Research Directorate, and I foresee this to be true in the reformulated, future linear collider organisation
