The collective was formed when she found a collaborator in musical director and producer Mahlon Rhamie, who had been disappointed by the quality of agency-sourced session musicians. ‘He decided that the only option was to find someone who could set up a pool of musicians with him,’ said Dance.
The collective launched with 15 players, including both women and men. They are all classically trained but have a ?variety of backgrounds in jazz, gospel, big band and world music. There is also a diversity in ages, from mid-20s to early 40s, which Dance views as important in challenging the upper age caps that, she has observed, often accompany the looks requirement in session jobs.
She said that the interest shown in the group so far by producers has been encouraging: ‘The projects we’ve been offered show that there is a desire for something new, as well as a place for the more traditional all-girl group.’

ntrollers, network devices like switches, routers, firewalls, and other critical infrastructure devices, this is a complex subject and there is a whole industry running on it which produces different products like SIEM ( Security information and event management) like IBM Qradar, Splunk, ArcSight, and various others, Endpoint security products like carbon black, sentinel, McAfee, Symantec, and various others…
often these tools correlate the collected data and generate security intelligence for the soc ( security operations center), which processes and eliminates further the noise and produces the final output, this output can lead to detecting an attack and then the security team takes action with the help of infrastructure teams.
Let’s dive into one example scenario, for example, you are monitoring the Network firewall logs collected into a SIEM or another tool, and now your job is to detect attacks happening from external to internal, what kind of attacks you can detect? here below the list
Port scanning: means somebody from external trying to see what ports are open on your network which are available to connect from external sources.
Access control enumeration
IP spoofing attacks
DOS and DDOS attacks.

She or he can then work with you to enhance those muscles and also to recover the proper position.Severe Pain In Hip Thigh And Knee

Severe Pain In Hip Thigh And Knee
There are several stretches that will help relieve this issue. One of the most typical go for the hips is the cat stretch. It is called this since it goes from the hip to the ball of the foot. An additional stretch involves lying on your back with your knees up as well as a fist resting under the buttocks. With your feet hip size apart, gently draw your curved knees towards the breast and also pull your toes upwards towards the head. You need to feel a stretch in the hamstring muscular tissues that add the hip shaft as well as down the back of the legs.
One more stretch entails resting on your back with your buttocks extended. While your legs are straight, draw the inside of your knees toward your chest. You will feel the stretch in the hamstring muscle mass that run up and also down the back of your legs. Repeat on the other side. If you can not get to over and touch your toes, you can utilize a tiny block to support them. If you can not pull your butt to the ground, you might want to have a person delicately use pressure or take a break.
One last stretch entails reclining number 4 stretch. This stretch is less complicated than the cat stretch. To carry out the reclined number 4 stretch, very first pull your knees right to the floor with the rounds of your feet. Next off, flex your knees so your feet are resting on the floor. Currently, cross your legs over one another and area one foot in the front of the other with the heel touching the floor.

I’ve resisted importing this newly discovered essential oil for two or three years now, for philosophical reasons. However many of our clients have asked for it, so we finally bought some in. (We’d bought a tiny amount to use as samples in The Energetic Oils Kit, but not enough to offer at retail.)
Fragonia™ is a fascinating oil. The ONLY trademarked essential oil that I have ever encountered. Evidently there are several varying chemotypes of Agonis fragrans, and only one has the unique balance of this oil. The producer raised a plantation of the specific chemotype, and trademarked the product name. There may or may not be some advantages to the consumer in this; I’m not sure.
However, the oil does appear to have some interesting and beneficial qualities.
The producer says: “Dr. Daniel Penoel has been working to determine the clinical application of this oil. Preliminary work indicates that it has significant anti-microbial activity. It is an extremely balanced oil, with the oxides (cineol…which gives eucalyptus oil its distinctive aroma), monoterpines (alpha pinene), and monoterpenols (linalol, etc.) in a near perfect 1:1:1 ratio.”
Tony Burfield describes the aroma as “a pleasant fresh cineolic odour with a hint of a citrus note (which becomes more pronounced after a few minutes) mixed with a slight spicy cinnamon tonality and sweet balsamic undertones. The dry down is very faint being sweet, soapy and woody balsamic.” I would never call it a favorite, to my nose it still smells quite medicinal, but much pleasanter than, for example, Tea Tree or Niaouli.
I have read that it should be an ideal replacement for Tea Tree, that it is gentle and safe enough for children, and more appealing in aroma. I’ve seen case studies where the use of Fragonia Oil has had amazing results with people suffering from intractable respiratory infections. There are case studies of its being used very effectively i

------------question-----------------------
Who inherited the land and miscellaneous items from James Renfrow according to the deed
------------correct----------------------
this because her second husband, James Renfrow Senior, deed land and miscellaneous items to her children from her marriage to James Gilbert. Their names were James, Christiany and Patsey. This was in Cumberland County, North Carolina and you can pull up all of the old deeds there to view them for yourself on their website. The transcribed copy of the deed is below.
Deed Book 28, Page 678
James Renfro to Patsey, Christiany and James Gilbert
This indenture, made and concluded this first day of July Anno Domini Eighteen hundred and fifteen between James Renfrow for and of the state of North Carolina and Cumberland of the First part, and Patsey Gilbert, Christianny Gilbert and James Gilbert daughters and son of Ede Gilbert of the other part. witnesseth, that I the said James Renfro doth give, grant, alienate, enfeoff, release and confirm unto Patsey Gilbert Christiany Gilbert and James Gilbert daughters and son of the said Ede Gilbert a certain tract or parcel of land situated lying and being in our County of Cumberland and state aforesaid on the North side of Black River containing by estimation two hundred and fifty acres bothe same more or less bonded followeth towit beginning in Atkins line on a stake thence south on said Atkins line to his corner a stake, thence West to a stake, thence South to their old line to a stake. thence East on the said line to a White Oak on Shuffolds Branch thence down said branch to the river, thence up the various course of the said river until it excesses the old line to a stake, thence as that line West to Red Oak then Northward to the mouth of the Spring Branch, thence up the said branch to the back line on a stake, thence East on that line to the beginning Also I do give grant alienate enfeoff release and confirm unto the said Patsy Gilbert Christianny Gilbert and James Gilbert daughters and son of Ede Gilbert three cows and calves one bed and furniture one pot and skillet and some pewter and sundry other household stuff all of which I the said James Renfro do by these presents agree to warrant and forever defend the said land and other property herein mentioned unto them the said Patsey Gilbert Christianny Gilbert and James Gilbert daughters and son of the said Ede Gilbert their heirs and assigns forever against any person or persons having any lawful claim to the same with this exception that I the said James Renfro am not debared from making any reasonable use of the said property for my support and the said Ede Gilbert is to be supported with the said property enduring her natural life or so long as she the said Ede Gilbert doth continue single but if she marrieth then the said property to belong to the said children towit Patsey Gilbert Christianny Gilbert and James Gilbert daughters and son of the said Ede Gilbert In Witness Herewith I the said James Renfro doth hereinunto set my hand and seal this 3rd day of July 1815.
I already checked the original to make sure Patsey wasn’t Peggy. It’s not. It’s clearly Patsey. I have researched the three Gilbert children, but I cannot find out anything else about them.
On June 9, 1814, Edith married James Renfrow in Cumberland County, North Carolina. We can assume Peggy wasn’t from this union because she was born in 1801. James and Edith did have two children: the above mentioned James Renfrow and Rebecca Renfrow who married James Wright (also in Lincoln County, Tennessee).
In 1830, Edith is living in White County, Tennessee under the name Edith Swindle. That was at least her third marriage, and that is the name she kept the rest of her life. We don’t know her maiden name.
We can assume Peggy was close to Edith and her son James Renfrow from the pension application, church records, and Edith being buried beside Peggy. However, Peggy and James would be half-siblings at most. It doesn’t seem likely that Peggy was Edith’s daughter from her first marriage to James Gilbert because she was not listed in the deed. There are a few options left:
- Peggy was Edith and James Gilbert’s daughter. Her younger half-siblings were James and Rebecca Renfrow.
- Peggy was James Gilbert’s sister, making Edith her sister-in-law. James Gilbert’s brother, Jesse Gilbert, married Elizabeth Pylant who was Pinkney’s sister.
- Peggy was James Renfrow’s daughter from his first marriage, making Edith her step mother, and James and Rebecca Renfrow her half-siblings.
None of these explanations completely make sense to me when we take the available records into consideration. To add to the confusion, I found another interesting record.
During her senior years, Peggy was living with her son, Felix Pylant. Felix didn’t pass away until 1922. His mother’s name is listed as “Margrett Renfrow”. Surely a child would know their mother’s maiden name, right? Not always. I’ve seen it mixed up or wrong before. Did the informant get it wrong? Is it possible, since James Renfrow didn’t die until 1901, that they just knew that James was Peggy’s brother and assumed she was a Renfrow too?
Confusing, isn’t it?
I would love to be able to find out whom Peggy’s parents are! I’ll keep searching.

What is the name of the drug-resistant germ that is spreading and has become resistant to most antibiotics
------------correct----------------------
A new type of drug-resistant germ is spreading across the country, raising eyebrows at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, Ga., and at hospitals across the country.
The bacteria simply known as CRE (or carbapenemase resistant Enterobacteriaceae) has become resistant to most antibiotics, with the CDC citing one study where up to 50 percent of cases of patients with the bacteria become fatal.
Locally, Piedmont Medical Center in Rock Hill reports five cases patients infected of the bacteria since 2011.
Statistics from other area hospitals were not immediately available Thursday night.

ate company based in London, was seeking closer ties to the NHS in September.
In January, it was announced that Babylon would be developing a NHS 111 triage app in partnership with North Central London CCGs.
Patients Know Best, a personal patient-controlled health record app, is already widely used in the NHS, although often with specific cohorts of patients.
Lloyd Humphreys, the company’s vice president of business development, said it had yet to be confirmed that company would be part of app library.
“But PKB is delighted to be involved in any NHS Digital or NHS England programme, including the app library.”
The eRedbook, an electronic version of the “red book” given to UK parent to record their child’s health, has been in development for two years and will be rolled out across London from April. It is the only digital children health record to be endorsed by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, having passed clinical assurance and standards.
Daniel Moulin, eRedbook director, said he had done some workshops with NHS Digital about “dovetailing into its work stream” but the app had also not yet been formally approved.
The apps form part of broader push from NHS Digital and NHS England to get more people managing and engaging with their health online, as outlined in the Personalised Health and Care 2020 framework.
However, digital patient-facing services have been promised before, only to be quietly dropped. NHS Choices was once touted to include many of features now promised for NHS.uk, such as a personal health record.
An NHS app library, now rebranded digital tool library to cover wearables, has also previously been attempted.
That store closed in October 2015, after a study found many of the apps did not adequately protect patient data.
NHS digital leaders will be hoping a more rigorous “four-stage endorsement” model will help improve the quality and security of apps this time round.

To All International Officers, U.S. Rail General Committees and State Legislative Boards
Dear Sirs and Brothers:
The purpose of this letter is to bring you up to date on the current status of National Negotiations.
As you will determine by reviewing the attached material, the NCCC and the railroad industry are attempting to destroy rail labor. Let me repeat that, the NCCC and the railroad industry are attempting to destroy all of rail labor.
Through out this entire round of negotiations, the NCCC has attempted to pit the two operating organizations against each other with lies and despicable tactics. Their plan has not worked. As you can witness from the enclosed material, the NCCC wants to give all the road work to the BLET and all the yard work to the UTU thereby reducing the jobs of both the UTU and BLET downward. Since UTU and BLET would not give consideration to assisting the Carriers in doing each other in, the last and what we were told is the NCCC's final proposal is to freeze all wages through 2009. New hires would never get above 80% of the full rate in effect on June 30, 2005.
It is not just the UTU and BLET that the Carriers are attempting to destroy, but the non-operating unions as well. They are insisting on the full right to contract out non-operating union's work. They have shown complete disregard for the safety of their employees as well as the public. They want to hire unqualified employees in the non-operating sector at the lowest possible wages, making the jobs in the operating crafts so undesirable that dedicated career employees will either quit or retire. In spite of warnings from the FRA and commitments they made in the last round of bargaining, they have refused to address and improve the training for all operating employees.
Under the Carriers' last and final proposal for health care benefits, railroad workers would be required to pay approximately $204.40 per month toward their Health and Welfare. In addition, their annual deductible and coinsurance would increase to the point that our Health and Welfare plan would look nothing like it does today. Their Section 6 Notice demands that the employees contribute 1/3 of the cost of Health and Welfare which would amount to $378.42 per month per employee. When one considers in addition to the $204.40 per month, the increases in annual deductible and coinsurance changes set forth in their last and final proposal, the 1/3 cost is less expensive.
The carriers' entire position throughout this round of bargaining has been orchestrated by the BNSF. In regards to the operating employees, the carriers' position is based on experimental technology that has not been proven to be reliable. It is nothing more than "safety be damned" and they are attempting to use a prototype to eliminate crew members. This is no different than the carriers plan to contract out the non-operating union's work.
An example of the lies that are being told by the carriers is contained in the attached article from the May edition of Trains Magazine wherein the BNSF Assistant President of Net Work Control Systems stated the following; "The system is in no way a step toward employee elimination. That's not our goal that's not even our vision." This is an individual that wo

What themes and emotions were expressed by the inmates and USF students during the poetry readings in the text
------------correct----------------------
e with his current prison life.
USF student, Kevin read “World Pool.” Kevin’s words brought to mind the simple act of making tea, e.g., a steaming pot and swirling leaves. However, the words transformed the tea making process into a human character being swirled into a hypnotic, drug-like state.
“World Pool” took me to an unexpected place in literature,” an inmate said.
Inmate Paul Stauffer read a poem “Hollywood Dream.” His words, “Worshiping themselves who never was,” point out the falsity and sham in the lives of Los Angeles socialites.
Steinberg wrote about her days of overcoming panic attacks through “I Remember.” The inmates were visibly moved as they listened to her internal struggle and pain. “I felt really empowered to continue writing. The Brothers in Pen were very supportive, so it made me realize that you are never alone, even if you think you are.”
Jasmine read “First Memory,” recalling what fear looks like for a child. The piece focused on overcoming pain and getting back to the state of childhood innocence. In her fear, she wrote, “I remember trying to make myself as small as possible. I remember feeling confused. I remember starting the next morning like nothing had happened.”
After listening to the USF students, Rahsaan Thomas said, “What I’ve learned from hearing your stories is that inmates are not solely subjected to painful lives. Pain is universal.”
USF student Spencer read “I Remember You,” which was about his struggle with alcoholism. He stressed the importance of getting to step one. He wrote, “I found a conscious reason not to relapse and get back on track.”
One USF student read “Treasure,” a poem about self-imagery that advocates taking great pride in yourself by seeing yourself as a treasure. Another USF student read a poem that critically examined a consumer-based economy. “House of Hell” takes a walk in the city, recognizing the power of capitalism through consumption.
Inmate Justin “Clown” Medvin ended the event by reading “The Rose that Grew from Ash,” an expressive poem asserting life could be built from ruins.
“Coming to prison for the first time was a bit intimidating, said Gabe Nikias. “I emerged with a significantly changed perspective, making the seemingly obvious observation that even ‘criminals’ are pretty normal folks at heart.”
“No matter who you are, what you’ve seen or where you’re from, we all long to be recognized, appreciated and loved,” said USF student Elizabeth M. “I could tell it was a safe space for the Brothers in Pen to share their work and tell their stories.”
Rovzar and her colleague, Stephen Novotny, began a poetry workshop at San Quentin.

What are the names of the five demonstrator apps being launched in the NHS's new digital tool library
------------correct----------------------
Five apps will help launch NHS’s new digital tool library, including the private video consultation on-demand service Babylon Health.
A presentation to the National Information Board last month reveals that five “demonstrator apps” will be launched in September this year.
Visitors to NHS.uk, the successor to the NHS Choices website that will host the digital tool library, will be able to “navigate to local demonstrators of care specific enabled apps”.
These apps include:
- Babylon Health
- Patient Knows Best
- eRedbook (developed by Sitekit)
- An Alzheimer’s app developed by Salesforce
- An unspecified end of life personal health record
NHS Digital are also considering a further three apps for inclusion, including “digital sleep improvement” app Sleepio, patient data capture app uMotif, and appointment booking app Zesty.
Digital Health News reported last week that a beta version of the latest attempt at an NHS digital tool or app library will go live at the end of March.
An NHS Digital spokeswoman told Digital Health News no further details would be released about the demonstrator apps until at least next month, when a beta NHS.uk and digital tools library are scheduled to launch.
Most of the named app companies approached by Digital Health News for this story, confirmed they had been some early talks with NHS Digital but their app had not yet been endorsed.
A Babylon Health spokeswoman said the company had “yet to receive official notification that Babylon has been selected as a demonstrator app for the new library” and declined to comment further.
The Babylon app provides clinical video consultation, largely GPs, on demand through your phone for a monthly subscription fee. However, recently the company has been working with a small group of GP practices to offer the service for free and last year also released a triage chatbot function.

------------correct----------------------
I've seen checklists of resources that have information on this topic that you can access. Browse the web as well as discover the details you need and afterwards share it with others that are concerned concerning this vital topic.Severe Pain In Hip Thigh And Knee
As constantly, be sure to get routine check ups from a certified chiropractic physician. This is the most effective means to keep your hips healthy and balanced. A chiropractic doctor will be able to determine any kind of troubles in your pose or your hip flexor muscles. She or he can then work with you to enhance those muscles and also to recover the proper position.Severe Pain In Hip Thigh And Knee
Some people experience signs similar to those explained over. This may include a pains or discomfort in the buttock, hips, groin, or knee. Other people may experience numbness or a prickling sensation down their legs or in their arms or fingers. In some cases individuals really feel pain, thickness and also a weakness in their legs. This can be triggered by trochanteric bursitis, which is inflammation of the sac containing the trochanterin, a little fluid-filled bag that is produced by the nerve that becomes part of the hip joint.
Severe Pain In Hip Thigh And Knee
There are several stretches that will help relieve this issue. One of the most typical go for the hips is the cat stretch. It is called this since it goes from the hip to the ball of the foot. An additional stretch involves lying on your back with your knees up as well as a fist resting under the buttocks. With your feet hip size apart, gently draw your curved knees towards the breast and also pull your toes upwards towards the head. You need to feel a stretch in the hamstring muscular tissues that add the hip shaft as well as down the back of the legs.
One more stretch entails resting on your back with your buttocks extended. While your legs are straight, draw the inside of your knees toward your chest. You will feel the stretch in the hamstring muscle mass that run up and also down the back of your legs. Repeat on the other side. If you can not get to over and touch your toes, you can utilize a tiny block to support them. If you can not pull your butt to the ground, you might want to have a person delicately use pressure or take a break.
One last stretch entails reclining number 4 stretch. This stretch is less complicated than the cat stretch. To carry out the reclined number 4 stretch, very first pull your knees right to the floor with the rounds of your feet. Next off, flex your knees so your feet are resting on the floor. Currently, cross your legs over one another and area one foot in the front of the other with the heel touching the floor.

What incident inspired Wise to consider the issues surrounding sports team names and mascots
------------correct----------------------
who support the team name. In politics, liberals often use such shaming tactics to promote policies they believe advance their ideas of “social justice.”
He said he is accused of being a “leftist social engineer” or having “White guilt,” and noted “White guilt” could just as well be called “human compassion.”
Wise said after he graduated from college, he was inspired by an article in USA Today about a five-year-old boy who went to a high school game in Minnesota and was humiliated by the Indian mascots, war paint, and chants.

A new type of drug-resistant germ is spreading across the country, raising eyebrows at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, Ga., and at hospitals across the country.
The bacteria simply known as CRE (or carbapenemase resistant Enterobacteriaceae) has become resistant to most antibiotics, with the CDC citing one study where up to 50 percent of cases of patients with the bacteria become fatal.
Locally, Piedmont Medical Center in Rock Hill reports five cases patients infected of the bacteria since 2011.
Statistics from other area hospitals were not immediately available Thursday night.

What types of writing do the San Quentin inmates, known as Brothers in Pen, produce during Zoe Mullery's workshops
------------correct----------------------
For the past 15 years, writing instructor Zoe Mullery has spent each Wednesday night in a small, crowded room listening to and commenting on stories written by San Quentin inmates.
The inmates, called Brothers in Pen, produce a variety of works, including memoirs, science fiction, short stories and urban novels.
“There’s something that happens in this room that’s dear to me,” Mullery says of her weekly workshops.
On one recent Wednesday, Annie Rovzar, a University of San Francisco (USF) creative writing instructor, and her students joined the Brothers in Pen.
Rovzar said when she discovered Mullery’s workshop she thought an interaction between her students and Brothers in Pen would be constructive.
Alexandra, a USF student, said when she heard about the prison’s writing workshop, she “wanted to come here and share with you guys.” Alexandra, a communications major, explained, “I took creative writing because it’s something I like doing.”
“Hopefully we can learn something from you, and you can learn something from us,” said inmate James Metters, who has been in Mullery’s workshop for about a year and a half.
Shira Steinberg took the USF creative writing class because she says, “It’s the one place I can be honest,” adding that she wants to become a child sociologist.
The students and inmates took turns reading their work, with all the participants commenting. The back and forth continued until everyone had read.
The USF students read pieces from a class assignment that required them to reflect on a significant memory.
USF student Paul read “My First Car Accident,” a childhood memory about being the victim of a hit-and-run driver. He wrote, “I remember the air being still that day. I heard the sudden drift of the tires.” His vivid recall of the event left the class asking if he fully recovered physically from the accident. He said, “Yes, I even play basketball now.”
Mitchell Fryer has been in Mullery’s Creative Writing Workshop for about six months. He read “Some People,” a poem about self-identification through comparing and contrasting life from his perspective. Fryer also read “What Would It Take,” about the trials and tribulations of living a hard life.
USF student Shelby Black read “Well Child,” a poem that reflects how she sees life. It instructs readers not to take life too seriously, keep a level head and live freely. “Buy shoes you’ll never wear, and stop texting me and talk to me.” Black is a journalism student and writes for The Foghorn, the college newspaper.
Ron “Coach” Koehler read two poems. “Fear,” which is reminiscent of Franz Kafka’s obscure tension between man and the state, as one line read: “science has disappeared into fiction.” He also read a piece that connected pre-prison lif

The collective was formed when she found a collaborator in musical director and producer Mahlon Rhamie, who had been disappointed by the quality of agency-sourced session musicians. ‘He decided that the only option was to find someone who could set up a pool of musicians with him,’ said Dance.
The collective launched with 15 players, including both women and men. They are all classically trained but have a ?variety of backgrounds in jazz, gospel, big band and world music. There is also a diversity in ages, from mid-20s to early 40s, which Dance views as important in challenging the upper age caps that, she has observed, often accompany the looks requirement in session jobs.
She said that the interest shown in the group so far by producers has been encouraging: ‘The projects we’ve been offered show that there is a desire for something new, as well as a place for the more traditional all-girl group.’

nusitis Medication: Nowadays antibiotic resistance has become very common as the bacteria that are causing sinus infections are becoming antibiotics resistant which means they are becoming immune to the effects of certain antibiotics prescribed by the doctor. Therefore, infections like sinusitis are becoming challenging to treat. However, expert physicians and ENT specialists don’t prescribe antibiotics when you first see them and may advise you to wait for at least a week to see whether the mild sinus infection and its symptoms are getting better on its own – as the body will fight the infections naturally. Follow the instructions of the doctor, if he or she prescribes antibiotic to you; then take the medicines as per the instructions and follow the regimen even if you are relieved of symptoms prior to completing your therapy.
Sinus Remedies: Apart from sinus medicine usage sinus blockage treatment involves inhaling steam or using best saline nasal sprays or nose spray for sinus – which will help relieve sinus discomfort.
When does acute sinusitis become chronic?
If you have sinusitis, which is persistent with bouts of regular infections with associated symptoms for up to three months or more – then it is indicative of chronic sinusitis. The symptoms associated with chronic sinusitis are less severe than that of acute sinusitis – yet the damage caused due to chronic condition is more – and therefore, surgery becomes necessary to repair the damage.
What is the Cure for sinus infection or Best Cure for sinusitis?
Chronic sinusitis treatment: If a person has a sinus infection and is presented with three to four symptoms of sinusitis, he or she must see the best doctor for sinusitis
The treatment for bacterial sinusitis involves sinus medication, i.e., antibiotics therapy. If the sinusitis becomes persistent & prolong, then the best cure for sinusitis is intensive antibiotic therapy; and therefore, your doctor may prescribe sinus medication to treat bacterial sinusitis or chronic sinusitis. Surgery may sometimes become necessary to remove physical obstructions that may contribute to sinusitis.
Is surgery required for sinusitis?
Surgery may become absolutely indispensable if antibiotic therapy for sinusitis fails owing to a nasal obstruction that cannot be removed by using medicines. The best sinus specialist doctor in Hyderabad will select an appropriate surgical procedure by considering the unique requirement of the patient and their condition.
Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) is one such procedure, which is recommended by an ENT specialist to treat a certain type of sinus condition. In this type of surgical technique, the surgeon directs an endoscope into the nose along with other instruments and removes diseased tissues and polyps to clean the narrow channels of the sinuses. The surgeon may use local or general anaesthetic depending on the condition of the patient and their individual preferences.
If surgery has been suggested to you by your surgeon, then ensure that you have realistic expectations about the course of the treatment – the possible outcomes, post-operative care, recovery and health. Good outcomes are possible with good understanding between the patient and his or her surgeon and cooperative efforts between them and also when the patient follows the pre and post-operative instructions of the surgeon diligently.

What should managers do if an employee does not demonstrate improvement after receiving guidance for their weakness
------------correct----------------------
or mitigate areas that may need improvement.
Step 4: Observe how he or she reacts to and implements the direction provided. In most cases, people are able to rise to the challenge and get ahead of the learning curve. Unfortunately, in others, it may be possible that they do not possess the capability or the will to do what is necessary to overcome their challenge in order to succeed in their role. In such incidences, it’s important to recognize this and take appropriate action. While it’s difficult to make such decisions, it’s in the best interest of the employee and the team. After providing the individual with appropriate opportunity to improve, if improvement does not occur, it is best to let the employee move on to find the career path that is best suited to his or her skill set. It is also best for the team as a whole not to retain a significant under-performer.
Overcoming a weakness often requires persistence and consistency on the part of the manager and the employee. It is extremely rewarding to see improvement over time. For instance, one recruiter on my team was very strong in developing relationships with job seekers looking for a career move, but joined the team without prior experience developing new business with clients. I worked with this individual, providing appropriate guidance. As a result of a consistent focus on coaching and strengthening this area of his daily work routine, I have seen a sustained change over time. This recruiter is now demonstrating solid movement in the right direction and has attained more balance with much stronger business development effort and results. This has not only benefited the recruiter; it has also benefited our entire team.
Identifying weaknesses is a skill that all managers should develop and continue to build upon in order to have a thriving, successful team. Have you had employees who lacked a specific skill and were able to turn their weaknesses into strong suits? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

Then, you could be at risk of having sinusitis or sinus problem – as the symptoms of sinusitis often mimic the symptoms of allergies or cold. Many a time, majority of us don’t see a doctor and let the condition get properly diagnosed and treated though the treatment for sinusitis is very much possible if it is diagnosed properly in time.
What is sinusitis?
In sinusitis, the tissue that lines the sinuses becomes inflamed and swollen when fluid builds up in the sinuses. The blocked sinuses become a budding ground for the microbes – as a result, microbes flourish and cause infection and disrupt the normal & smooth flow of air inside the sinuses.
Sinuses drain mucus into the nasal passages when they are normal, but due to allergy, cold or bacterial infections – inflammation of the sinuses does not allow the sinuses to drain mucus. As a result, they become inflamed, swollen and congested. Sinusitis is diagnosed in a person if he or she has purulent nasal discharge for up to four weeks, which is associated with facial pressure, pain, fullness and nasal obstruction.
What are the causes of sinusitis?
Sinusitis may result owing to several causes, such as viral infections – common cold, inflammation and swelling of the nose due to allergic rhinitis; nasal polyps – growth in the lining of the nose; and alterations or changes in the nasal cavity – deviated septum.
What are the types of sinusitis?
Acute sinusitis: This type of sinusitis usually begins like cold and the symptoms include facial pain, running & stuffy nose. The condition may continue as long as 15 days to a month.
Sub-acute sinusitis: This type of sinusitis may last for around one to three months.
Chronic sinusitis: The condition may last for about three months or longer.
Recurrent sinusitis can occur several times a year.
What is acute bacterial sinusitis?
If a sinus infection persists for more than 10 days or longer or when the symptoms exaggerate after improvement in the initial phase of the infection– then it is most likely to be a bacterial infection. Acute bacterial sinusitis is usually followed by a cold, viral or allergy attack – and sometimes by environmental pollutants as well. This type of sinusitis may warrant intervention by a physician for proper diagnosis and treatment and the treatment modality include antibiotics and nose blockage removal.
What are the symptoms of sinusitis?
Sinusitis symptoms: Loss of smell, runny nose, stuffed-up nose, facial pain or pressure, fatigue, sometimes dental pain, bad breathe, fever, cough or congestion are the symptoms of acute sinusitis. The patient may have acute sinusitis if thick yellow or green nasal discharge is associated with the above symptoms.
The symptoms associated with chronic sinusitis include facial pain, pressure and fullness with nasal blockage or obstruction, discoloured postnasal discharge, headache, bad breathe, fever and sometimes pus in the nasal cavity. These symptoms may persist for up to three months or more.
What is the treatment for sinusitis?
The best nasal spray for sinusitis or congestion is a nasal saline spray or nasal congestion spray. Though the prolonged usage of non-prescription nasal spray for sinus congestion or drops should be avoided, but if the spray is used for gaining temporary relief from congestion, then it is advisable.

What is the main concern expressed by the UTU regarding the actions of BNSF and other carriers in relation to labor and rail safety
------------correct----------------------
rks with the new technology regularly. His statement and vision is completely opposite of BNSF Labor Relations and CEO Matt Rose. The carriers' by their actions have declared war on rail labor and UTU is not only prepared to battle, we will fight to the finish and win. What is completely puzzling is why the other carriers' are allowing the BNSF to drag them down based on the rudimentary form of technologies that are not proven to be safe and are years away from being implemented on a non-experimental basis.
It is important that all of our membership realize the seriousness of the carriers' actions. Every member's job is at stake. If Labor friendly candidates are not elected in November, assuring that the Democrats regain control of the House and the Senate, we face very serious problems with the current anti-union Administration. There is no doubt that we are headed to a Presidential Emergency Board after the November election.
The actions of the carriers' are despicable, considering the unprecedented profits the railroads are enjoying as a result of their dedicated employees work. Rail Labor and UTU have always been there to assist the carriers obtain legislation that would benefit the railroad industry. We have helped them receive tax reductions and other benefits, and this is the manner in which they thank those that helped them. Use us and then abuse us is apparently their current motto.
Our strategy, as follows, will require all of our members' cooperation.
1. Work to increase UTU PAC contributions so that we can support and elect those individuals that support working people.
2. Insure that our members, their families and friends register to vote and make sure they vote right on Election Day. The railroads may be able to out spend us, but they cannot out vote us. The numbers are on our side if we use them.-3-
3. In most industries the policy is "the customer always comes first." The railroad industry has taken a different approach. Because of the high cost of fuel, the railroads are attempting to take advantage of the shippers as they attempt to destroy rail labor. UTU will urge the rest of Rail Labor to join with us to make alliances with captive shippers and others who are seeking legislation to limit railroad monopoly power. The UTU and other unions will work with our many friends in congress - Democrats and Republicans - to append shipper-friendly legislation to any congressional back-to-work order imposing carrier-friendly PEB recommendations. We will need all our members support in contacting their elected Representatives when the time is right.
The carriers' intent - in the face of record profitability, new-found monopoly pricing-power, and appalling customer-service failures - is further to their plan to increase bottom lines and executive bonuses by going to one-person crews. For this, the railroads are willing to roll the dice on public safety and national security. They also have proven beyond a shadow of doubt that they care nothing for their dedicated employees that have allowed the railroads to reach record profitability. WE ARE IN THE FIGHT OF OUR LIVES AND I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT AND HELP IN GETTING THIS MESSAGE TO OUR MEMBERSHIP.

How much did foreigner holdings of U.S. government debt increase since the Fed began Treasury purchases in May 2009
------------correct----------------------
e hooked on the monetary morphine we provided” after the 2008 financial crisis, he said.
For all the concern that the $10 trillion market for Treasuries is dependent on Fed purchases to absorb expanding supply, the amount held by investors outside the U.S. has grown even more. Foreigners increased holdings of U.S. government debt by $1.84 trillion to a record $5 trillion since the Fed began the first round of Treasury purchases in May 2009, taking their stake to 60.5 percent of the securities not held by the central bank, government data show. The Fed added $1.18 trillion during that period, to $1.65 trillion, or 16.8 percent of the total.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP) fell 0.6 percent. Rio Tinto Group led mining shares lower as copper slid. Salzgitter AG sank 5.4 percent amid uncertainty over the steelmaker’s outlook. BP Plc advanced 1.6 percent after reaching a $7.8 billion settlement with businesses and individuals harmed by the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010.
Russia’s Micex Index (MICEX) gained 1.1 percent after Vladimir Putin won a presidential election in an endorsement of his pledge to continue to privatize state companies and undertake political reform.
Among European bond markets, rates on Spanish and Italian 10-year debt increased at least two basis points, while remaining below 5 percent. Germany’s 10-year yield added three basis points to 1.83 percent. The rate on Greece’s 10-year debt fell 56 basis points to 36.54 percent after reaching a record 37 percent on March 2, according to Bloomberg generic yields.
Greece expects bondholders to accept a one-time offer to write off about 100 billion euros ($140 billion) of Greek debt and is ready to force them to participate if necessary, Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said.
“This is the best offer,” Venizelos said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Nicole Itano in Athens today. “This is the best offer because this is the only one, the only existing offer.”
The Greek government has set a 75 percent participation rate as a threshold for proceeding with the transaction, in which investors will forgive 53.5 percent of their principal and exchange their remaining holdings for new Greek government bonds and notes from the European Financial Stability Facility.
The private investors that declared their participation in Greece’s debt restructuring hold about 20 percent of the bonds involved in a swap required for an international bailout. The 12 members of the creditors’ steering committee that said today they would join in the exchange have debt with a face value of about 40 billion euros ($53 billion).
The yen climbed 0.3 percent against the euro and advanced 0.5 percent versus the dollar. The euro strengthened 0.2 percent to $1.3224 as it appreciated against 13 of 16 major peers.
The S&P GSCI gauge of commodities was little changed as 18 of 24 materials retreated, overshadowing gains in cotton, corn and heating oil. Cotton jumped the daily maximum allowed of 4 cents a pound, or 4.5 percent, after India halted exports. India is the second-biggest exporter after the U.S.
Speculators increased bets on higher agricultural prices to a five-month high on mounting concern that a South American drought will curb supplies of soybeans, corn and sugar at a time of record global demand. A measure of speculative positions across 11 farm goods jumped 26 percent to 607,721 futures and options in the week ended Feb. 28, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.
China may “appropriately” widen the yuan’s trading band to better reflect market supply and demand, Xinhua News Agency reported, citing People’s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan. Zhou said the yuan has gradually met the requirements to become more of a floating currency, Xinhua reported. As China improves its industrial structure and gradually reduces its trade surplus, the yuan is now moving “very close” to a “balanced level,” Xinhua reported in English, citing Zhou.
In today’s trading, the yuan declined to its weakest level in almost a month. The central bank weakened the currency’s daily fixing by 0.22 percent, setting it at 6.3121 per dollar.
The Taiex index retreated 1.4 percent after Taiwanese technology companies reported slumping sales. The BSE India Sensitive Index fell 1.6 percent before the results of state elections tomorrow that may be crucial in determining the future of the ruling Congress Party’s economic agenda.

What distinguishes Fragonia™ from other essential oils according to the text
------------correct----------------------
I’ve resisted importing this newly discovered essential oil for two or three years now, for philosophical reasons. However many of our clients have asked for it, so we finally bought some in. (We’d bought a tiny amount to use as samples in The Energetic Oils Kit, but not enough to offer at retail.)
Fragonia™ is a fascinating oil. The ONLY trademarked essential oil that I have ever encountered. Evidently there are several varying chemotypes of Agonis fragrans, and only one has the unique balance of this oil. The producer raised a plantation of the specific chemotype, and trademarked the product name. There may or may not be some advantages to the consumer in this; I’m not sure.
However, the oil does appear to have some interesting and beneficial qualities.
The producer says: “Dr. Daniel Penoel has been working to determine the clinical application of this oil. Preliminary work indicates that it has significant anti-microbial activity. It is an extremely balanced oil, with the oxides (cineol…which gives eucalyptus oil its distinctive aroma), monoterpines (alpha pinene), and monoterpenols (linalol, etc.) in a near perfect 1:1:1 ratio.”
Tony Burfield describes the aroma as “a pleasant fresh cineolic odour with a hint of a citrus note (which becomes more pronounced after a few minutes) mixed with a slight spicy cinnamon tonality and sweet balsamic undertones. The dry down is very faint being sweet, soapy and woody balsamic.” I would never call it a favorite, to my nose it still smells quite medicinal, but much pleasanter than, for example, Tea Tree or Niaouli.
I have read that it should be an ideal replacement for Tea Tree, that it is gentle and safe enough for children, and more appealing in aroma. I’ve seen case studies where the use of Fragonia Oil has had amazing results with people suffering from intractable respiratory infections. There are case studies of its being used very effectively i

What is the primary concern expressed in the letter regarding the National Negotiations and the actions of the NCCC and the railroad industry
------------correct----------------------
July 14, 2006
To All International Officers, U.S. Rail General Committees and State Legislative Boards
Dear Sirs and Brothers:
The purpose of this letter is to bring you up to date on the current status of National Negotiations.
As you will determine by reviewing the attached material, the NCCC and the railroad industry are attempting to destroy rail labor. Let me repeat that, the NCCC and the railroad industry are attempting to destroy all of rail labor.
Through out this entire round of negotiations, the NCCC has attempted to pit the two operating organizations against each other with lies and despicable tactics. Their plan has not worked. As you can witness from the enclosed material, the NCCC wants to give all the road work to the BLET and all the yard work to the UTU thereby reducing the jobs of both the UTU and BLET downward. Since UTU and BLET would not give consideration to assisting the Carriers in doing each other in, the last and what we were told is the NCCC's final proposal is to freeze all wages through 2009. New hires would never get above 80% of the full rate in effect on June 30, 2005.
It is not just the UTU and BLET that the Carriers are attempting to destroy, but the non-operating unions as well. They are insisting on the full right to contract out non-operating union's work. They have shown complete disregard for the safety of their employees as well as the public. They want to hire unqualified employees in the non-operating sector at the lowest possible wages, making the jobs in the operating crafts so undesirable that dedicated career employees will either quit or retire. In spite of warnings from the FRA and commitments they made in the last round of bargaining, they have refused to address and improve the training for all operating employees.
Under the Carriers' last and final proposal for health care benefits, railroad workers would be required to pay approximately $204.40 per month toward their Health and Welfare. In addition, their annual deductible and coinsurance would increase to the point that our Health and Welfare plan would look nothing like it does today. Their Section 6 Notice demands that the employees contribute 1/3 of the cost of Health and Welfare which would amount to $378.42 per month per employee. When one considers in addition to the $204.40 per month, the increases in annual deductible and coinsurance changes set forth in their last and final proposal, the 1/3 cost is less expensive.
The carriers' entire position throughout this round of bargaining has been orchestrated by the BNSF. In regards to the operating employees, the carriers' position is based on experimental technology that has not been proven to be reliable. It is nothing more than "safety be damned" and they are attempting to use a prototype to eliminate crew members. This is no different than the carriers plan to contract out the non-operating union's work.
An example of the lies that are being told by the carriers is contained in the attached article from the May edition of Trains Magazine wherein the BNSF Assistant President of Net Work Control Systems stated the following; "The system is in no way a step toward employee elimination. That's not our goal that's not even our vision." This is an individual that wo

Stocks Fall as China Reduces Growth Target; Yen Gains, Treasuries Retreat
Stocks (MXWD) fell for a second day after China announced the lowest economic growth target since 2004 and European services and manufacturing output was less than earlier estimated. The yen climbed, while Treasuries declined.
The S&P 500 lost 0.4 percent to close at 1,364.33 at 4 p.m. in New York and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 14.76 points to 12,962.81. The yen strengthened against all 16 most- traded peers, while China weakened its currency’s daily fixing by the most since November 2010 and said it may widen its trading band. Oil was little changed, while copper slid 1.1 percent and natural gas fell 5.2 percent. Ten-year Treasury yields rose three basis points to 2.005 percent.
China cut the nation’s economic growth target to 7.5 percent from an 8 percent goal in place since 2005, according to Premier Wen Jiabao’s speech at the National People’s Congress today. European services and manufacturing output shrank in February more than earlier estimated, Markit Economics said, and U.S. factory orders fell for the first time in three months. Greece’s private creditors decide this week whether to sign off on the country’s debt restructuring.
“It’s just not an environment that we feel like sticking our neck out to take on a lot of risk,” Michael Mullaney, who helps manage $9.5 billion at Fiduciary Trust in Boston, said in a telephone interview. “We’ve been scratching our heads a little bit after the big run-up in equities. We just don’t see a strong enough global economic background to support where prices are right now.”
Retreat From High
The S&P 500 (SPX) fell for a second day after last week reaching its highest level since 2008. Equities briefly pared losses after the Institute for Supply Management’s index of non- manufacturing industries rose to 57.3 in February, topping the median economist projection for a decline to 56. Commerce Department data showed orders to U.S. factories decreased in January by 1 percent, less than the median prediction for a 1.5 percent drop.
Alcoa Inc., Caterpillar Inc. and Bank of America Corp. lost at least 2 percent to lead declines in the Dow. Zynga Inc. (ZNGA), the online-game company that sold shares to the public in December, and CF Industries Holdings Inc., North America’s largest maker of nitrogen-based fertilizer , tumbled at least 2.9 percent after the companies were downgraded.
Corporate profits that doubled since 2009 have left the S&P 500 cheaper than at all 34 peaks since 1989, even as options traders push the cost of protecting against losses to the highest in four years relative to the cost of betting on gains.
Companies in the benchmark gauge of U.S. stocks (MXWD) trade for 14 times earnings after advancing 102 percent since March 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg that excludes peaks occurring within a month of one another. Valuations are lower than at every 52-week peak since 1989. Traders have pushed the price of contracts that pay should the S&P 500 drop 20 percent to the most since 2007 compared with ones betting on a rally of the same size.
Technology and consumer-discretionary stocks, which have led this year’s rally in the S&P 500 along with financials, may perform worse than other shares as American economic reports struggle to beat rising forecasts, according to Tobias Levkovich, chief U.S. equity strategist at Citigroup Inc.
A drop in Citigroup’s Economic Surprise Index (CESIUSD) for the U.S. is one of several concerns for the market in the short-term, Levkovich said. The index, which measures the extent to which reports beat or miss forecasts, has fallen to 48.2 from 83.70 on Feb. 3. Consumer-discretionary and technology shares show some of the highest correlations to the gauge and “are vulnerable to a pullback,” the report said.
‘Dr. Fed;’ ‘Monetary Morphine’
Two-year Treasury yields increased two basis points to 0.30 percent and 30-year rates added four basis points to 3.15 percent today. Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher said he opposes additional Fed purchases of securities and urged Wall Street to get ready to become less dependent on monetary easing.
“I would suggest to you that, if the data continue to improve, however gradually, the markets should begin preparing themselves for the good Dr. Fed to wean them from their dependency rather than administer further dosage,” Fisher said today in the text of a speech in Dallas. Financial markets “have becom

James Renfro to Patsey, Christiany and James Gilbert
This indenture, made and concluded this first day of July Anno Domini Eighteen hundred and fifteen between James Renfrow for and of the state of North Carolina and Cumberland of the First part, and Patsey Gilbert, Christianny Gilbert and James Gilbert daughters and son of Ede Gilbert of the other part. witnesseth, that I the said James Renfro doth give, grant, alienate, enfeoff, release and confirm unto Patsey Gilbert Christiany Gilbert and James Gilbert daughters and son of the said Ede Gilbert a certain tract or parcel of land situated lying and being in our County of Cumberland and state aforesaid on the North side of Black River containing by estimation two hundred and fifty acres bothe same more or less bonded followeth towit beginning in Atkins line on a stake thence south on said Atkins line to his corner a stake, thence West to a stake, thence South to their old line to a stake. thence East on the said line to a White Oak on Shuffolds Branch thence down said branch to the river, thence up the various course of the said river until it excesses the old line to a stake, thence as that line West to Red Oak then Northward to the mouth of the Spring Branch, thence up the said branch to the back line on a stake, thence East on that line to the beginning Also I do give grant alienate enfeoff release and confirm unto the said Patsy Gilbert Christianny Gilbert and James Gilbert daughters and son of Ede Gilbert three cows and calves one bed and furniture one pot and skillet and some pewter and sundry other household stuff all of which I the said James Renfro do by these presents agree to warrant and forever defend the said land and other property herein mentioned unto them the said Patsey Gilbert Christianny Gilbert and James Gilbert daughters and son of the said Ede Gilbert their heirs and assigns forever against any person or persons having any lawful claim to the same with this exception that I the said James Renfro am not debared from making any reasonable use of the said property for my support and the said Ede Gilbert is to be supported with the said property enduring her natural life or so long as she the said Ede Gilbert doth continue single but if she marrieth then the said property to belong to the said children towit Patsey Gilbert Christianny Gilbert and James Gilbert daughters and son of the said Ede Gilbert In Witness Herewith I the said James Renfro doth hereinunto set my hand and seal this 3rd day of July 1815.
I already checked the original to make sure Patsey wasn’t Peggy. It’s not. It’s clearly Patsey. I have researched the three Gilbert children, but I cannot find out anything else about them.
On June 9, 1814, Edith married James Renfrow in Cumberland County, North Carolina. We can assume Peggy wasn’t from this union because she was born in 1801. James and Edith did have two children: the above mentioned James Renfrow and Rebecca Renfrow who married James Wright (also in Lincoln County, Tennessee).
In 1830, Edith is living in White County, Tennessee under the name Edith Swindle. That was at least her third marriage, and that is the name she kept the rest of her life. We don’t know her maiden name.
We can assume Peggy was close to Edith and her son James Renfrow from the pension application, church records, and Edith being buried beside Peggy. However, Peggy and James would be half-siblings at most. It doesn’t seem likely that Peggy was Edith’s daughter from her first marriage to James Gilbert because she was not listed in the deed. There are a few options left:
- Peggy was Edith and James Gilbert’s daughter. Her younger half-siblings were James and Rebecca Renfrow.
- Peggy was James Gilbert’s sister, making Edith her sister-in-law. James Gilbert’s brother, Jesse Gilbert, married Elizabeth Pylant who was Pinkney’s sister.
- Peggy was James Renfrow’s daughter from his first marriage, making Edith her step mother, and James and Rebecca Renfrow her half-siblings.
None of these explanations completely make sense to me when we take the available records into consideration. To add to the confusion, I found another interesting record.
During her senior years, Peggy was living with her son, Felix Pylant. Felix didn’t pass away until 1922. His mother’s name is listed as “Margrett Renfrow”. Surely a child would know their mother’s maiden name, right? Not always. I’ve seen it mixed up or wrong before. Did the informant get it wrong? Is it possible, since James Renfrow didn’t die until 1901, that they just knew that James was Peggy’s brother and assumed she was a Renfrow too?
Confusing, isn’t it?
I would love to be able to find out whom Peggy’s parents are! I’ll keep searching.

It’s important to identify and address weaknesses in individuals in order to build a strong, cohesive team that can succeed.
Recognizing individual strengths and weaknesses within a team helps to create balance, ultimately leading to a great, successful team. As a manager leading a team of nine, I have learned how to identify weaknesses within my team members and address them in order to build a strong, cohesive team. There are several steps you can take to identify and address weaknesses to hopefully turn them into strengths over time.
Step 1: When bringing on new team members, I generally start by managing and training them in the same manner, then modify the training as we move forward based upon my observations of the individual’s strengths and challenges. Each person learns differently, and it is important to adapt one’s management approach in order to support the individual’s success.
Step 2: Identify the individual’s weakness, and be specific. In the recruiting industry, these challenges may range from business development to technical understanding of the specific industry in which we work. In general, some of the more common weaknesses that can show up in otherwise strong team members can be anything from lack of follow up to a team member who gets bogged down in the mundane tasks rather than dedicating the time to the strategic items on their his or her to do list. Whatever the weaknesses of the people you manage may be, understanding them and developing a strategy for overcoming them is key to combating these issues.
Step 3: Address the weakness. In a constructive manner, sit down with the individual and discuss your observation of the challenge. Talk through the area in which he or she needs to improve. Provide mentoring on how to further develop work-arounds to ensure these weaknesses do not inhibit their day to day work, and a specific action plan he or she can follow order to further develop and eventually overcome these areas they may be falling short. Also, leverage their particular strengths to compensate

What are the major symptoms of acute sinusitis
------------correct----------------------
Treatment for sinus infection or chronic sinusitis – Are you the one who always get cold and allergy attack accompanied with a runny nose, sneezing, red, stuffy nose, facial pressure, facial pain and discomfort? Then, you could be at risk of having sinusitis or sinus problem – as the symptoms of sinusitis often mimic the symptoms of allergies or cold. Many a time, majority of us don’t see a doctor and let the condition get properly diagnosed and treated though the treatment for sinusitis is very much possible if it is diagnosed properly in time.
What is sinusitis?
In sinusitis, the tissue that lines the sinuses becomes inflamed and swollen when fluid builds up in the sinuses. The blocked sinuses become a budding ground for the microbes – as a result, microbes flourish and cause infection and disrupt the normal & smooth flow of air inside the sinuses.
Sinuses drain mucus into the nasal passages when they are normal, but due to allergy, cold or bacterial infections – inflammation of the sinuses does not allow the sinuses to drain mucus. As a result, they become inflamed, swollen and congested. Sinusitis is diagnosed in a person if he or she has purulent nasal discharge for up to four weeks, which is associated with facial pressure, pain, fullness and nasal obstruction.
What are the causes of sinusitis?
Sinusitis may result owing to several causes, such as viral infections – common cold, inflammation and swelling of the nose due to allergic rhinitis; nasal polyps – growth in the lining of the nose; and alterations or changes in the nasal cavity – deviated septum.
What are the types of sinusitis?
Acute sinusitis: This type of sinusitis usually begins like cold and the symptoms include facial pain, running & stuffy nose. The condition may continue as long as 15 days to a month.
Sub-acute sinusitis: This type of sinusitis may last for around one to three months.
Chronic sinusitis: The condition may last for about three months or longer.
Recurrent sinusitis can occur several times a year.
What is acute bacterial sinusitis?
If a sinus infection persists for more than 10 days or longer or when the symptoms exaggerate after improvement in the initial phase of the infection– then it is most likely to be a bacterial infection. Acute bacterial sinusitis is usually followed by a cold, viral or allergy attack – and sometimes by environmental pollutants as well. This type of sinusitis may warrant intervention by a physician for proper diagnosis and treatment and the treatment modality include antibiotics and nose blockage removal.
What are the symptoms of sinusitis?
Sinusitis symptoms: Loss of smell, runny nose, stuffed-up nose, facial pain or pressure, fatigue, sometimes dental pain, bad breathe, fever, cough or congestion are the symptoms of acute sinusitis. The patient may have acute sinusitis if thick yellow or green nasal discharge is associated with the above symptoms.
The symptoms associated with chronic sinusitis include facial pain, pressure and fullness with nasal blockage or obstruction, discoloured postnasal discharge, headache, bad breathe, fever and sometimes pus in the nasal cavity. These symptoms may persist for up to three months or more.
What is the treatment for sinusitis?
The best nasal spray for sinusitis or congestion is a nasal saline spray or nasal congestion spray. Though the prolonged usage of non-prescription nasal spray for sinus congestion or drops should be avoided, but if the spray is used for gaining temporary relief from congestion, then it is advisable.

It is said to be antimicrobial, as well as helpful with candida. It is also said to be a powerful anti-inflammatory, and a pain reliever, especially helpful with the pain associated with arthritis, as well as muscle and joint pain. Dr. Penoel strongly recommends it for all respiratory disorders, whether in sinus areas or in the lungs. It is also said to stimulate and enhance the immune system.
However this new oil seems to have amazingly strong emotional effects, having a deep action on the psyche. There are case studies of people with longstanding emotional blockages who were able to find release. The essential oil seems to both release tension and have a relaxing/calming effect on the mind. Dr. Peneol says that the use of Fragonia at bedtime will improve the depth and the relaxing effects of sleep.
Several writers have mentioned Fragonia Essential Oil’s effect of bringing peace and inner harmony to those using it.
Robbi Zeck has written this reflection on Fragonia in The Blossoming Heart.
I write this review on the day we received our shipment. I’ve sampled the oil, but not had time to experiment with it. But tonight it will be Fragonia in the Aroma Stone beside my bed.
(Months later) At first Christi was much more enthusiastic about this new oil than I was. However, when she created her Relax Synergy, that became an immediate favorite of mine, and using it lead to my growing appreciation for the balancing and respiratory effects of Fragonia. My grandson has found that it seems to ease his chronic asthma. Not a replacement for a rescue inhaler, but used (by inhalation) on a daily basis it seems to reduce his need for the rescue inhaler. It is a key ingredient in our Deep Breath blend.

or mitigate areas that may need improvement.
Step 4: Observe how he or she reacts to and implements the direction provided. In most cases, people are able to rise to the challenge and get ahead of the learning curve. Unfortunately, in others, it may be possible that they do not possess the capability or the will to do what is necessary to overcome their challenge in order to succeed in their role. In such incidences, it’s important to recognize this and take appropriate action. While it’s difficult to make such decisions, it’s in the best interest of the employee and the team. After providing the individual with appropriate opportunity to improve, if improvement does not occur, it is best to let the employee move on to find the career path that is best suited to his or her skill set. It is also best for the team as a whole not to retain a significant under-performer.
Overcoming a weakness often requires persistence and consistency on the part of the manager and the employee. It is extremely rewarding to see improvement over time. For instance, one recruiter on my team was very strong in developing relationships with job seekers looking for a career move, but joined the team without prior experience developing new business with clients. I worked with this individual, providing appropriate guidance. As a result of a consistent focus on coaching and strengthening this area of his daily work routine, I have seen a sustained change over time. This recruiter is now demonstrating solid movement in the right direction and has attained more balance with much stronger business development effort and results. This has not only benefited the recruiter; it has also benefited our entire team.
Identifying weaknesses is a skill that all managers should develop and continue to build upon in order to have a thriving, successful team. Have you had employees who lacked a specific skill and were able to turn their weaknesses into strong suits? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

and Control says when the bacteria is identified by a laboratory, careful precautions are put into place to protect other patients, staff and visitors.
Raymes says once the lab is notified of an incident, quick steps are put into place that go beyond typical precautions, including the strict monitoring of invasive tools and monitoring of cross-contamination though an equipment cleaning program.
Raymes says in addition to state-mandated steps to prevent the spread of the bacteria, simple steps can take place outside the hospital setting to protect yourself.

Raymes says in addition to state-mandated steps to prevent the spread of the bacteria, simple steps can take place outside the hospital setting to protect yourself.

I feel like I am trying to put together a puzzle that has just one missing piece. Do you have the missing piece or know where I can find it?
My fifth great-grandmother was named Margaret but went by Peggy. She was born March 7, 1801 to unknown parents – that’s the problem. She was born in Cumberland County, North Carolina.
At the age of 19, on October 20, 1820, she married Pinkney Lee Pylant in Cumberland County, North Carolina. She used the name Pagey (Peggy) Gilbert on the marriage document. However, this isn’t case closed for her last name. Type in a Google search or check out ancestry.com if you’d like to become VERY confused. At some unknown point, it was suggested her last name was really Renfrow.
I am tired of calling her Margaret Peggy Gilbert Renfrow or Margaret Peggy Renfrow Gilbert…can we just drop one name? In frustration, I decided to do research to compile how this confusion got started in the first place.
I first examined her later years for clues. Pinkney and Peggy settled in Lincoln County, Tennessee on Norris Creek near Belleville. She’s there on the 1850, 1860, 1870 and 1880 census records. In 1870 and 1880, she’s living with her son Felix and his family. (In 1880, Felix’s name was wrongly transcribed as Thos. All census records mentioned are pulled from Ancestry.)
Here are their known children:
William Pylant 1820–1866
Gabriel Pylant 1821–1905
Green Allen Pylant 1823–1905
Penina Pylant 1825–1907
Gray Pylant 1828–
Harry Jackson Pylant 1828–1880
John Lee Pylant 1830–1896
Margaret Ann Pylant 1832–1860
James Crawford Pylant 1835–1908
William Gilford Pylant 1837–1919
Francis Marion Pylant 1840–1864
Felix Grundy Pylant 1842–1922
Her husband Pinkney died in 1861, and Peggy applied for a widow’s pension for Pinkney’s service during the War of 1812. Transcribed below.
Application # 30066
State of Tennessee County of Lincoln
On this second day of August A.D. eighteen hundred and seventy-eight personally appeared before me, Paul D. Boyce, Clerk of the County Court, a Court of Record in and for the County and State aforesaid, Margaret Pylant aged seventy-seven years, a resident of Norris Creek, County of Lincoln, State of Tennessee, who being duly sworn according to law, declares that she is the widow of Pinkney Pylant who served the full period of fourteen days in the military service of the United States in the War of 1812, and who was the identical Pinkney Pylant who enlisted in Captain John Green’s Company, North Carolina Militia at Raleigh, North Carolina in 1814, and was honorably discharged at Norfolk, Virginia in 1815; that he served in said Company as a Private the last five or six months of the war. The precise date of enlistment and discharge not remembered, nor can the applicant designate the Regiment, Brigade & Division of the Army; that she married under the name of Peggy Gilbert to said Pinkney Pylant on the twelvth day of September A.D. 1820 by John Burch, a Justice of the Peace of Cumberland Co., N.C. in said Co., there being no legal barrier to such marriage; that her said husband died at Norris Creek, Lincoln Co., Tenn. on the twenty-first day of September 1861 and that she has not remarried since his death; that she is not in receipt of a pension under any previous act; that she makes this declaration for the purpose of being placed on the pension rolls of the United States, under the provision of the act approved March 9, 1878, and hereby constitutes and appoints, with full power of substitution and revocation, Holman & Holman, of Fayetteville, Tennessee, her true and lawful attorneys to prosecute her claim, and obtain the pension certificate that may be issued; that her post-office is at Norris Creek, County of Lincoln, State of Tennessee; that her domicile or place of abode is Norris Creek, Lincoln County, Tennessee.
Peggy Pylant, applicant
Attest: Isham Sorrells, Jas. F. Renfrow
Rejected Feb. 21st, 1879 on the ground that there is no record evidence of the service of the organization in which individual service is alleged in the War of 1812.
This document is important because we have the name of her two witnesses. Isham Sorrells married her daughter Penina, so he would be her son-in-law. The other was James F. Renfrow.
James Renfrow attended church with the Pylant family at Mt. Hebron Presbyterian Church. (Here is a website that transcribes the church’s records.) James was born about 1815, so he was about 14 years younger than Peggy.
I researched James and found that he was also born in Cumberland County, North Carolina. Hang on, because this is where this REALLY gets confusing.
James Renfrow’s mother was named Edith Swindle / Swindell (married name). She lived with James until her death in 1868. You can find her on the 1850 and 1860 census in his home. She was also a member of the Mt. Hebron Presbyterian Church. AND guess where she’s buried? In the Pylant Cemetery beside Peggy & Pinkney Pylant! That may not seem so odd at first, but it’s a small cemetery with only Pylants (9 to be exact) buried there. Here’s a link to the list of graves.
In my investigation of Edith, I found that she was born February 3, 1782 in North Carolina. Her first marriage was to a James GILBERT. We know

What methods did Mike Wise suggest for changing the Washington Redskins team name during the symposium at the Smithsonian American Indian Museum
------------correct----------------------
Washington Post sports reporter Mike Wise suggested the Washington Redskins should be shamed into changing their team name and predicted the football team would be forced to do so during his lifetime.
Wise made his remarks on Thursday at a symposium at the Smithsonian American Indian Museum about “Racial Stereotypes and Cultural Appropriation in American Sports.” Wise was on a five-person panel that discussed the Washington Redskins name.
“I believe in my lifetime that symbol will disappear from this town,” Wise said, of the Redskins name. “And when it does, there will be a lot of people to thank.”
He said there is going to be another huge fight on changing the Redskins name, and it’s “going to come soon.”
Wise said proponents of the Redskins name will never be convinced to change, so the only way to do so is to embarrass and shame them. He said the same tactics used to embarrass people in politics should be applied to pressure the Redskins and those

rks with the new technology regularly. His statement and vision is completely opposite of BNSF Labor Relations and CEO Matt Rose. The carriers' by their actions have declared war on rail labor and UTU is not only prepared to battle, we will fight to the finish and win. What is completely puzzling is why the other carriers' are allowing the BNSF to drag them down based on the rudimentary form of technologies that are not proven to be safe and are years away from being implemented on a non-experimental basis.
It is important that all of our membership realize the seriousness of the carriers' actions. Every member's job is at stake. If Labor friendly candidates are not elected in November, assuring that the Democrats regain control of the House and the Senate, we face very serious problems with the current anti-union Administration. There is no doubt that we are headed to a Presidential Emergency Board after the November election.
The actions of the carriers' are despicable, considering the unprecedented profits the railroads are enjoying as a result of their dedicated employees work. Rail Labor and UTU have always been there to assist the carriers obtain legislation that would benefit the railroad industry. We have helped them receive tax reductions and other benefits, and this is the manner in which they thank those that helped them. Use us and then abuse us is apparently their current motto.
Our strategy, as follows, will require all of our members' cooperation.
1. Work to increase UTU PAC contributions so that we can support and elect those individuals that support working people.
2. Insure that our members, their families and friends register to vote and make sure they vote right on Election Day. The railroads may be able to out spend us, but they cannot out vote us. The numbers are on our side if we use them.-3-
3. In most industries the policy is "the customer always comes first." The railroad industry has taken a different approach. Because of the high cost of fuel, the railroads are attempting to take advantage of the shippers as they attempt to destroy rail labor. UTU will urge the rest of Rail Labor to join with us to make alliances with captive shippers and others who are seeking legislation to limit railroad monopoly power. The UTU and other unions will work with our many friends in congress - Democrats and Republicans - to append shipper-friendly legislation to any congressional back-to-work order imposing carrier-friendly PEB recommendations. We will need all our members support in contacting their elected Representatives when the time is right.
The carriers' intent - in the face of record profitability, new-found monopoly pricing-power, and appalling customer-service failures - is further to their plan to increase bottom lines and executive bonuses by going to one-person crews. For this, the railroads are willing to roll the dice on public safety and national security. They also have proven beyond a shadow of doubt that they care nothing for their dedicated employees that have allowed the railroads to reach record profitability. WE ARE IN THE FIGHT OF OUR LIVES AND I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT AND HELP IN GETTING THIS MESSAGE TO OUR MEMBERSHIP.

What happens if antibiotic therapy for sinusitis fails due to a nasal obstruction
------------correct----------------------
nusitis Medication: Nowadays antibiotic resistance has become very common as the bacteria that are causing sinus infections are becoming antibiotics resistant which means they are becoming immune to the effects of certain antibiotics prescribed by the doctor. Therefore, infections like sinusitis are becoming challenging to treat. However, expert physicians and ENT specialists don’t prescribe antibiotics when you first see them and may advise you to wait for at least a week to see whether the mild sinus infection and its symptoms are getting better on its own – as the body will fight the infections naturally. Follow the instructions of the doctor, if he or she prescribes antibiotic to you; then take the medicines as per the instructions and follow the regimen even if you are relieved of symptoms prior to completing your therapy.
Sinus Remedies: Apart from sinus medicine usage sinus blockage treatment involves inhaling steam or using best saline nasal sprays or nose spray for sinus – which will help relieve sinus discomfort.
When does acute sinusitis become chronic?
If you have sinusitis, which is persistent with bouts of regular infections with associated symptoms for up to three months or more – then it is indicative of chronic sinusitis. The symptoms associated with chronic sinusitis are less severe than that of acute sinusitis – yet the damage caused due to chronic condition is more – and therefore, surgery becomes necessary to repair the damage.
What is the Cure for sinus infection or Best Cure for sinusitis?
Chronic sinusitis treatment: If a person has a sinus infection and is presented with three to four symptoms of sinusitis, he or she must see the best doctor for sinusitis
The treatment for bacterial sinusitis involves sinus medication, i.e., antibiotics therapy. If the sinusitis becomes persistent & prolong, then the best cure for sinusitis is intensive antibiotic therapy; and therefore, your doctor may prescribe sinus medication to treat bacterial sinusitis or chronic sinusitis. Surgery may sometimes become necessary to remove physical obstructions that may contribute to sinusitis.
Is surgery required for sinusitis?
Surgery may become absolutely indispensable if antibiotic therapy for sinusitis fails owing to a nasal obstruction that cannot be removed by using medicines. The best sinus specialist doctor in Hyderabad will select an appropriate surgical procedure by considering the unique requirement of the patient and their condition.
Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) is one such procedure, which is recommended by an ENT specialist to treat a certain type of sinus condition. In this type of surgical technique, the surgeon directs an endoscope into the nose along with other instruments and removes diseased tissues and polyps to clean the narrow channels of the sinuses. The surgeon may use local or general anaesthetic depending on the condition of the patient and their individual preferences.
If surgery has been suggested to you by your surgeon, then ensure that you have realistic expectations about the course of the treatment – the possible outcomes, post-operative care, recovery and health. Good outcomes are possible with good understanding between the patient and his or her surgeon and cooperative efforts between them and also when the patient follows the pre and post-operative instructions of the surgeon diligently.

The system can also notify you about sensitive rule violation incidents that need your personal attention.
Boost Employee Productivity and Increase Organisational Performance
Use the workforce productivity tools to track active vs inactive time, late shifts, long breaks, etc. Use intelligent activity-based rules to automatically identify clues to customer dissatisfaction (angry sentiments in social media posts/customer query in instant messenger not answered etc.) and implement processes to provide better service.
Monitor Privileged Users for Extra Security
Teramind allows organisations to create profiles for remote and privileged employees and then define what information and system resources each profile can access. Create autonomous rules to notify the authorities of any suspicious privileged user activity, such as unscheduled login, access to system configuration, creation of backdoor accounts, etc.
Audit Security Incidents with Forensics
Detailed alerts for all users can be viewed including any security event and what action was taken, which app/site was involved, what data got accesses etc. Session recordings and history playback can be used to view user’s desktop or exported as MP4 video to be used as evidence in any investigation. Immutable system logs and session reports provide with further information to trace back to the source and cause of any security incident.

What features does the system offer to monitor and restrict risky activities of employees and privileged users
------------correct----------------------
ttachments from an unknown website, running a risky application etc. Then, apply behaviour-based rules to detect when users violate the rules. The system will automatically block harmful employee activity or warn the user with a customised message about potential danger reducing false positives with minimal supervision. The system can also notify you about sensitive rule violation incidents that need your personal attention.
Boost Employee Productivity and Increase Organisational Performance
Use the workforce productivity tools to track active vs inactive time, late shifts, long breaks, etc. Use intelligent activity-based rules to automatically identify clues to customer dissatisfaction (angry sentiments in social media posts/customer query in instant messenger not answered etc.) and implement processes to provide better service.
Monitor Privileged Users for Extra Security
Teramind allows organisations to create profiles for remote and privileged employees and then define what information and system resources each profile can access. Create autonomous rules to notify the authorities of any suspicious privileged user activity, such as unscheduled login, access to system configuration, creation of backdoor accounts, etc.
Audit Security Incidents with Forensics
Detailed alerts for all users can be viewed including any security event and what action was taken, which app/site was involved, what data got accesses etc. Session recordings and history playback can be used to view user’s desktop or exported as MP4 video to be used as evidence in any investigation. Immutable system logs and session reports provide with further information to trace back to the source and cause of any security incident.

Greece expects bondholders to accept a one-time offer to write off about 100 billion euros ($140 billion) of Greek debt and is ready to force them to participate if necessary, Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said.
“This is the best offer,” Venizelos said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Nicole Itano in Athens today. “This is the best offer because this is the only one, the only existing offer.”
The Greek government has set a 75 percent participation rate as a threshold for proceeding with the transaction, in which investors will forgive 53.5 percent of their principal and exchange their remaining holdings for new Greek government bonds and notes from the European Financial Stability Facility.
The private investors that declared their participation in Greece’s debt restructuring hold about 20 percent of the bonds involved in a swap required for an international bailout. The 12 members of the creditors’ steering committee that said today they would join in the exchange have debt with a face value of about 40 billion euros ($53 billion).
The yen climbed 0.3 percent against the euro and advanced 0.5 percent versus the dollar. The euro strengthened 0.2 percent to $1.3224 as it appreciated against 13 of 16 major peers.
The S&P GSCI gauge of commodities was little changed as 18 of 24 materials retreated, overshadowing gains in cotton, corn and heating oil. Cotton jumped the daily maximum allowed of 4 cents a pound, or 4.5 percent, after India halted exports. India is the second-biggest exporter after the U.S.
Speculators increased bets on higher agricultural prices to a five-month high on mounting concern that a South American drought will curb supplies of soybeans, corn and sugar at a time of record global demand. A measure of speculative positions across 11 farm goods jumped 26 percent to 607,721 futures and options in the week ended Feb. 28, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.
China may “appropriately” widen the yuan’s trading band to better reflect market supply and demand, Xinhua News Agency reported, citing People’s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan. Zhou said the yuan has gradually met the requirements to become more of a floating currency, Xinhua reported. As China improves its industrial structure and gradually reduces its trade surplus, the yuan is now moving “very close” to a “balanced level,” Xinhua reported in English, citing Zhou.
In today’s trading, the yuan declined to its weakest level in almost a month. The central bank weakened the currency’s daily fixing by 0.22 percent, setting it at 6.3121 per dollar.
The Taiex index retreated 1.4 percent after Taiwanese technology companies reported slumping sales. The BSE India Sensitive Index fell 1.6 percent before the results of state elections tomorrow that may be crucial in determining the future of the ruling Congress Party’s economic agenda.

What are the benefits and effects of Fragonia Essential Oil mentioned in the text
------------correct----------------------
n cases of bacterial tonsillitis.
It is said to be antimicrobial, as well as helpful with candida. It is also said to be a powerful anti-inflammatory, and a pain reliever, especially helpful with the pain associated with arthritis, as well as muscle and joint pain. Dr. Penoel strongly recommends it for all respiratory disorders, whether in sinus areas or in the lungs. It is also said to stimulate and enhance the immune system.
However this new oil seems to have amazingly strong emotional effects, having a deep action on the psyche. There are case studies of people with longstanding emotional blockages who were able to find release. The essential oil seems to both release tension and have a relaxing/calming effect on the mind. Dr. Peneol says that the use of Fragonia at bedtime will improve the depth and the relaxing effects of sleep.
Several writers have mentioned Fragonia Essential Oil’s effect of bringing peace and inner harmony to those using it.
Robbi Zeck has written this reflection on Fragonia in The Blossoming Heart.
I write this review on the day we received our shipment. I’ve sampled the oil, but not had time to experiment with it. But tonight it will be Fragonia in the Aroma Stone beside my bed.
(Months later) At first Christi was much more enthusiastic about this new oil than I was. However, when she created her Relax Synergy, that became an immediate favorite of mine, and using it lead to my growing appreciation for the balancing and respiratory effects of Fragonia. My grandson has found that it seems to ease his chronic asthma. Not a replacement for a rescue inhaler, but used (by inhalation) on a daily basis it seems to reduce his need for the rescue inhaler. It is a key ingredient in our Deep Breath blend.
Safety: Robert Tisserand advises that: no warnings except oxidization

How do cyber security professionals work in the real world?
so far we discussed basic approaches and some relevant information, however, we have not really dived into how cyber security operates in companies and the government.
Let’s examine before computers were invented how countries protected their borders or identified threats coming from internal parts of the country, the security fundamentally is of two types one is defensive and the other one is offensive.
What is an offensive method, here we target the enemy before he attacks us, or do we attack the enemy while he is coming to us to attack?
The defensive method means we protect our borders with lots of fencing and soldiers, in the cyber world you use firewalls, proxies, and honeypots as fencing tools.
Here is a video to watch about offensive and defensive security
Offensive security is, Legally doing the following.
Before you watch this video, understand about cyber attack kill chain
Next, we will discuss defensive security
More on Defensive security
Defensive security essentially monitors the network with various sensors which collect the logs generated by various devices in the network, this includes your windows workstations, servers, domain co

Jean-Baptiste Belin de Fontenay I (1653–1715), also called ‘Jean-Baptiste Belin the Elder’, was a French painter who specialized in flowers. He was born in Caen, France in 1653 and died in Paris in 1715. Early in life he was forced to choose between his Protestant religion and his career.

What is the aim of the London String Collective founded by Abigail Dance and her colleagues
------------correct----------------------
London-based string players aim to make the TV and live session scene less about appearance and more reflective of the diversity of musical talent
A new collective of London-based string players aims to make the TV and live session scene less about looks and more reflective of the depth and diversity of musical talent in the city. ‘We value substance and style,’ said violinist and violist Abigail Dance, co-founder of the London String Collective.
Dance (pictured, centre, with fellow members of the collective) was first inspired to set up a group after some of her students complained that they would never get to play the violin with their favourite performers on TV because ‘the people playing on TV didn’t look like them’. Her conviction was strengthened when, along with some string-playing friends, ?she was approached for work, ‘but instead ?of the agents wanting evidence of how well we could play, they sent through what amounted to a model

What are some key features of the author's work-appropriate outfit
------------correct----------------------
its for work!
It's definitely a business casual outfit since I am just working at a desk most of the time or facilitating events and I don't have to be extremely professionally dressed. But it's comfy and cute so what more can you ask for!?
Have any of you used one or used a similar product that you would recommend??
Gray Button Down - original from Hollister Co. - similar - $10
Sparkle Tank - Original from Maurices - Similar - $19.20
Olive Pants - Zara - Similar - $39.90
These pants are the most comfortable jeans that I own. I want to get them in all the possible colors! Definitely worth the investment!
Shoes - Toms - Similar - $79.00
Rings - Forever 21
This is a comfortable outfit and very versatile! I'd love to see your spin on it!
I'm so glad to be back even if it was a brief post!

What types of attacks can be detected by monitoring network firewall logs in a security operations center (SOC)
------------correct----------------------
ntrollers, network devices like switches, routers, firewalls, and other critical infrastructure devices, this is a complex subject and there is a whole industry running on it which produces different products like SIEM ( Security information and event management) like IBM Qradar, Splunk, ArcSight, and various others, Endpoint security products like carbon black, sentinel, McAfee, Symantec, and various others…
often these tools correlate the collected data and generate security intelligence for the soc ( security operations center), which processes and eliminates further the noise and produces the final output, this output can lead to detecting an attack and then the security team takes action with the help of infrastructure teams.
Let’s dive into one example scenario, for example, you are monitoring the Network firewall logs collected into a SIEM or another tool, and now your job is to detect attacks happening from external to internal, what kind of attacks you can detect? here below the list
Port scanning: means somebody from external trying to see what ports are open on your network which are available to connect from external sources.
Access control enumeration
IP spoofing attacks
DOS and DDOS attacks.

What is the purpose of the eRedbook app and who endorsed it
------------correct----------------------
ate company based in London, was seeking closer ties to the NHS in September.
In January, it was announced that Babylon would be developing a NHS 111 triage app in partnership with North Central London CCGs.
Patients Know Best, a personal patient-controlled health record app, is already widely used in the NHS, although often with specific cohorts of patients.
Lloyd Humphreys, the company’s vice president of business development, said it had yet to be confirmed that company would be part of app library.
“But PKB is delighted to be involved in any NHS Digital or NHS England programme, including the app library.”
The eRedbook, an electronic version of the “red book” given to UK parent to record their child’s health, has been in development for two years and will be rolled out across London from April. It is the only digital children health record to be endorsed by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, having passed clinical assurance and standards.
Daniel Moulin, eRedbook director, said he had done some workshops with NHS Digital about “dovetailing into its work stream” but the app had also not yet been formally approved.
The apps form part of broader push from NHS Digital and NHS England to get more people managing and engaging with their health online, as outlined in the Personalised Health and Care 2020 framework.
However, digital patient-facing services have been promised before, only to be quietly dropped. NHS Choices was once touted to include many of features now promised for NHS.uk, such as a personal health record.
An NHS app library, now rebranded digital tool library to cover wearables, has also previously been attempted.
That store closed in October 2015, after a study found many of the apps did not adequately protect patient data.
NHS digital leaders will be hoping a more rigorous “four-stage endorsement” model will help improve the quality and security of apps this time round.

Stocks Fall as China Reduces Growth Target; Yen Gains, Treasuries Retreat
Stocks (MXWD) fell for a second day after China announced the lowest economic growth target since 2004 and European services and manufacturing output was less than earlier estimated. The yen climbed, while Treasuries declined.
The S&P 500 lost 0.4 percent to close at 1,364.33 at 4 p.m. in New York and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 14.76 points to 12,962.81. The yen strengthened against all 16 most- traded peers, while China weakened its currency’s daily fixing by the most since November 2010 and said it may widen its trading band. Oil was little changed, while copper slid 1.1 percent and natural gas fell 5.2 percent. Ten-year Treasury yields rose three basis points to 2.005 percent.
China cut the nation’s economic growth target to 7.5 percent from an 8 percent goal in place since 2005, according to Premier Wen Jiabao’s speech at the National People’s Congress today. European services and manufacturing output shrank in February more than earlier estimated, Markit Economics said, and U.S. factory orders fell for the first time in three months. Greece’s private creditors decide this week whether to sign off on the country’s debt restructuring.
“It’s just not an environment that we feel like sticking our neck out to take on a lot of risk,” Michael Mullaney, who helps manage $9.5 billion at Fiduciary Trust in Boston, said in a telephone interview. “We’ve been scratching our heads a little bit after the big run-up in equities. We just don’t see a strong enough global economic background to support where prices are right now.”
Retreat From High
The S&P 500 (SPX) fell for a second day after last week reaching its highest level since 2008. Equities briefly pared losses after the Institute for Supply Management’s index of non- manufacturing industries rose to 57.3 in February, topping the median economist projection for a decline to 56. Commerce Department data showed orders to U.S. factories decreased in January by 1 percent, less than the median prediction for a 1.5 percent drop.
Alcoa Inc., Caterpillar Inc. and Bank of America Corp. lost at least 2 percent to lead declines in the Dow. Zynga Inc. (ZNGA), the online-game company that sold shares to the public in December, and CF Industries Holdings Inc., North America’s largest maker of nitrogen-based fertilizer , tumbled at least 2.9 percent after the companies were downgraded.
Corporate profits that doubled since 2009 have left the S&P 500 cheaper than at all 34 peaks since 1989, even as options traders push the cost of protecting against losses to the highest in four years relative to the cost of betting on gains.
Companies in the benchmark gauge of U.S. stocks (MXWD) trade for 14 times earnings after advancing 102 percent since March 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg that excludes peaks occurring within a month of one another. Valuations are lower than at every 52-week peak since 1989. Traders have pushed the price of contracts that pay should the S&P 500 drop 20 percent to the most since 2007 compared with ones betting on a rally of the same size.
Technology and consumer-discretionary stocks, which have led this year’s rally in the S&P 500 along with financials, may perform worse than other shares as American economic reports struggle to beat rising forecasts, according to Tobias Levkovich, chief U.S. equity strategist at Citigroup Inc.
A drop in Citigroup’s Economic Surprise Index (CESIUSD) for the U.S. is one of several concerns for the market in the short-term, Levkovich said. The index, which measures the extent to which reports beat or miss forecasts, has fallen to 48.2 from 83.70 on Feb. 3. Consumer-discretionary and technology shares show some of the highest correlations to the gauge and “are vulnerable to a pullback,” the report said.
‘Dr. Fed;’ ‘Monetary Morphine’
Two-year Treasury yields increased two basis points to 0.30 percent and 30-year rates added four basis points to 3.15 percent today. Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher said he opposes additional Fed purchases of securities and urged Wall Street to get ready to become less dependent on monetary easing.
“I would suggest to you that, if the data continue to improve, however gradually, the markets should begin preparing themselves for the good Dr. Fed to wean them from their dependency rather than administer further dosage,” Fisher said today in the text of a speech in Dallas.

For the past 15 years, writing instructor Zoe Mullery has spent each Wednesday night in a small, crowded room listening to and commenting on stories written by San Quentin inmates.
The inmates, called Brothers in Pen, produce a variety of works, including memoirs, science fiction, short stories and urban novels.
“There’s something that happens in this room that’s dear to me,” Mullery says of her weekly workshops.
On one recent Wednesday, Annie Rovzar, a University of San Francisco (USF) creative writing instructor, and her students joined the Brothers in Pen.
Rovzar said when she discovered Mullery’s workshop she thought an interaction between her students and Brothers in Pen would be constructive.
Alexandra, a USF student, said when she heard about the prison’s writing workshop, she “wanted to come here and share with you guys.” Alexandra, a communications major, explained, “I took creative writing because it’s something I like doing.”
“Hopefully we can learn something from you, and you can learn something from us,” said inmate James Metters, who has been in Mullery’s workshop for about a year and a half.
Shira Steinberg took the USF creative writing class because she says, “It’s the one place I can be honest,” adding that she wants to become a child sociologist.
The students and inmates took turns reading their work, with all the participants commenting. The back and forth continued until everyone had read.
The USF students read pieces from a class assignment that required them to reflect on a significant memory.
USF student Paul read “My First Car Accident,” a childhood memory about being the victim of a hit-and-run driver. He wrote, “I remember the air being still that day. I heard the sudden drift of the tires.” His vivid recall of the event left the class asking if he fully recovered physically from the accident. He said, “Yes, I even play basketball now.”
Mitchell Fryer has been in Mullery’s Creative Writing Workshop for about six months. He read “Some People,” a poem about self-identification through comparing and contrasting life from his perspective. Fryer also read “What Would It Take,” about the trials and tribulations of living a hard life.
USF student Shelby Black read “Well Child,” a poem that reflects how she sees life. It instructs readers not to take life too seriously, keep a level head and live freely. “Buy shoes you’ll never wear, and stop texting me and talk to me.” Black is a journalism student and writes for The Foghorn, the college newspaper.
Ron “Coach” Koehler read two poems. “Fear,” which is reminiscent of Franz Kafka’s obscure tension between man and the state, as one line read: “science has disappeared into fiction.” He also read a piece that connected pre-prison lif

What are the steps mentioned for identifying and addressing weaknesses in team members
------------correct----------------------
It’s important to identify and address weaknesses in individuals in order to build a strong, cohesive team that can succeed.
Recognizing individual strengths and weaknesses within a team helps to create balance, ultimately leading to a great, successful team. As a manager leading a team of nine, I have learned how to identify weaknesses within my team members and address them in order to build a strong, cohesive team. There are several steps you can take to identify and address weaknesses to hopefully turn them into strengths over time.
Step 1: When bringing on new team members, I generally start by managing and training them in the same manner, then modify the training as we move forward based upon my observations of the individual’s strengths and challenges. Each person learns differently, and it is important to adapt one’s management approach in order to support the individual’s success.
Step 2: Identify the individual’s weakness, and be specific. In the recruiting industry, these challenges may range from business development to technical understanding of the specific industry in which we work. In general, some of the more common weaknesses that can show up in otherwise strong team members can be anything from lack of follow up to a team member who gets bogged down in the mundane tasks rather than dedicating the time to the strategic items on their his or her to do list. Whatever the weaknesses of the people you manage may be, understanding them and developing a strategy for overcoming them is key to combating these issues.
Step 3: Address the weakness. In a constructive manner, sit down with the individual and discuss your observation of the challenge. Talk through the area in which he or she needs to improve. Provide mentoring on how to further develop work-arounds to ensure these weaknesses do not inhibit their day to day work, and a specific action plan he or she can follow order to further develop and eventually overcome these areas they may be falling short. Also, leverage their particular strengths to compensate

What names did Peggy Pylant use in various documents and what connection does she have to the War of 1812
------------correct----------------------
I feel like I am trying to put together a puzzle that has just one missing piece. Do you have the missing piece or know where I can find it?
My fifth great-grandmother was named Margaret but went by Peggy. She was born March 7, 1801 to unknown parents – that’s the problem. She was born in Cumberland County, North Carolina.
At the age of 19, on October 20, 1820, she married Pinkney Lee Pylant in Cumberland County, North Carolina. She used the name Pagey (Peggy) Gilbert on the marriage document. However, this isn’t case closed for her last name. Type in a Google search or check out ancestry.com if you’d like to become VERY confused. At some unknown point, it was suggested her last name was really Renfrow.
I am tired of calling her Margaret Peggy Gilbert Renfrow or Margaret Peggy Renfrow Gilbert…can we just drop one name? In frustration, I decided to do research to compile how this confusion got started in the first place.
I first examined her later years for clues. Pinkney and Peggy settled in Lincoln County, Tennessee on Norris Creek near Belleville. She’s there on the 1850, 1860, 1870 and 1880 census records. In 1870 and 1880, she’s living with her son Felix and his family. (In 1880, Felix’s name was wrongly transcribed as Thos. All census records mentioned are pulled from Ancestry.)
Here are their known children:
William Pylant 1820–1866
Gabriel Pylant 1821–1905
Green Allen Pylant 1823–1905
Penina Pylant 1825–1907
Gray Pylant 1828–
Harry Jackson Pylant 1828–1880
John Lee Pylant 1830–1896
Margaret Ann Pylant 1832–1860
James Crawford Pylant 1835–1908
William Gilford Pylant 1837–1919
Francis Marion Pylant 1840–1864
Felix Grundy Pylant 1842–1922
Her husband Pinkney died in 1861, and Peggy applied for a widow’s pension for Pinkney’s service during the War of 1812. Transcribed below.
Application # 30066
State of Tennessee County of Lincoln
On this second day of August A.D. eighteen hundred and seventy-eight personally appeared before me, Paul D. Boyce, Clerk of the County Court, a Court of Record in and for the County and State aforesaid, Margaret Pylant aged seventy-seven years, a resident of Norris Creek, County of Lincoln, State of Tennessee, who being duly sworn according to law, declares that she is the widow of Pinkney Pylant who served the full period of fourteen days in the military service of the United States in the War of 1812, and who was the identical Pinkney Pylant who enlisted in Captain John Green’s Company, North Carolina Militia at Raleigh, North Carolina in 1814, and was honorably discharged at Norfolk, Virginia in 1815; that he served in said Company as a Private the last five or six months of the war. The precise date of enlistment and discharge not remembered, nor can the applicant designate the Regiment, Brigade & Division of the Army; that she married under the name of Peggy Gilbert to said Pinkney Pylant on the twelvth day of September A.D. 1820 by John Burch, a Justice of the Peace of Cumberland Co., N.C. in said Co., there being no legal barrier to such marriage; that her said husband died at Norris Creek, Lincoln Co., Tenn. on the twenty-first day of September 1861 and that she has not remarried since his death; that she is not in receipt of a pension under any previous act; that she makes this declaration for the purpose of being placed on the pension rolls of the United States, under the provision of the act approved March 9, 1878, and hereby constitutes and appoints, with full power of substitution and revocation, Holman & Holman, of Fayetteville, Tennessee, her true and lawful attorneys to prosecute her claim, and obtain the pension certificate that may be issued; that her post-office is at Norris Creek, County of Lincoln, State of Tennessee; that her domicile or place of abode is Norris Creek, Lincoln County, Tennessee.
Peggy Pylant, applicant
Attest: Isham Sorrells, Jas. F. Renfrow
Rejected Feb. 21st, 1879 on the ground that there is no record evidence of the service of the organization in which individual service is alleged in the War of 1812.
This document is important because we have the name of her two witnesses. Isham Sorrells married her daughter Penina, so he would be her son-in-law. The other was James F. Renfrow.
James Renfrow attended church with the Pylant family at Mt. Hebron Presbyterian Church. (Here is a website that transcribes the church’s records.) James was born about 1815, so he was about 14 years younger than Peggy.
I researched James and found that he was also born in Cumberland County, North Carolina. Hang on, because this is where this REALLY gets confusing.
James Renfrow’s mother was named Edith Swindle / Swindell (married name). She lived with James until her death in 1868. You can find her on the 1850 and 1860 census in his home. She was also a member of the Mt. Hebron Presbyterian Church. AND guess where she’s buried? In the Pylant Cemetery beside Peggy & Pinkney Pylant! That may not seem so odd at first, but it’s a small cemetery with only Pylants (9 to be exact) buried there. Here’s a link to the list of graves.
In my investigation of Edith, I found that she was born February 3, 1782 in North Carolina. Her first marriage was to a James GILBERT. We know

e with his current prison life.
USF student, Kevin read “World Pool.” Kevin’s words brought to mind the simple act of making tea, e.g., a steaming pot and swirling leaves. However, the words transformed the tea making process into a human character being swirled into a hypnotic, drug-like state.
“World Pool” took me to an unexpected place in literature,” an inmate said.
Inmate Paul Stauffer read a poem “Hollywood Dream.” His words, “Worshiping themselves who never was,” point out the falsity and sham in the lives of Los Angeles socialites.
Steinberg wrote about her days of overcoming panic attacks through “I Remember.” The inmates were visibly moved as they listened to her internal struggle and pain. “I felt really empowered to continue writing. The Brothers in Pen were very supportive, so it made me realize that you are never alone, even if you think you are.”
Jasmine read “First Memory,” recalling what fear looks like for a child. The piece focused on overcoming pain and getting back to the state of childhood innocence. In her fear, she wrote, “I remember trying to make myself as small as possible. I remember feeling confused. I remember starting the next morning like nothing had happened.”
After listening to the USF students, Rahsaan Thomas said, “What I’ve learned from hearing your stories is that inmates are not solely subjected to painful lives. Pain is universal.”
USF student Spencer read “I Remember You,” which was about his struggle with alcoholism. He stressed the importance of getting to step one. He wrote, “I found a conscious reason not to relapse and get back on track.”
One USF student read “Treasure,” a poem about self-imagery that advocates taking great pride in yourself by seeing yourself as a treasure. Another USF student read a poem that critically examined a consumer-based economy. “House of Hell” takes a walk in the city, recognizing the power of capitalism through consumption.
Inmate Justin “Clown” Medvin ended the event by reading “The Rose that Grew from Ash,” an expressive poem asserting life could be built from ruins.
“Coming to prison for the first time was a bit intimidating, said Gabe Nikias. “I emerged with a significantly changed perspective, making the seemingly obvious observation that even ‘criminals’ are pretty normal folks at heart.”
“No matter who you are, what you’ve seen or where you’re from, we all long to be recognized, appreciated and loved,” said USF student Elizabeth M. “I could tell it was a safe space for the Brothers in Pen to share their work and tell their stories.”
Rovzar and her colleague, Stephen Novotny, began a poetry workshop at San Quentin.
The Emergency for Emerging Forms of Life meets every Sunday from 5:30 to 8 p.m, May 4 through June 22.

rather be doing something else. Like, surfing FaceBook.
- I got a new Blackberry. I think I am going to like it, except I don't know how to use it, and I type very slow. I can, however, access FaceBook at work now,
which is probably not a good thing.

:2008 certification examined every aspect of Oman Air's airport lounge management systems, ensuring that they are robust, adaptable and applicable to all areas of the lounges' operations.
The award of certification to Oman Air's lounges at Muscat International Airport follows the recent ISO certification of the airline's supply chain management and is the latest step in Oman Air's programme of ensuring the highest possible quality in all aspects of its business.
Richard Hodges concluded:
"Oman Air is a luxury carrier and quality lies at the heart of everything we do. The First Class and Business Class lounges at Muscat are an excellent example of this – we offer outstanding hospitality within a relaxing environment which is perfect for preparing for your flight. Whether you choose the full à la carte dining experience or just a light snack, our menus will get your taste buds tingling, and our complimentary massages will ease away any tensions. The décor is elegant and refined, the atmosphere is soothing and services such as our First Class lounge-to-aircraft limousines underline the exclusivity that our guests enjoy. Ensuring that all this works perfectly requires excellent management systems and I would like to congratulate all the staff who have contributed to the achievement of this ISO 9001:2008 certification.

its for work!
It's definitely a business casual outfit since I am just working at a desk most of the time or facilitating events and I don't have to be extremely professionally dressed. But it's comfy and cute so what more can you ask for!?
Have any of you used one or used a similar product that you would recommend??
Gray Button Down - original from Hollister Co. - similar - $10
Sparkle Tank - Original from Maurices - Similar - $19.20
Olive Pants - Zara - Similar - $39.90
These pants are the most comfortable jeans that I own. I want to get them in all the possible colors! Definitely worth the investment!
Shoes - Toms - Similar - $79.00
Rings - Forever 21
This is a comfortable outfit and very versatile! I'd love to see your spin on it!
I'm so glad to be back even if it was a brief post!
