What is the main challenge Rebecca faces after gaining immortality from Miss Hatfield
------------correct----------------------
In what is fast becoming the Book Flood of Summer 2014, even more exciting books have been turning up in the post and as eARCs…
Featuring: Anna Caltabiano, Orson Scott Card & Aaron Johnston, Richard A. Clarke, James S.A. Corey, Ellen Datlow (ed.), Emma Donohue, Daryl Gregory, Elliott Hall, Doug Hulick, Kameron Hurley, Kendra Leighton, D.J. Molles, Edward St. Aubyns, Liesel Schwarz, Graeme Shimmin, Nalini Singh, James Thornton
Rebecca, a 15-year-old American, isn’t entirely happy with her life, comfortable though it is. Still, even she knows that she shouldn’t talk to strangers. So when her mysterious neighbour Miss Hatfield asked her in for a chat and a drink, Rebecca wasn’t entirely sure why she said yes. It was a decision that was to change everything.
For Miss Hatfield is immortal. And now, thanks to a drop of water from the Fountain of Youth, Rebecca is as well. But this gift might be more of a curse, and it comes with a price. Rebecca is beginning to lose her personality, to take on the aspects of her neighbour. She is becoming the next Miss Hatfield.
But before the process goes too far, Rebecca must travel back in time to turn-of-the-century New York and steal a painting, a picture which might provide a clue to the whereabouts of the source of immortality. A clue which must remain hidden from the world. In order to retrieve the painting, Rebecca must infiltrate a wealthy household, learn more about the head of the family, and find an opportunity to escape. Before her journey is through, she will also have – rather reluctantly – fallen in love. But how can she stay with the boy she cares for, when she must return to her own time before her time-travelling has a fatal effect on her body? And would she rather stay and die in love, or leave and live alone?
And who is the mysterious stranger who shadows her from place to place? A hunter for the secret of immortality – or someone who has already found it?
One of Gollancz’s 2014 debuts, I was very much looking forward to reading this. I’m reading it at the moment and, while interesting and pretty well done, it isn’t really grabbing me… Hopefully it will pick up as I near the end…
Nearly 100 years before the events of Orson Scott Card’s bestselling novel Ender’s Game, humans were just beginning to step off Earth and out into the Solar System. A thin web of ships in both asteroid belts; a few stations; a corporate settlement on Luna. No one had seen any sign of other space-faring races; everyone expected that First Contact, if it came, would happen in the future, in the empty reaches between the stars. Then a young navigator on a distant mining ship saw something moving too fast, heading directly for our sun.
When the alien ship screamed through the solar system, it disrupted communications between the far-flung human mining ships and supply stations, and between them and Earth. So Earth and Luna were unaware that they had been invaded until the ship pulled into Earth orbit, and began landing terra-forming crews in China. Politics and pride slowed the response on Earth, and on Luna, corporate power struggles seemed more urgent than distant deaths. But there are a few men and women who see that if Earth doesn’t wake up and pull together, the planet could be lost.
This is the third volume in Card & Johnston’s The First Formic War series. Sadly, I haven’t read any of the Ender’s Game-related novels, so I’m not sure I’ll get to this in the immediate future. I will, however, be reading Ender’s Game pretty soon.
In Washington, the Kill Committee gathers in the White House’s Situation Room to pick the next targets for the United States drone program. At an airbase just outside Las Vegas, a team of pilots, military personnel and intelligence officers follow through on the committee's orders, finding the men who have been deemed a threat to national security and sentenced to death. On the other side of the world, in the mountains where the drones hunt their prey, someone has decided to fight back. And not just against the unmanned planes that circle their skies, but against the Americans at home who control them.
I’ve read a fair bit of Clarke’s non-fiction, so I’m curious to see what his fiction is like. Hot topic, drones.
The gates have opened the way to thousands of habitable planets, and the land rush has begun. Settlers stream out from humanity's home planets in a vast, poorly controlled flood, landing on a new world. Among them, the Rocinante, haunted by the vast, posthuman network of the protomolecule as they investigate what destroyed the great intergalactic society that built the gates and the protomolecule.
But Holden and his crew must also contend with the growing tensions between the settlers and the company which owns the official claim to the planet. Both sides will stop at nothing to defend what's theirs, but soon a terrible disease strikes and only Holden – with help from the ghostly Detective Miller – can find the cure.
I’m so behind on this series… This is the fourth novel in The Expanse series, yet I’ve only managed to read the first one, Leviathan Wakes. It was recently announced that the TV rights for the series have been bought and (possibly) started development. I’d like to catch up, and I’ll do my best to do so.
This deliciously creepy and loving tribute to the master of modern horror features riveting illustrated stories of his wicked progeny.
In the century since the master of horror, H. P. Lovecraft, published his first story, the monstrosities that crawled out of his brain have become legend: the massive, tentacled Cthulhu, who lurks beneath the sea waiting for his moment to rise; the demon Sultan Azathoth, who lies babbling at the center of the universe, mad beyond imagining; the Deep Ones, who come to shore to breed with mortal men; and the unspeakably-evil Hastur, whose very name brings death. These creatures have been the nightmarish fuel for generations of horror writers, and the inspiration for some of their greatest works.
This impressive anthology celebrates Lovecraft's most famous beasts in all their grotesque glory, with each story a gripping new take on a classic mythos creature and affectionately accompanied by an illuminating illustration. Within these accursed pages something unnatural slouches from the sea into an all-night diner to meet the foolish young woman waiting for him, while the Hounds of Tindalos struggle to survive trapped in human bodies, haunting pool halls for men they can lure into the dark. Strange, haunting, and undeniably monstrous, this is Lovecraft as you have never seen him before.
Sounds like an interesting anthology.
Summer of 1876: San Francisco is in the fierce grip of a record-breaking heat wave and a smallpox epidemic. Through the window of a railroad saloon, a young woman called Jenny Bonnet is shot dead. The survivor, her friend Blanche Beunon, is a French burlesque dancer. Over the next three days, she will risk everything to bring Jenny's murderer to justice – if he doesn’t track her down first. The story Blanche struggles to piece together is one of free-love bohemians, desperate paupers and arrogant millionaires; of jealous men, icy women and damaged children. It’s the secret life of Jenny herself, a notorious character who breaks the law every morning by getting dressed: a charmer as slippery as the frogs she hunts.
In thrilling, cinematic style, FROG MUSIC digs up a long-forgotten, never-solved crime. Full of songs that migrated across the world, Emma Donoghue's lyrical tale of love and bloodshed among lowlifes captures the pulse of a boom town like no other.
Some of my own research touched upon Chinese immigration into San Francisco during this period, so I thought the novel sounded quite interesting.
Harrison was the Monster Detective, a storybook hero. Now he’s in his mid-thirties, and spends most of his time popping pills and not sleeping. Stan became a minor celebrity after being partially eaten by cannibals. Barbara is haunted

Who are you? What is your identity? If our identity is found in our jobs, feelings, desires, accomplishments, or relationships, then our identity won’t be stable and it can be crushed. But our identity can be found in one who never fails. Jesus takes sinful people, losers and failures, and turns them into his people. Find out why Jesus gives us great hope. Pastor Brian Watson preaches this message based on Luke 5:1-11.
Who do you think you are?
That’s an important question. I don’t mean, what are you? The question of what human beings are is an important one, to be sure. But I have something far more personal in mind. Who are you? What is your identity?
The question of identity is an important one. It concerns how we think of ourselves and how we think of others. Think about what happens when you meet someone new. You start to identify that person by categories. We think of what a person looks like, his or her gender and age and looks, how that person is dressed, how they speak and act, and so on. When we get to know people, we often ask, “What do you do?” We mean, “What do you do for work?” or, “What do you do for a living?” That’s another way of identifying someone. We may ask, “Where are you from?” That, too, is a way of placing that person in a certain category.
The question of identity has also come front-and-center in many important political and cultural debates. The term “identity politics” addresses the issue of how people’s identity affects their politics. As far as I can tell, this began as an attempt to organize minority voices, which isn’t a bad thing at all. If, say, people who have a certain skin color and/or ethnicity aren’t getting their voices heard in the public square, it’s good for them to band together and make their views known. But what has happened is that now we pigeonhole people according to gender, skin color, religion, and sexual orientation, among other things. Instead of evaluating people according “to the content of their character,” as Martin Luther King put it, we assume that if people are white male Christians, they must think this way, or can’t possibly have anything to say to that issue. It seems that instead of getting less prejudiced, we’re getting more prejudiced, putting everyone into camps before we even know what each person is really like.
Today, many people identify themselves according to their desires, and this creates new classes of people. People who are transgender have a biological sex, yet they self-identify as having a different gender, the one usually associated with the opposite sex. So, a transgender man is a biological woman who feels that she is a man. People who are gay, lesbian, or bisexual identify themselves according to sexual desires. These identities are not rooted in biology, but only in desire. Imagine if you self-identified according to other dispositions, like pride, anger, lust, jealousy, and covetousness.
Our identities can also be based around our accomplishments or failures. We can find our self-worth in our jobs, our awards, our degrees, the amount of money we’ve made, or the way that people view us. Or, we can think of all the jobs we’ve lost, the awards we failed to earn, the degrees we never earned, the money we’ve lost, and the relationships we’ve lost.
What is your identity? Is it based on what you do for a living? Your political views? Your ethnicity? Your looks? Your desires? Your achievements? Your failures? When you think of yourself, what comes to mind? Who are you?
I ask this question because today we’re going to look at a passage of the Gospel of Luke that deals with identity. We’ve been studying this biography of Jesus for about three months, and we’ve seen that Jesus has recently begun his public ministry. He has preached a message of God’s kingdom and he has healed people. Now, he gathers some coworkers to himself. The story is rather simple: Jesus calls Simon Peter and a couple of associates to be his followers. They were fishermen, but Jesus gives them a new vocation: instead of catching fish, they will now catch people. (Don’t take that literally—I’ll explain what that means in a bit.) At the heart of this story is identity. Peter saw himself as a humble fisherman and, besides that, a sinful man. Yet Jesus summons Peter to take on a new identity. We might read this story as just a bit of religious history, but it’s much more than that. Jesus is still in the habit of calling sinful people to himself, giving them new identities and new roles to play.
So, with that in mind, let’s read Luke 5:1–11:
1 On one occasion, while the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the word of God, he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret, 2 and he saw two boats by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets. 3 Getting into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, he asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the people from the boat. 4 And when he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.” 5 And Simon answered, “Master, we toiled all night and took nothing! But at your word I will let down the nets.” 6 And when they had done this, they enclosed a large number of fish, and their nets were breaking. 7 They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink. 8 But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.” 9 For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish that they had taken, 10 and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, “Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching men.” 11 And when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed him.
As I said, the story is fairly simple, but I’ll give us a few details to explain. Jesus is at the “lake of Gennesaret,” which is another name for the Sea of Galilee. Jesus had been gaining a following, so there were people there who wanted “to hear the word of God.” Jesus’ words are God’s words. The crowd must have left little room for Jesus to preach. We don’t know exactly where Jesus was, but it was possible that he was at a location south of Capernaum where there was a bay that formed a natural amphitheater. “Israeli scientists have verified that this bay can transmit a human voice effortlessly to several thousand people on shore.” To get an appropriate place to speak to this crowd, Jesus gets in a fishing boat and has its owner, Simon Peter, sail out a little way from the shore. Jesus then preaches from the boat.
Again, Luke doesn’t tell us what Jesus was preaching. We’ll hear a lot more of Jesus’ preaching as we go through the gospel. Luke is more concerned with what happens next. After Jesus finishes teaching, he tells Simon to try to fish. Now, we’re told that Simon and the other fishermen were washing the nets. This was probably a trammel net, which created a vertical wall of three layers of netting that caught fish. Because of the complexity of the nets, they needed to be washed after use. (I suppose the nets trapped weeds as well as fish.) The fact that the fishermen were washing the nets meant they were done fishing.
Simon’s response to Jesus in verse 5 is a bit skeptical, but it also shows his faith. He says, “Master, we toiled all night and took nothing!” It’s as if he’s saying, “Jesus, why are you telling us to fish. We’ve been fishing for hours and haven’t caught a thing!” But Simon also says, “But at your word I will let down the nets.” Simon’s experience tells him he won’t catch anything. It doesn’t seem likely at all. But he also trusts Jesus’ word. In chapter 4, we saw that Jesus healed Simon’s mother-in-law by his word (Luke 4:38–39), so Simon knows that Jesus’ word is powerful. He may not realize who Jesus is yet, but he knows Jesus is someone he should

SOLITAIRE, the device opened blocked vessels without causing symptomatic bleeding in or around the brain in 61 percent of patients. The standard Food and Drug Administration–approved mechanical device — a corkscrew-type clot remover called the MERCI Retriever — was effective in 24 percent of cases.
The use of the new device also led to better survival three months after a stroke. There was a 17.2 percent mortality rate with the new device, compared with a 38.2 percent rate with the older one.
About 87 percent of all strokes are caused by blood clots blocking a blood vessel supplying the brain. The stroke treatment that has received the most study is the FDA–approved clot-busting drug known as tissue plasminogen activator, but this drug must be given within four-and-a-half hours after the onset of stroke symptoms, and even more quickly in older patients.
When clot-busting drugs cannot be used or are ineffective, the clot can sometimes be mechanically removed during, or beyond, the four-and-a-half–hour window. The current study, however, did not compare mechanical clot removal to drug treatment.

terview) and not the Spanish-Language pronunciation.
I asked Chris about his favorite chapter in ‘To Selena With Love’ and he recalls the day they got married. As he tells his story I could picture everything in my head. He sounded so happy and in a way it really felt like we were both going back in time.
In the book Chris mentions how Selena’s father Abraham Quintanilla arrived one time at his mothers house so I asked him how he felt and if he was scared. He said he was and explains everything that happened.
I also asked Chris if it was a burden when asked questions about Selena. Chris says “that it was hard in the beginning but now it’s different.”
For over fifteen years Chris Perez held the memories of Selena close to his heart. Private memories that at times were painful regarding their friendship, their Amor Prohibido ‘Forbidden Love’ and everything else in between. Until now in To Selena, with Love.

Given the level of stress continuously practiced in skateboard shoes, endurance plays a critical role in their manufacture. Shoes must withstand wear and tear, as well as the massive impact on the ground and the skateboard. To create the skate shoes, manufacturers take into account many important features, including the outsole, upper materials, and zippers.
The outsole creates direct contact with the skateboard and must withstand the friction of the tape with the firm grip by itself while providing extra support to the skater. Top quality outer soles are an excellent choice for the ideal pair of shoes.
The upper material is usually reinforced to prevent skate shoes from being removed under constant pressure. Particular emphasis is often placed on the areas where the shoes come into direct contact with the grip band. Similarly, heavy-duty stitch patterns are made of the upper material to ensure that the shoes remain intact with continued use.
The lace barriers serve as a protective barrier for the cords as they will inevitably come in contact with the handle tape. Without these protective laces, signs of wear will quickly appear on the laces, causing discomfort. Some manufacturers have even modified the loop design to prevent the cords from ever touching the handle tape. Other manufacturers prefer rounded cables because they are more wear-resistant. New and innovative skateboard shoe designers can even add Kevlar coating to the cords to improve their quality and durability.
It is a factor to consider the cushioning inside the shoes. The hill of the shoes absorbs the maximum force. So it needs extra padding. Before buying a pair of the skate shoe, you should check this area is well-padded. Then the shoes will hold your feet in proper place. It is very common to get the injury and break the feet. The matter can cause for improper padding in Hill area and the collar. So, you should check this area is well-padded before choosing the shoes.
Skate shoes need to be flexible to move with the skateboard. It will help you to control the board. The vulcanized rubber soles are more flexible. The flexibility of the shoes protects you from getting injured.
When you go to buy a pair of skate shoes, you should consider the sizes. Buy the shoes that are accurate to your foot size. It is very necessary to play skateboard with an accurately sized shoes. If the shoe size is bigger, there is a possibility to fall from the board and get injured. Some shoes are narrow inside. At this condition, you need to buy ½ size bigger shoes. Moreover, if the shoes are a little bit small, your feet can get hurt. So, size is an important matter of your feelings and comfort.
The thick and thin soles depend on your skating styles and performance. Shoes wi

eapon to commit crimes). The police can alsoshare perceptions about the justice system to respond to violence.
3. Distinguish between a proactive and reactive police agency. What majorcharacteristics identify the proactive police agency?
We talk about Reactive Police Agency when the police respond to specific requests fromindividuals/groups in the community which encompasses immediate response to calls andfollow-up investigations. The Proactive Police Agency is when the police are acting on their own initiative, in orderto develop information about crime as well as strategies for suppression. For example, apolice officer reactively responding to a dispatched call could, nonetheless, resolve theissue proactively by mediating between the parties or using informal action. Similarly, incontrast to routine patrol, the directed patrol involves officers being instructed to monitorspecific areas that are identified through problem/crime analysis when they are notresponding to dispatch calls. Directed patrol is more proactive than random preventativepatrol, but it still lacks the component of problem oriented policing that engages thecommunity in resolving crime issues. Also proactive policing results in more arrests,detention and filing of reports than reactive policing.

What steps should be taken to prevent SSL certificate warnings for a website hosted on Apache or WampDeveloper
------------correct----------------------
When someone on a Windows XP system, or even using an older version of IE, goes to the SSL/HTTPS URL of your Apache or WampDeveloper hosted website, they might get a warning by their browser that the SSL Certificate does not match the website and/or get the wrong website. And in some situations this might also happen on recent OS versions (Vista, 7, etc).
To fix this –
Bind your website to the server’s public IP address. Only the SSL VirtualHost needs binding, the regular HTTP VirtualHost does not…
Edit the website’s SSL/HTTPS VirtualHost file (select website in WampDeveloper’s Websites Tab, then click the SSL VirtualHost button).
You can locate the Public IP address of your system in WampDeveloper’s System Tab.
For local-network only websites use the LAN IP address instead (see System Tab for IPv4 values).
Save file. Restart Apache.
If you only have 1 IP address assigned to your server, you can do the above without any issues as long as you’re okay with this website now answering *all* SSL/HTTPS requests that come in on that specific IP address, regardless of

the malware enters through an approved access point.
After gaining access to a particular network, the SamSam actors escalate privileges for administrator rights, drop malware onto the server, and run an executable file, all without victims’ action or authorization. While many ransomware campaigns rely on a victim completing an action, such as opening an email or visiting a compromised website, RDP allows cyber actors to infect victims with minimal detection.
Analysis of tools found on victims’ networks indicated that successful cyber actors purchased several of the stolen RDP credentials from known darknet marketplaces. FBI analysis of victims’ access logs revealed that the SamSam actors can infect a network within hours of purchasing the credentials. While remediating infected systems, several victims found suspicious activity on their networks unrelated to SamSam. This activity is a possible indicator that the victims’ credentials were stolen, sold on the darknet, and used for other illegal activity.
SamSam actors leave ransom notes on encrypted computers. These instructions direct victims to establish contact through a Tor hidden service site. After paying the ransom in Bitcoin and establishing contact, victims usually receive links to download cryptographic keys and tools to decrypt their network.

What agencies are issuing the activity alert regarding the SamSam ransomware
------------correct----------------------
We keep abreast of the latest cyber attacks and here’s one that we’re seeing a lot of coverage on we think you should know about – SamSam.
From the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) Report:
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are issuing this activity alert to inform computer network defenders about SamSam ransomware, also known as MSIL/Samas.A.
Specifically, this product shares analysis of vulnerabilities that cyber actors exploited to deploy this ransomware. In addition, this report provides recommendations for prevention and mitigation.
The SamSam actors targeted multiple industries, including some within critical infrastructure. Victims were located predominately in the United States, but also internationally. Network-wide infections against organizations are far more likely to garner large ransom payments than infections of individual systems. Organizations that provide essential functions have a critical need to resume operations quickly and are more likely to pay larger ransoms.
The actors exploit Windows servers to gain persistent access to a victim’s network and infect all reachable hosts. According to reporting from victims in early 2016, cyber actors used the JexBoss Exploit Kit to access vulnerable JBoss applications. Since mid-2016, FBI analysis of victims’ machines indicates that cyber actors use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to gain persistent access to victims’ networks. Typically, actors either use brute force attacks or stolen login credentials. Detecting RDP intrusions can be challenging because

What does Chris Perez describe about his initial feelings regarding questions about Selena
------------correct----------------------
terview) and not the Spanish-Language pronunciation.
I asked Chris about his favorite chapter in ‘To Selena With Love’ and he recalls the day they got married. As he tells his story I could picture everything in my head. He sounded so happy and in a way it really felt like we were both going back in time.
In the book Chris mentions how Selena’s father Abraham Quintanilla arrived one time at his mothers house so I asked him how he felt and if he was scared. He said he was and explains everything that happened.
I also asked Chris if it was a burden when asked questions about Selena. Chris says “that it was hard in the beginning but now it’s different.”
For over fifteen years Chris Perez held the memories of Selena close to his heart. Private memories that at times were painful regarding their friendship, their Amor Prohibido ‘Forbidden Love’ and everything else in between. Until now in To Selena, with Love.

------------question-----------------------
What does Greg J. Florio express in his op-ed regarding Connecticut communities and the concept of local control
------------correct----------------------
A lot of Connecticut’s problems are due to a prejudice against regionalization. This is made crystal-clear in an op-ed in today’s Hartford Courant by the executive director of the Capitol Region Education Council, a former superintendent of Cheshire schools, Greg J. Florio.
The topic of the op-ed is desegregating Hartford’s schools according to the Sheff v. O’Neill decision. He writes that “Connecticut communities value the concept of local control, especially of their schools. This will never change.” This love of local control is especially powerful because CT is one of the only two states in the U.S. that has no counties. Nothing but the state can stand up to Connecticut’s cities and towns.
However, Florio says that he sees “a willingness to come together to address these concerns of providing quality integrated education to all students with a regional approach: not regionalization, but regional thought

which website they are for. Otherwise, you’ll need to bind each website’s SSL VirtualHost to a separate and unique IP address.
This happens because –
The client OS and Browser must support SNI (Server Name Indication) for *multiple SSL websites running on the same 1 IP address* to work – vs. having to dedicate a separate IP address for each website.
If they don’t, you’ll just get back WampDeveloper’s “DefaultWebsite” (usually localhost) with it’s fake/bogus self-signed Certificate, which will always mis-match the correct website’s domain-name.
Unless the request is originating on XP, or an older version of IE, this isn’t usually an issue. But this problem can also arise with some IE settings being turned off on Vista, Windows 7, etc:
Make sure TLS (needed by SNI) is turned on for IE on the system the request is coming form (it is by default – but some programs like McAfee mess it up); have the client go to:
Control Panel > Internet Options/Settings > Advanced
In Security Group, make sure this is check-marked:
Use TLS (and SSL)
Then have the client restart IE.

La Jolla filmmaker Kai Collins and her writing partner, Deena Adar, will premiere their comedic television pilot “thirtyish” at the NewFilmmakers L.A. Film Festival on March 23. It was created through their self-established production company Quiet Duke.
“Ideally, we’ll use the pilot as a calling card to get people more familiar with our writing and our brand of comedy, and we’d love to sell the project,” Collins said.
The pilot explores the humor behind not meeting the expectations some set for themselves upon entering their 30s. Collins describes “thirtyish” as HBO’s “Girls” meets the 1987 drama “thirtysomething.”
“We’re writing about situations that are recognizable, and maybe the humor is coming from how awkward and uncomfortable it is, or how (you might think) ‘uh, I’ve been in that situation’ or ‘I’ve dated that person’ or ‘that is me,’” Collins explained. “We’re trying to reach beyond your standard sitcom and draw upon really personal experiences, as well as experiences of friends and family who are close to us, who’ve shared what they are going through.”
What they might be going through is a relationship falling apart or parenting struggles or, as Collins puts it, “just having a sense of realizing you’re a grownup and wondering how that happened.”
The impetus for the cable-network hopeful was a frustrated conversation between Collins and Adar about a project they were working on that wasn’t going anywhere. Worried they were on the wrong path, they started discussing the expectations, dreams and hopes they had for where they thought would be — and how they weren’t meeting them.

What is the theme of the television pilot 'thirtyish' created by Kai Collins and Deena Adar
------------correct----------------------
By Ashley Mackin
La Jolla filmmaker Kai Collins and her writing partner, Deena Adar, will premiere their comedic television pilot “thirtyish” at the NewFilmmakers L.A. Film Festival on March 23. It was created through their self-established production company Quiet Duke.
“Ideally, we’ll use the pilot as a calling card to get people more familiar with our writing and our brand of comedy, and we’d love to sell the project,” Collins said.
The pilot explores the humor behind not meeting the expectations some set for themselves upon entering their 30s. Collins describes “thirtyish” as HBO’s “Girls” meets the 1987 drama “thirtysomething.”
“We’re writing about situations that are recognizable, and maybe the humor is coming from how awkward and uncomfortable it is, or how (you might think) ‘uh, I’ve been in that situation’ or ‘I’ve dated that person’ or ‘that is me,’” Collins explained. “We’re trying to reach beyond your standard sitcom and draw upon really personal experiences, as well as experiences of friends and family who are close to us, who’ve shared what they are going through.”
What they might be going through is a relationship falling apart or parenting struggles or, as Collins puts it, “just having a sense of realizing you’re a grownup and wondering how that happened.”
The impetus for the cable-network hopeful was a frustrated conversation between Collins and Adar about a project they were working on that wasn’t going anywhere. Worried they were on the wrong path, they started discussing the expectations, dreams and hopes they had for where they thought would be — and how they weren’t meeting them.

numerous paintings, including some space scenes. Using their new skills, the children drew their cosmos the way they see it. They discovered how to use various drawing and paint-mixing techniques, named their paintings, and told one another about their unique planets.
For the Moscow office of BEITEN BURKHARDT, this event was a precious experience, giving us the chance to see the universe through the eyes of children in addition to our day-to-day legal work.
BEITEN BURKHARDT has been supporting the Kolomna Social Rehabilitation Centre for Minors for more than 10 years. The Kolomna Centre helps orphans and children from low-income, single-parent, and disadvantaged families that have found themselves in difficult circumstances. Children from the age of 3 to 17 without parental support live at the Centre on a permanent basis, while children from disadvantaged families study here during the day. Over the past 20 years, the Centre has helped more than 6,000 children and adolescents to believe in themselves, become part of society, develop their talents, and restore their self-confidence.

First of all, thepolice are in daily and regular contact with criminals, observe violence and have muchmore accurate perceptions of the criminal rate variations. Second, they are the peoplemost likely to translate perceptions of growing violent/non-violent crime into formalcharges. The police can report increase of violent, the nature of increase, causes andconsequences of such increase and even the quality of violent crime (violent/criminalpeople are much more able to use the w

If he’s right, it doesn’t matter what it’s called. But there can be no fairness in education (and much else) in our state without the support of the suburbs surrounding our cities.
Too much activism in our state is also focused on the cities. They are where the problems are most acute and where it is easiest to organize. But the best solutions will come only with the support of those who live in and manage the suburbs. They have the money and the power in Connecticut. Not only are they thrifty, but they don’t like to spend any money that will go outside their towns (they still haven’t swallowed state income tax, which is only 25 years old).
It’s going to take a lot of work to bring the suburbs on board. This is something that progressive seniors, with a history in their towns and time on their hands, will be best at. It’s something worth including in strategic planning discussions.

The new device is able to remove the clot and restire the blood circulation in one step. The researchers of UCLA Stroke Center have presented the “Covidien Solitaire FR Revascularization Device”, the idea of the device lies in the microcatheter that would be inserted, then the Solitaire will expand and retract back in the microcatheter after trapping the clot.
An experimental device for removing blood clots in stroke patients dramatically outperformed the standard mechanical treatment, according to research presented by UCLA Stroke Center director Dr. Jeffrey L. Saver at the American Stroke Association’s 2012 international conference in New Orleans on Feb. 3.
The SOLITAIRE Flow Restoration Device is among an entirely new generation of devices designed to remove blood clots from blocked brain arteries in patients experiencing stroke. It has a self-expanding, stent-like design and, once inserted into a clot using a thin catheter tube, it compresses and traps the clot. The clot is then removed by withdrawing the device, thus reopening the blocked blood vessel.

What must the client OS and browser support for multiple SSL websites to work on the same IP address
------------correct----------------------
which website they are for. Otherwise, you’ll need to bind each website’s SSL VirtualHost to a separate and unique IP address.
This happens because –
The client OS and Browser must support SNI (Server Name Indication) for *multiple SSL websites running on the same 1 IP address* to work – vs. having to dedicate a separate IP address for each website.
If they don’t, you’ll just get back WampDeveloper’s “DefaultWebsite” (usually localhost) with it’s fake/bogus self-signed Certificate, which will always mis-match the correct website’s domain-name.
Unless the request is originating on XP, or an older version of IE, this isn’t usually an issue. But this problem can also arise with some IE settings being turned off on Vista, Windows 7, etc:
Make sure TLS (needed by SNI) is turned on for IE on the system the request is coming form (it is by default – but some programs like McAfee mess it up); have the client go to:
Control Panel > Internet Options/Settings > Advanced
In Security Group, make sure this is check-marked:
Use TLS (and SSL)
Then have the client restart IE.

What unique ingredient did Deep Eddy Vodka begin using in its products last year
------------correct----------------------
ut says there are more details to come about other unique ingredients.
Deep Eddy Vodka in Austin is known for its successful Sweet Tea Vodka that launched in 2010. Last year, the company started using 9-year-old San Antonian Bo DeWees' Bo's Bees Honey in the bottles sold here. Deep Eddy expanded into 16 markets last year, and its newest product is an instant success. The grapefruit-flavored Deep Eddy Ruby Red launched earlier this month, and Brandon Cason, vice president of marketing, says they've had to increase production to keep it on shelves.
Dorcol Distilling Co. (pronounced door-chole) is under construction at 1902 S. Flores St. Co-founders Boyan Kalusevic and Chris Mobley plan to open the distillery this summer. It will produce unaged and aged spirits, as well as small-batch seasonal expressions.
Dripping Springs Vodka has come a long way since opening in 2007 and a setback with a fire in 2009 that destroyed the original distillery. The company introduced Dripping Springs Texas Orange about two years ago and 1876 Well Vodka last year. The distillery is unveiling a new label, and it has increased production by 20 percent in the past year to expand distribution into the Midwest.
Garrison Brothers Distillery Owner and distiller Dan Garrison only makes one spirit — bourbon — but he wants it to be the best. Garrison Brothers Texas Straight Bourbon Whiskey is produced in Hye, and it's one of the state's most sought-after spirits. Batches are released in vintages, and they quickly sell out. Garrison also released Texas Opus, a white dog whiskey, and has plans for a high-proof bourbon, Hye Rye and small releases of five, seven and 10-year reserves.
Ranger Creek Brewing & Distilling The local distiller recently released Rimfire in its small-caliber series. It's made from the same recipe as the Mesquite Smoked Porter minus the hops. The first release in the series was Ranger Creek .36 Texas Bourbon Whiskey, which earned 86 points from Whisky Advocate and a bronze medal from the American Distilling Institute's Craft American Spirits. The distillery plans to release in July Belgian White Whiskey as an evil twin to its La Bestia Belgian Ale.
Treaty Oak Distilling launched in 2007 in Austin with a Platinum Rum. Last year, it released Starlite Vodka, an aged rum, and Waterloo Gin, which has wonderful Texas botanical notes of lavender, grapefruit and lemon. Newer to the lineup are a Two-Year Barrel Reserve and plans for Waterloo Gin Antique, which is also aged.

------------question-----------------------
How do SamSam actors typically gain access to a network and what steps do they take after gaining access
------------correct----------------------
the malware enters through an approved access point.
After gaining access to a particular network, the SamSam actors escalate privileges for administrator rights, drop malware onto the server, and run an executable file, all without victims’ action or authorization. While many ransomware campaigns rely on a victim completing an action, such as opening an email or visiting a compromised website, RDP allows cyber actors to infect victims with minimal detection.
Analysis of tools found on victims’ networks indicated that successful cyber actors purchased several of the stolen RDP credentials from known darknet marketplaces. FBI analysis of victims’ access logs revealed that the SamSam actors can infect a network within hours of purchasing the credentials. While remediating infected systems, several victims found suspicious activity on their networks unrelated to SamSam. This activity is a possible indicator that the victims’ credentials were stolen, sold on the darknet, and used for other illegal activity.
SamSam actors leave ransom notes on encrypted computers. These instructions direct victims to establish contact through a Tor hidden service site. After paying the ransom in Bitcoin and establishing contact, victims usually receive links to download cryptographic keys and tools to decrypt their network.

the malware enters through an approved access point.
After gaining access to a particular network, the SamSam actors escalate privileges for administrator rights, drop malware onto the server, and run an executable file, all without victims’ action or authorization. While many ransomware campaigns rely on a victim completing an action, such as opening an email or visiting a compromised website, RDP allows cyber actors to infect victims with minimal detection.

------------answer-----------------------
here we grew up, our socioeconomic status. We put other people and even ourselves in neat little boxes. But that isn’t liberating. It’s suffocating. Why should those accidental properties define us? I can’t control the fact that I was born in 1976 to a white family, that I have blue eyes, that I’m 6’2”, that I have this set of genes, and so on. All those things are important parts of who I am, but why should they define me?
And why should our desires determine who we are? What if our desires are harmful? What if we desire things that are contrary to God’s design for our lives? Our feelings shouldn’t determine who we are. What if our feelings are eating us up? What if our feelings consist of anxiety and depression?
If we build our identity on past successes, what happens if we fail in the present, or in the future? What then? And what happens when we think of ourselves and all we think about are our failures? How can we get an identity that isn’t destroyed by all the ways we’ve made a mess of our lives?
The same could be said of relationships. If we build our primary identity on our status as husband or wife, what happens if our spouse leaves us or dies? If our primary identity is mother or father, what happens when our kids don’t turn out the way we hoped the would be, or what happens if, God forbid, they die?
What happens if we never had the family we wanted, the career we wanted, the life we wanted? How can we have an identity that is positive?
I want to press this home a little further. A couple of weeks ago I was talking to a wise, older friend. I was telling him about some recent difficulties that I’ve had. And I even told him that I’ve had a difficult time, emotionally speaking, over the last two years. I said that there was a point when I wanted to get out of my life. I wanted to stop being me. I wanted to hit the reset button, to start all over again, to be somewhere else, to be someone else. I remember telling friends that I felt like the opposite of King Midas. You may remember the story of King Midas: everything he touched turned to gold. I felt like every good gift that God had given me I turned to garbage.
Well, my friend said something very interesting. He said that being stuck with ourselves forever is hell. What he meant was that if we are stuck with ourselves and are not redeemed, not saved, not transformed, then that is hell. To be unchanged and without hope, and to be stuck with our old identities, is a kind of hell.
Some of the most profound thoughts about personal identity have come from the great theologian Augustine. In his famous book, the Confessions, he talks about how he became a Christian. He first pursued a life of pleasure and non-Christian philosophies. Reflecting back on that time, he writes, “I had become to myself a place of unhappiness in which I could not bear to be; but I could not escape from myself. Where should my heart flee to in escaping from my heart? Where should I go to escape myself? Where is there where I cannot pursue myself?” Over sixteen hundred years before I had these thoughts, Augustine had them first. Human nature doesn’t change.
Don’t all of us wish we were different? Maybe we wish we had a different family, a different career, a different station in life, or even a different body. This is what all of us feel. I’ve felt it. Augustine felt it. I’m sure you have, too.
When Augustine became a Christian, he realized the depth of his sin. He confessed, “My sin consisted in this, that I sought pleasure, sublimity, and truth not in God but in his creatures, in myself and other created beings.” We were made for God, to know him, love him, worship him, and serve him. But instead of treasuring the Creator, we treasure his creation. Instead of loving the Giver of all good gifts, we make idols of the gifts and ignore the Giver.
If this is the human condition, where can we go for help? Where can we find hope? How can we get new identities? How can we be changed?
The good news is that Jesus offers us new identities. He offers us transformation. He offers us change. And, in the end, he will bring about that change.
But first, we must realize that we have sinned. And we must own that fact.
Last week, I read a fascinating little book called The Riddle of Life. It was written by a Dutch missionary named Johan Bavinck over fifty years ago and it was recently translated into English. This book dares to ask the big questions of life, such as, “Who are we?” and “Why are we here?” In the course of the book, Bavinck describes the nature of sin. He says, “In our hearts we carry a goodly number of passions, and we are loath to reveal these most intimate thoughts to others, because we are well aware that they are not at all what they should be.” Deep down, we know we have thoughts and desires that we should be ashamed of. And we all know we have done things we shouldn’t have. In short, if we’re honest, we know we’re not right.
But there comes a choice. Do we admit that we’re not right, or do we talk ourselves into thinking that we’re okay, or we’re not as bad as those people over there?
The proper response to an encounter with God is to own our sin, not to shift the blame. Bavinck addresses this issue, too. He writes,
As much as possible, we want to blame our shortcomings on others and on institutions outside us. We continually want to rid ourselves of all blame, while the only route to real salvation is that we fully own up to our guilt, admit that the emptiness dwells in our own soul. To put it differently: we are inclined to explain our suffering in such a way that we are victims of hostile powers outside ourselves. Our victim-obsession deprives us of the real incentive to essential conversion. Thus the first thing we have to do is to recognize that we are totally on the wrong track, that our lives completely lack a goal, that we ourselves are entirely to blame, and that the fundamental fault lies first of all within ourselves. Only then have we arrived at the heart of the matter.
That quote is so very relevant for our world today. We cannot blame our sin on others, on outside forces or institutions. Yes, we may have been wronged by others. But we have wronged others, too. And we have to admit that we’ve not loved God or wanted to live life on his terms. Bavinck writes, “The real reason for denying sin is our constant effort to wrestle free from God and to resist his will.” In order to come back to God, we must first admit this and seek his forgiveness.
To know God is to know you’re a sinner. To know you’re a sinner is the first step to knowing the Savior. Jesus knows your sin. As God, he knows everything. Yet he still came and died for everyone who would simply trust him, who would run to him for refuge, who would come to him to find a new identity.
Jesus knew that Simon was a sinful man. Simon knew he had failed in life. He even failed at fishing. But what does Jesus say? “Let down your nets.” “But Jesus, we’ve fished all night and haven’t caught anything!” “Let down your nets.” “Jesus, get away from me, I’m a sinful man. You don’t know the things I’ve done.” “Let down your nets.” “Jesus, I can’t be of any use to God. I’m such a loser.” “Let down your nets.”
Simon didn’t have a lot of confidence in himself. But there’s one thing he had. He had confidence in Jesus’ words. So, at Jesus’ word, he tried fishing again. And he found that Jesus was right. And after he confessed his sin to Jesus, he let down his nets. He left behind his life of fishing and became an evangelist, catching people not to die, not to be sold and enslaved, but so that they would have eternal life, and new identities. In fact, Simon was given a new identity and even a new name. In John’s Gospel, when Jesus first meets Simon, he says, “‘You are Simon the son of John. You shall be called Cephas’ (which means Peter)” (John 1:42). Cephas and Peter both mean “rock.” In Matthew’s Gospel, when Peter says that Jesus is “the Christ, the Son of the living G

In what is fast becoming the Book Flood of Summer 2014, even more exciting books have been turning up in the post and as eARCs…
Featuring: Anna Caltabiano, Orson Scott Card & Aaron Johnston, Richard A. Clarke, James S.A. Corey, Ellen Datlow (ed.), Emma Donohue, Daryl Gregory, Elliott Hall, Doug Hulick, Kameron Hurley, Kendra Leighton, D.J. Molles, Edward St. Aubyns, Liesel Schwarz, Graeme Shimmin, Nalini Singh, James Thornton
Rebecca, a 15-year-old American, isn’t entirely happy with her life, comfortable though it is. Still, even she knows that she shouldn’t talk to strangers. So when her mysterious neighbour Miss Hatfield asked her in for a chat and a drink, Rebecca wasn’t entirely sure why she said yes. It was a decision that was to change everything.
For Miss Hatfield is immortal. And now, thanks to a drop of water from the Fountain of Youth, Rebecca is as well. But this gift might be more of a curse, and it comes with a price. Rebecca is beginning to lose her personality, to take on the aspects of her neighbour. She is becoming the next Miss Hatfield.
But before the process goes too far, Rebecca must travel back in time to turn-of-the-century New York and steal a painting, a picture which might provide a clue to the whereabouts of the source of immortality. A clue which must remain hidden from the world. In order to retrieve the painting, Rebecca must infiltrate a wealthy household, learn more about the head of the family, and find an opportunity to escape. Before her journey is through, she will also have – rather reluctantly – fallen in love. But how can she stay with the boy she cares for, when she must return to her own time before her time-travelling has a fatal effect on her body? And would she rather stay and die in love, or leave and live alone?
And who is the mysterious stranger who shadows her from place to place? A hunter for the secret of immortality – or someone who has already found it?
One of Gollancz’s 2014 debuts, I was very much looking forward to reading this. I’m reading it at the moment and, while interesting and pretty well done, it isn’t really grabbing me… Hopefully it will pick up as I near the end…
Nearly 100 years before the events of Orson Scott Card’s bestselling novel Ender’s Game, humans were just beginning to step off Earth and out into the Solar System. A thin web of ships in both asteroid belts; a few stations; a corporate settlement on Luna. No one had seen any sign of other space-faring races; everyone expected that First Contact, if it came, would happen in the future, in the empty reaches between the stars. Then a young navigator on a distant mining ship saw something moving too fast, heading directly for our sun.
When the alien ship screamed through the solar system, it disrupted communications between the far-flung human mining ships and supply stations, and between them and Earth. So Earth and Luna were unaware that they had been invaded until the ship pulled into Earth orbit, and began landing terra-forming crews in China. Politics and pride slowed the response on Earth, and on Luna, corporate power struggles seemed more urgent than distant deaths. But there are a few men and women who see that if Earth doesn’t wake up and pull together, the planet could be lost.
This is the third volume in Card & Johnston’s The First Formic War series. Sadly, I haven’t read any of the Ender’s Game-related novels, so I’m not sure I’ll get to this in the immediate future. I will, however, be reading Ender’s Game pretty soon.
In Washington, the Kill Committee gathers in the White House’s Situation Room to pick the next targets for the United States drone program. At an airbase just outside Las Vegas, a team of pilots, military personnel and intelligence officers follow through on the committee's orders, finding the men who have been deemed a threat to national security and sentenced to death. On the other side of the world, in the mountains where the drones hunt their prey, someone has decided to fight back. And not just against the unmanned planes that circle their skies, but against the Americans at home who control them.
I’ve read a fair bit of Clarke’s non-fiction, so I’m curious to see what his fiction is like. Hot topic, drones.
The gates have opened the way to thousands of habitable planets, and the land rush has begun. Settlers stream out from humanity's home planets in a vast, poorly controlled flood, landing on a new world. Among them, the Rocinante, haunted by the vast, posthuman network of the protomolecule as they investigate what destroyed the great intergalactic society that built the gates and the protomolecule.
But Holden and his crew must also contend with the growing tensions between the settlers and the company which owns the official claim to the planet. Both sides will stop at nothing to defend what's theirs, but soon a terrible disease strikes and only Holden – with help from the ghostly Detective Miller – can find the cure.
I’m so behind on this series… This is the fourth novel in The Expanse series, yet I’ve only managed to read the first one, Leviathan Wakes. It was recently announced that the TV rights for the series have been bought and (possibly) started development. I’d like to catch up, and I’ll do my best to do so.
This deliciously creepy and loving tribute to the master of modern horror features riveting illustrated stories of his wicked progeny.
In the century since the master of horror, H. P. Lovecraft, published his first story, the monstrosities that crawled out of his brain have become legend: the massive, tentacled Cthulhu, who lurks beneath the sea waiting for his moment to rise; the demon Sultan Azathoth, who lies babbling at the center of the universe, mad beyond imagining; the Deep Ones, who come to shore to breed with mortal men; and the unspeakably-evil Hastur, whose very name brings death. These creatures have been the nightmarish fuel for generations of horror writers, and the inspiration for some of their greatest works.
This impressive anthology celebrates Lovecraft's most famous beasts in all their grotesque glory, with each story a gripping new take on a classic mythos creature and affectionately accompanied by an illuminating illustration. Within these accursed pages something unnatural slouches from the sea into an all-night diner to meet the foolish young woman waiting for him, while the Hounds of Tindalos struggle to survive trapped in human bodies, haunting pool halls for men they can lure into the dark. Strange, haunting, and undeniably monstrous, this is Lovecraft as you have never seen him before.
Sounds like an interesting anthology.
Summer of 1876: San Francisco is in the fierce grip of a record-breaking heat wave and a smallpox epidemic. Through the window of a railroad saloon, a young woman called Jenny Bonnet is shot dead. The survivor, her friend Blanche Beunon, is a French burlesque dancer. Over the next three days, she will risk everything to bring Jenny's murderer to justice – if he doesn’t track her down first. The story Blanche struggles to piece together is one of free-love bohemians, desperate paupers and arrogant millionaires; of jealous men, icy women and damaged children. It’s the secret life of Jenny herself, a notorious character who breaks the law every morning by getting dressed: a charmer as slippery as the frogs she hunts.
In thrilling, cinematic style, FROG MUSIC digs up a long-forgotten, never-solved crime. Full of songs that migrated across the world, Emma Donoghue's lyrical tale of love and bloodshed among lowlifes captures the pulse of a boom town like no other.
Some of my own research touched upon Chinese immigration into San Francisco during this period, so I thought the novel sounded quite interesting.
Harrison was the Monster Detective, a storybook hero. Now he’s in his mid-thirties, and spends most of his time popping pills and not sleeping. Stan became a minor celebrity after being partially eaten by cannibals. Barbara is haunted

As with the variation of the skate shoe style, the type of materials used for their design varies widely. Skateboard shoes are made of the following materials:
Leather this material is known for its strength and its ability to be cast to accommodate your feet. The top three types of leather used to make skate shoes are nubuck, full-grain, and action leather. Nubuck leather provides adequate grip and durability. This means that skaters can perform more complicated maneuvers for longer, without having to worry too much about changing their shoes. Full Grain skin is considered to be the most durable and long-lasting material on the market. Action leather has similar properties to full-grain skin, but it is fragmented and less durable compared to leather.
Suede this material provides an excellent handle for maneuvering. It also provides a smooth finish and aristocratic appearance. Nevertheless, its durability is limited, especially when compared to the skin.
Synthetic materials, as the name implies, these materials are artificially created and given similar properties to those of naturally occurring materials, such as the skin. They tend to be a little cheaper than the skin but can withstand the pressure of everyday skating.
Given the level of stress continuously practiced in skateboard shoes, endurance plays a critical role in their manufacture. Shoes must withstand wear and tear, as well as the massive impact on the ground and the skateboard. To create the skate shoes, manufacturers take into account many important features, including the outsole, upper materials, and zippers.
The outsole creates direct contact with the skateboard and must withstand the friction of the tape with the firm grip by itself while providing extra support to the skater. Top quality outer soles are an excellent choice for the ideal pair of shoes.
The upper material is usually reinforced to prevent skate shoes from being removed under constant pressure. Particular emphasis is often placed on the areas where the shoes come into direct contact with the grip band. Similarly, heavy-duty stitch patterns are made of the upper material to ensure that the shoes remain intact with continued use.
The lace barriers serve as a protective barrier for the cords as they will inevitably come in contact with the handle tape. Without these protective laces, signs of wear will quickly appear on the laces, causing discomfort. Some manufacturers have even modified the loop design to prevent the cords from ever touching the handle tape. Other manufacturers prefer rounded cables because they are more wear-resistant. New and innovative skateboard shoe designers can even add Kevlar coating to the cords to improve their quality and durability.
It is a factor to consider the cushioning inside the shoes. The hill of the shoes absorbs the maximum force. So it needs extra padding.

REACTIVE VS PROACTIVE POLICE
1. Discuss the contributions of the English police system to the Americansystem of policing?
As you may know, the first colonial settlers who came to America were most of themEnglish. This means it was the English who brought with them the Peel law enforcementsystem. But later Americans modified this system since there are physical and culturalenvironment differences with England.History informs us that in 1844, New York was the first American city to model a policedepartment along the Peel law enforcement principals.For more information regarding US Police System to help you detail your homework,please check this link:http://law.jrank.org/pages/1675/Police-Organization-Management.html

BEITEN BURKHARDT organised its traditional charity event for children "We are the Cosmos"
Keeping up a longstanding tradition, the international law firm BEITEN BURKHARDT held the "We are the Cosmos" charity event for children from the Kolomna Municipal Social Rehabilitation Centre.
This year we set out with the children on a fascinating two-day journey through the vast expanse of the universe. The first day, the children were visited by employees of the Museum of Cosmonautics, one of the largest academic and historical museums in the world. They told the history of space exploration, from our canine space team, through the first space flight of Yuri Gagarin, and on to life on a space station. The children solved picture-puzzles and crosswords and answered questions. To wrap up the day, each child made his or her own planet, then brought all the small planets together to create their own universe under the slogan: "We are all different, but we are united!"
The second day, the children took part in an art master class called "My Planet" and were introduced to the art of Alexei Leonov, the first Soviet cosmonaut to perform a spacewalk. In addition to his achievements in space, Leonov is also the author of

------------answer-----------------------
Who are you? What is your identity? If our identity is found in our jobs, feelings, desires, accomplishments, or relationships, then our identity won’t be stable and it can be crushed. But our identity can be found in one who never fails. Jesus takes sinful people, losers and failures, and turns them into his people. Find out why Jesus gives us great hope. Pastor Brian Watson preaches this message based on Luke 5:1-11.
Who do you think you are?
That’s an important question. I don’t mean, what are you? The question of what human beings are is an important one, to be sure. But I have something far more personal in mind. Who are you? What is your identity?
The question of identity is an important one. It concerns how we think of ourselves and how we think of others. Think about what happens when you meet someone new. You start to identify that person by categories. We think of what a person looks like, his or her gender and age and looks, how that person is dressed, how they speak and act, and so on. When we get to know people, we often ask, “What do you do?” We mean, “What do you do for work?” or, “What do you do for a living?” That’s another way of identifying someone. We may ask, “Where are you from?” That, too, is a way of placing that person in a certain category.
The question of identity has also come front-and-center in many important political and cultural debates. The term “identity politics” addresses the issue of how people’s identity affects their politics. As far as I can tell, this began as an attempt to organize minority voices, which isn’t a bad thing at all. If, say, people who have a certain skin color and/or ethnicity aren’t getting their voices heard in the public square, it’s good for them to band together and make their views known. But what has happened is that now we pigeonhole people according to gender, skin color, religion, and sexual orientation, among other things. Instead of evaluating people according “to the content of their character,” as Martin Luther King put it, we assume that if people are white male Christians, they must think this way, or can’t possibly have anything to say to that issue. It seems that instead of getting less prejudiced, we’re getting more prejudiced, putting everyone into camps before we even know what each person is really like.
Today, many people identify themselves according to their desires, and this creates new classes of people. People who are transgender have a biological sex, yet they self-identify as having a different gender, the one usually associated with the opposite sex. So, a transgender man is a biological woman who feels that she is a man. People who are gay, lesbian, or bisexual identify themselves according to sexual desires. These identities are not rooted in biology, but only in desire. Imagine if you self-identified according to other dispositions, like pride, anger, lust, jealousy, and covetousness.
Our identities can also be based around our accomplishments or failures. We can find our self-worth in our jobs, our awards, our degrees, the amount of money we’ve made, or the way that people view us. Or, we can think of all the jobs we’ve lost, the awards we failed to earn, the degrees we never earned, the money we’ve lost, and the relationships we’ve lost.
What is your identity? Is it based on what you do for a living? Your political views? Your ethnicity? Your looks? Your desires? Your achievements? Your failures? When you think of yourself, what comes to mind? Who are you?
I ask this question because today we’re going to look at a passage of the Gospel of Luke that deals with identity. We’ve been studying this biography of Jesus for about three months, and we’ve seen that Jesus has recently begun his public ministry. He has preached a message of God’s kingdom and he has healed people. Now, he gathers some coworkers to himself. The story is rather simple: Jesus calls Simon Peter and a couple of associates to be his followers. They were fishermen, but Jesus gives them a new vocation: instead of catching fish, they will now catch people. (Don’t take that literally—I’ll explain what that means in a bit.) At the heart of this story is identity. Peter saw himself as a humble fisherman and, besides that, a sinful man. Yet Jesus summons Peter to take on a new identity. We might read this story as just a bit of religious history, but it’s much more than that. Jesus is still in the habit of calling sinful people to himself, giving them new identities and new roles to play.
So, with that in mind, let’s read Luke 5:1–11:
1 On one occasion, while the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the word of God, he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret, 2 and he saw two boats by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets. 3 Getting into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, he asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the people from the boat. 4 And when he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.” 5 And Simon answered, “Master, we toiled all night and took nothing! But at your word I will let down the nets.” 6 And when they had done this, they enclosed a large number of fish, and their nets were breaking. 7 They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink. 8 But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.” 9 For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish that they had taken, 10 and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, “Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching men.” 11 And when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed him.
As I said, the story is fairly simple, but I’ll give us a few details to explain. Jesus is at the “lake of Gennesaret,” which is another name for the Sea of Galilee. Jesus had been gaining a following, so there were people there who wanted “to hear the word of God.” Jesus’ words are God’s words. The crowd must have left little room for Jesus to preach. We don’t know exactly where Jesus was, but it was possible that he was at a location south of Capernaum where there was a bay that formed a natural amphitheater. “Israeli scientists have verified that this bay can transmit a human voice effortlessly to several thousand people on shore.” To get an appropriate place to speak to this crowd, Jesus gets in a fishing boat and has its owner, Simon Peter, sail out a little way from the shore. Jesus then preaches from the boat.
Again, Luke doesn’t tell us what Jesus was preaching. We’ll hear a lot more of Jesus’ preaching as we go through the gospel. Luke is more concerned with what happens next. After Jesus finishes teaching, he tells Simon to try to fish. Now, we’re told that Simon and the other fishermen were washing the nets. This was probably a trammel net, which created a vertical wall of three layers of netting that caught fish. Because of the complexity of the nets, they needed to be washed after use. (I suppose the nets trapped weeds as well as fish.) The fact that the fishermen were washing the nets meant they were done fishing.
Simon’s response to Jesus in verse 5 is a bit skeptical, but it also shows his faith. He says, “Master, we toiled all night and took nothing!” It’s as if he’s saying, “Jesus, why are you telling us to fish. We’ve been fishing for hours and haven’t caught a thing!” But Simon also says, “But at your word I will let down the nets.” Simon’s experience tells him he won’t catch anything. It doesn’t seem likely at all. But he also trusts Jesus’ word. In chapter 4, we saw that Jesus healed Simon’s mother-in-law by his word (Luke 4:38–39), so Simon knows that Jesus’ word is powerful. He may not realize who Jesus is yet, but he knows Jesus is someone he should

What is the main advantage of the Covidien Solitaire FR Revascularization Device in treating strokes compared to standard mechanical treatments
------------correct----------------------
The new device is able to remove the clot and restire the blood circulation in one step. The researchers of UCLA Stroke Center have presented the “Covidien Solitaire FR Revascularization Device”, the idea of the device lies in the microcatheter that would be inserted, then the Solitaire will expand and retract back in the microcatheter after trapping the clot.
An experimental device for removing blood clots in stroke patients dramatically outperformed the standard mechanical treatment, according to research presented by UCLA Stroke Center director Dr. Jeffrey L. Saver at the American Stroke Association’s 2012 international conference in New Orleans on Feb. 3.
The SOLITAIRE Flow Restoration Device is among an entirely new generation of devices designed to remove blood clots from blocked brain arteries in patients experiencing stroke. It has a self-expanding, stent-like design and, once inserted into a clot using a thin catheter tube, it compresses and traps the clot. The clot is then removed by withdrawing the device, thus reopening the blocked blood vessel.

April 29, 2022 12:00am
DNOW // April 29-May 1
The DNOW theme this year is "Likeness" - we will be looking to Scripture to better understand our identity being rooted in the image (or "likeness") of God, how sin distorts that image, but Jesus, being the perfect representation of God, restores our identity and likeness through his life, death, and resurrection. We are going to pack this weekend with awesome activities, times of worship, and digging into Scripture to strengthen our walks with Jesus.
Like last year, we will not be staying in host homes. Each day, students will arrive/get dropped off at the church building and leave/get picked up at the end of the day.

and regional solutions.”
If he’s right, it doesn’t matter what it’s called. But there can be no fairness in education (and much else) in our state without the support of the suburbs surrounding our cities.
Too much activism in our state is also focused on the cities. They are where the problems are most acute and where it is easiest to organize. But the best solutions will come only with the support of those who live in and manage the suburbs. They have the money and the power in Connecticut. Not only are they thrifty, but they don’t like to spend any money that will go outside their towns (they still haven’t swallowed state income tax, which is only 25 years old).
It’s going to take a lot of work to bring the suburbs on board. This is something that progressive seniors, with a history in their towns and time on their hands, will be best at. It’s something worth including in strategic planning discussions.

ut says there are more details to come about other unique ingredients.
Deep Eddy Vodka in Austin is known for its successful Sweet Tea Vodka that launched in 2010. Last year, the company started using 9-year-old San Antonian Bo DeWees' Bo's Bees Honey in the bottles sold here. Deep Eddy expanded into 16 markets last year, and its newest product is an instant success. The grapefruit-flavored Deep Eddy Ruby Red launched earlier this month, and Brandon Cason, vice president of marketing, says they've had to increase production to keep it on shelves.
Dorcol Distilling Co. (pronounced door-chole) is under construction at 1902 S. Flores St. Co-founders Boyan Kalusevic and Chris Mobley plan to open the distillery this summer. It will produce unaged and aged spirits, as well as small-batch seasonal expressions.
Dripping Springs Vodka has come a long way since opening in 2007 and a setback with a fire in 2009 that destroyed the original distillery. The company introduced Dripping Springs Texas Orange about two years ago and 1876 Well Vodka last year. The distillery is unveiling a new label, and it has increased production by 20 percent in the past year to expand distribution into the Midwest.
Garrison Brothers Distillery Owner and distiller Dan Garrison only makes one spirit — bourbon — but he wants it to be the best. Garrison Brothers Texas Straight Bourbon Whiskey is produced in Hye, and it's one of the state's most sought-after spirits. Batches are released in vintages, and they quickly sell out. Garrison also released Texas Opus, a white dog whiskey, and has plans for a high-proof bourbon, Hye Rye and small releases of five, seven and 10-year reserves.
Ranger Creek Brewing & Distilling The local distiller recently released Rimfire in its small-caliber series. It's made from the same recipe as the Mesquite Smoked Porter minus the hops. The first release in the series was Ranger Creek .36 Texas Bourbon Whiskey, which earned 86 points from Whisky Advocate and a bronze medal from the American Distilling Institute's Craft American Spirits. The distillery plans to release in July Belgian White Whiskey as an evil twin to its La Bestia Belgian Ale.
Treaty Oak Distilling launched in 2007 in Austin with a Platinum Rum. Last year, it released Starlite Vodka, an aged rum, and Waterloo Gin, which has wonderful Texas botanical notes of lavender, grapefruit and lemon. Newer to the lineup are a Two-Year Barrel Reserve and plans for Waterloo Gin Antique, which is also aged.

How does the text describe the struggle with personal identity and the role of sin in understanding one's identity
------------correct----------------------
here we grew up, our socioeconomic status. We put other people and even ourselves in neat little boxes. But that isn’t liberating. It’s suffocating. Why should those accidental properties define us? I can’t control the fact that I was born in 1976 to a white family, that I have blue eyes, that I’m 6’2”, that I have this set of genes, and so on. All those things are important parts of who I am, but why should they define me?
And why should our desires determine who we are? What if our desires are harmful? What if we desire things that are contrary to God’s design for our lives? Our feelings shouldn’t determine who we are. What if our feelings are eating us up? What if our feelings consist of anxiety and depression?
If we build our identity on past successes, what happens if we fail in the present, or in the future? What then? And what happens when we think of ourselves and all we think about are our failures? How can we get an identity that isn’t destroyed by all the ways we’ve made a mess of our lives?
The same could be said of relationships. If we build our primary identity on our status as husband or wife, what happens if our spouse leaves us or dies? If our primary identity is mother or father, what happens when our kids don’t turn out the way we hoped the would be, or what happens if, God forbid, they die?
What happens if we never had the family we wanted, the career we wanted, the life we wanted? How can we have an identity that is positive?
I want to press this home a little further. A couple of weeks ago I was talking to a wise, older friend. I was telling him about some recent difficulties that I’ve had. And I even told him that I’ve had a difficult time, emotionally speaking, over the last two years. I said that there was a point when I wanted to get out of my life. I wanted to stop being me. I wanted to hit the reset button, to start all over again, to be somewhere else, to be someone else. I remember telling friends that I felt like the opposite of King Midas. You may remember the story of King Midas: everything he touched turned to gold. I felt like every good gift that God had given me I turned to garbage.
Well, my friend said something very interesting. He said that being stuck with ourselves forever is hell. What he meant was that if we are stuck with ourselves and are not redeemed, not saved, not transformed, then that is hell. To be unchanged and without hope, and to be stuck with our old identities, is a kind of hell.
Some of the most profound thoughts about personal identity have come from the great theologian Augustine. In his famous book, the Confessions, he talks about how he became a Christian. He first pursued a life of pleasure and non-Christian philosophies. Reflecting back on that time, he writes, “I had become to myself a place of unhappiness in which I could not bear to be; but I could not escape from myself. Where should my heart flee to in escaping from my heart? Where should I go to escape myself? Where is there where I cannot pursue myself?” Over sixteen hundred years before I had these thoughts, Augustine had them first. Human nature doesn’t change.
Don’t all of us wish we were different? Maybe we wish we had a different family, a different career, a different station in life, or even a different body. This is what all of us feel. I’ve felt it. Augustine felt it. I’m sure you have, too.
When Augustine became a Christian, he realized the depth of his sin. He confessed, “My sin consisted in this, that I sought pleasure, sublimity, and truth not in God but in his creatures, in myself and other created beings.” We were made for God, to know him, love him, worship him, and serve him. But instead of treasuring the Creator, we treasure his creation. Instead of loving the Giver of all good gifts, we make idols of the gifts and ignore the Giver.
If this is the human condition, where can we go for help? Where can we find hope? How can we get new identities? How can we be changed?
The good news is that Jesus offers us new identities. He offers us transformation. He offers us change. And, in the end, he will bring about that change.
But first, we must realize that we have sinned. And we must own that fact.
Last week, I read a fascinating little book called The Riddle of Life. It was written by a Dutch missionary named Johan Bavinck over fifty years ago and it was recently translated into English. This book dares to ask the big questions of life, such as, “Who are we?” and “Why are we here?” In the course of the book, Bavinck describes the nature of sin. He says, “In our hearts we carry a goodly number of passions, and we are loath to reveal these most intimate thoughts to others, because we are well aware that they are not at all what they should be.” Deep down, we know we have thoughts and desires that we should be ashamed of. And we all know we have done things we shouldn’t have. In short, if we’re honest, we know we’re not right.
But there comes a choice. Do we admit that we’re not right, or do we talk ourselves into thinking that we’re okay, or we’re not as bad as those people over there?
The proper response to an encounter with God is to own our sin, not to shift the blame. Bavinck addresses this issue, too. He writes,
As much as possible, we want to blame our shortcomings on others and on institutions outside us. We continually want to rid ourselves of all blame, while the only route to real salvation is that we fully own up to our guilt, admit that the emptiness dwells in our own soul. To put it differently: we are inclined to explain our suffering in such a way that we are victims of hostile powers outside ourselves. Our victim-obsession deprives us of the real incentive to essential conversion. Thus the first thing we have to do is to recognize that we are totally on the wrong track, that our lives completely lack a goal, that we ourselves are entirely to blame, and that the fundamental fault lies first of all within ourselves. Only then have we arrived at the heart of the matter.
That quote is so very relevant for our world today. We cannot blame our sin on others, on outside forces or institutions. Yes, we may have been wronged by others. But we have wronged others, too. And we have to admit that we’ve not loved God or wanted to live life on his terms. Bavinck writes, “The real reason for denying sin is our constant effort to wrestle free from God and to resist his will.” In order to come back to God, we must first admit this and seek his forgiveness.
To know God is to know you’re a sinner. To know you’re a sinner is the first step to knowing the Savior. Jesus knows your sin. As God, he knows everything. Yet he still came and died for everyone who would simply trust him, who would run to him for refuge, who would come to him to find a new identity.
Jesus knew that Simon was a sinful man. Simon knew he had failed in life. He even failed at fishing. But what does Jesus say? “Let down your nets.” “But Jesus, we’ve fished all night and haven’t caught anything!” “Let down your nets.” “Jesus, get away from me, I’m a sinful man. You don’t know the things I’ve done.” “Let down your nets.” “Jesus, I can’t be of any use to God. I’m such a loser.” “Let down your nets.”
Simon didn’t have a lot of confidence in himself. But there’s one thing he had. He had confidence in Jesus’ words. So, at Jesus’ word, he tried fishing again. And he found that Jesus was right. And after he confessed his sin to Jesus, he let down his nets. He left behind his life of fishing and became an evangelist, catching people not to die, not to be sold and enslaved, but so that they would have eternal life, and new identities. In fact, Simon was given a new identity and even a new name. In John’s Gospel, when Jesus first meets Simon, he says, “‘You are Simon the son of John. You shall be called Cephas’ (which means Peter)” (John 1:42). Cephas and Peter both mean “rock.” In Matthew’s Gospel, when Peter says that Jesus is “the Christ, the Son of the living G

We keep abreast of the latest cyber attacks and here’s one that we’re seeing a lot of coverage on we think you should know about – SamSam.
From the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) Report:
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are issuing this activity alert to inform computer network defenders about SamSam ransomware, also known as MSIL/Samas.A.
Specifically, this product shares analysis of vulnerabilities that cyber actors exploited to deploy this ransomware. In addition, this report provides recommendations for prevention and mitigation.
The SamSam actors targeted multiple industries, including some within critical infrastructure. Victims were located predominately in the United States, but also internationally. Network-wide infections against organizations are far more likely to garner large ransom payments than infections of individual systems. Organizations that provide essential functions have a critical need to resume operations quickly and are more likely to pay larger ransoms.
The actors exploit Windows servers to gain persistent access to a victim’s network and infect all reachable hosts. According to reporting from victims in early 2016, cyber actors used the JexBoss Exploit Kit to access vulnerable JBoss applications. Since mid-2016, FBI analysis of victims’ machines indicates that cyber actors use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to gain persistent access to victims’ networks. Typically, actors either use brute force attacks or stolen login credentials. Detecting RDP intrusions can be challenging because

ns deeper than the council's mostly happy face suggests. A College Park dentist with a long list of civic contributions, Gordy declared his candidacy on Nov. 1; it was Hood's surprise action to revive a light-rail line that finally pushed him to challenge her bid for a third four-year term.

Texas was late to the craft distilling party, but it's quickly catching up to other states.

Texas was late to the craft distilling party, but it's quickly catching up to other states.
Sixteen years ago, Tito's Handmade Vodka paved the way as the first legal Texas distillery. Now, there are 45 distilling permits registered with the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission, although not all of them are producing. The market has grown rapidly, and some have risen above the rest. Not only has the number of distilleries increased, but the variety of products they are making continues to expand. Here is a roundup, in alphabetical order, of updates and trend-setting distillers and some of their new products.
Balcones Distilling Any discussion about the future of Texas distilling should start with Chip Tate's Balcones Distilling in Waco. It opened five years ago with Balcones Rumble distilled from honey, mission figs and turbinado sugar; and Baby Blue, a whiskey made from Hopi blue corn meal. The expanded lineup includes Balcones Single Malt Whiskey, Balcones True Blue Cask Strength, Balcones Brimstone, True Blue 100 Proof and Rumble Cask Reserve. Among its more than 40 awards, the distillery was named 2012 Craft Whiskey Distillery of the Year among Whisky Magazine's Icons of Whisky, and 2012 Global Distillery of the Year and U.S. Craft Distillery of the Year at the Wizards of Whisky International Competition.
Banner Distilling Co. in New Sweden was granted its permit on April 4. Co-founders Logan Simpson and Tony Jimenez have spent years in the tech industry but wanted a change of pace. “I really have this need, desire to make a product that people can hold and touch and enjoy,” Simpson says. He plans to use local ingredients, including grains grown by farmers within the county. Simpson wouldn't reveal much more b

What is the position of the ISRA regarding gun control and the rights of law-abiding citizens
------------correct----------------------
eedoms that make us all Americans. As we have seen in the past, the gun control movement's solution to criminal violence is to curtail the basic Constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens.
The gun control movement seems all too eager to surrender hard-fought liberties to those bent on domination of the American spirit. The nation's firearm owners, on the other hand, will not surrender to the criminal element and we will not knuckle under to those so willing to do so.
We are confident that, in the end, logic and reason will prevail and the nation will turn toward rooting out wickedness and away from vilifying the very people who make this the greatest nation on earth."
The ISRA is the state's leading advocate of safe, lawful, and responsible firearms ownership. For more than a century, the ISRA has represented the interests of millions of law-abiding Illinois firearm owners.

ted writing the pilot for “thirtyish” based on the questions they were asking themselves. Questions like, “Why does it take three months to get together with friends — when everyone is so busy with kids and work — and we used to just ride our bikes over to our friend’s house and get together.”
“So it went from us tearing our hair out in the morning, frustrated, to a matter of hours later having a complete pilot outlined,” Collins said, They had actors committed to the project soon after, and took that as a sign they were back on track.
Having written viral videos and short sketches in the past (some have received thousands of hits by viewers and are available at
), Collins took this as an opportunity to express her smart sense of humor.
“We try to transcend limitations and boundaries and what you might expect two 30-year-old women to write about,” she said, “We’re really drawn to reaching beyond the typical setup of set-up-punchline.”
She said her evolved sense of humor came from watching people and the encouragement she got while at Muirlands Middle and La Jolla High schools.
She participated in drama programs at both schools, but it was at La Jolla High that she worked with now- retired drama teacher Walter Stewart. Calling Stewart “my favorite teacher — ever,” she said, “In terms of the quality of instruction I was receiving and the materials he encouraged us to pursue, it was a great experience and definitely instilled a sense of creativity and love for the theater.”
Collins carried those lessons to college, studying theater and participating in improv troupes such as Chicago’s Second City. She now lives in Los Angeles

------------question-----------------------
What is the effectiveness rate of the new device SOLITAIRE compared to the MERCI Retriever in opening blocked vessels for stroke patients
------------correct----------------------
SOLITAIRE, the device opened blocked vessels without causing symptomatic bleeding in or around the brain in 61 percent of patients. The standard Food and Drug Administration–approved mechanical device — a corkscrew-type clot remover called the MERCI Retriever — was effective in 24 percent of cases.
The use of the new device also led to better survival three months after a stroke. There was a 17.2 percent mortality rate with the new device, compared with a 38.2 percent rate with the older one.
About 87 percent of all strokes are caused by blood clots blocking a blood vessel supplying the brain. The stroke treatment that has received the most study is the FDA–approved clot-busting drug known as tissue plasminogen activator, but this drug must be given within four-and-a-half hours after the onset of stroke symptoms, and even more quickly in older patients.
When clot-busting drugs cannot be used or are ineffective, the clot can sometimes be mechanically removed during, or beyond, the four-and-a-half–hour window. The current study, however, did not compare mechanical clot removal to drug treatment.

Similarly, incontrast to routine patrol, the directed patrol involves officers being instructed to monitorspecific areas that are identified through problem/crime analysis when they are notresponding to dispatch calls. Directed patrol is more proactive than random preventativepatrol, but it still lacks the component of problem oriented policing that engages thecommunity in resolving crime issues. Also proactive policing results in more arrests,detention and filing of reports than reactive policing.

------------question-----------------------
What is the central predicament faced by Drothe in 'The First Stone'
------------correct----------------------
p my street). I’ll be getting to this hopefully very soon, after I get my review of Speed of Dark ready. The First Stone is the first in a trilogy, so hopefully I’ll like this one and have more to read! The rest of the series includes The Fall (a prequel short story), The Rapture and The Children’s Crusade. I just bought the prequel, so I’ll slot that in before starting this.
It’s been three months since Drothe killed a legend, burned down a portion of the imperial capital, and unexpectedly elevated himself into the ranks of the criminal elite. Now, as the newest Gray Prince in the underworld, he’s learning just how good he used to have it.
With barely the beginnings of an organization to his name, Drothe is already being called out by other Gray Princes. And to make matters worse, when one dies, all signs point to Drothe as wielding the knife. As members of the Kin begin choosing sides – mostly against him – for what looks to be another impending war, Drothe is approached by a man who not only has the solution to Drothe’s most pressing problem, but an offer of redemption. The only problem is the offer isn’t for him.
Now Drothe finds himself on the way to the Despotate of Djan, the empire’s long-standing enemy, with an offer to make and a price on his head. And the grains of sand in the hour glass are running out, fast...
Loved the first book, very glad this one has finally arrived!

On the eve of a recurring catastrophic event known to extinguish nations and reshape continents, a troubled orphan evades death and slavery to uncover her own bloody past… while a world goes to war with itself.
In the frozen kingdom of Saiduan, invaders from another realm are decimating whole cities, leaving behind nothing but ash and ruin.
As the dark star of the cataclysm rises, an illegitimate ruler is tasked with holding together a country fractured by civil war, a precocious young fighter is asked to betray his family and a half-Dhai general must choose between the eradication of her father’s people or loyalty to her alien Empress.
Through tense alliances and devastating betrayal, the Dhai and their allies attempt to hold against a seemingly unstoppable force as enemy nations prepare for a coming together of worlds as old as the universe itself.
In the end, one world will rise – and many will perish.
I’ve mentioned this before on the blog. Will get to it pretty soon.

I’ve mentioned this novel a few times on the blog, recently. It sounds really interesting. The publicity material makes a big deal out of the fact that the novel is inspired by Alfred Noyes’s The Highwayman. Before reading the synopsis for this novel, I had never heard of that story, so I’m not sure I’ll be able to comment on that aspect, when I get around to reviewing this. I recently sent interview questions to Kendra, so expect that to go up mid-June. [Full disclosure: Kendra and I are friends from undergrad.]
In a steel-and-lead encased bunker a Special Forces soldier wait on his final orders.
On the surface a bacterium has turned 90% of the population into hyper-aggressive predators.
Now Captain Lee Harden must leave the bunker and venture into the wasteland to rekindle a shattered America.
I do like post-apocalyptic novels. This was a self-published success before Orbit picked up the series. Hopeful it’ll be entertaining, and better than the Ex-Heroes series, which was another move-to-big-publisher zombie series that I… did not like much. This printed edition also includes the novella, “An Empty Soul” (not, as the back cover copy suggests, “Faith”).
The judges on the panel of the Elysian Prize for Literature must get through hundreds of submissions to find the best book of the year. Meanwhile, a host of writers are desperate for Elysian attention: the brilliant writer and serial heartbreaker Katherine Burns; the lovelorn debut novelist Sam Black; and Bunjee, convinced that his magnum opus,The Mulberry Elephant, will take the literary world by storm. Things go terribly wrong when Katherine’s publisher accidentally submits a cookery book in place of her novel; one of the judges finds himself in the middle of a scandal; and Bunjee, aghast to learn his book isn’t on the short list, seeks revenge.
Lost for Words is a witty, fabulously entertaining satire that cuts to the quick of some of the deepest questions about the place of art in our celebrity-obsessed culture, and asks how we can ever hope to recognize real talent when everyone has an agenda.
I’m almost finished, actually. It’s pretty good, too. Imagine everything you don’t like about publishing, literary society, and the most annoying denizens that inhabit it. Then make fun of them in a clever, wry manner. Short review coming soon (it doesn’t need a long one).
Liesel Schwartz, A Clockwork Heart & Sky Pirates (Del Rey UK)
FOR BETTER OR CURSE. That might as well have been the wedding vow of Elle Chance and her new husband, the ex-Warlock Hugh Marsh in the second book of this edgy new series that transforms elements of urban fantasy, historical adventure, and paranormal romance into storytelling magic.
As Elle devotes herself to her duties as the Oracle – who alone has the power to keep the dark designs of Shadow at bay – Marsh finds himself missing the excitement of his former life as a Warlock. So when Commissioner Willoughby of the London Metropolitan police seeks his help in solving a magical mystery, Marsh is only too happy to oblige. But in doing so, Marsh loses his heart… literally.
In place of the flesh-and-blood organ is a clockwork device – a device that makes Marsh a kind of zombie. Nor is he the only one. A plague of clockwork zombies is afflicting London, sowing panic and whispers of revolution. Now Elle must join forces with her husband’s old friend, the Nightwalker Loisa Beladodia, to track down Marsh’s heart and restore it to his chest before time runs out.
I met Liesel Schwartz at a signing for her debut novel (the first in this series). Sadly, I haven’t got around to reading that novel, yet… Sigh. So many books, so very little time to get through them all…

“I don’t like killing, but I’m good at it. Murder isn’t so bad from a distance, just shapes in my scope. Close up work though, the garrotte around the neck, the knife in the heart, it’s not for me. Too much empathy, that’s my problem. Usually. But not today. Today is different…”
The year is 1955 and something is very wrong with the world: Churchill is dead and WW2 didn't happen. Europe is in thrall to a nuclear-armed Nazi Germany. Only Britain and its Empire holds out, bound by an uneasy truce and all the while German scientists are experimenting with terrifying forces beyond their understanding - forces that are driving them to the brink of insanity and beyond.
Berlin is a hotbed of suspicion and betrayal – a lone British assassin is fighting a private war with the Nazis; the Gestapo are on the trail of a beautiful young resistance fighter and the head of the SS plots to dispose of an increasingly decrepit Adolf Hitler and become Fuhrer. While in London, a sinister and treacherous cabal will stop at nothing to conceal the conspiracy of the century.
Four desperate scenarios that are destined to collide with catastrophic effect. And it all hinges on a single kill in the morning…
Never heard of this before it arrived in the mail. Sounds kind of interesting, too.
Assassin. Soldier. Arrow. That is who Vasic is, who he will always be. His soul drenched in blood, his conscience heavy with the weight of all he's done, he exists in the shadows, far from the hope his people can almost touch – if only they do not first drown in the murderous insanity of a lethal contagion. To stop the wave of death, Vasic must complete the simplest and most difficult mission of his life.

p my street). I’ll be getting to this hopefully very soon, after I get my review of Speed of Dark ready. The First Stone is the first in a trilogy, so hopefully I’ll like this one and have more to read! The rest of the series includes The Fall (a prequel short story), The Rapture and The Children’s Crusade. I just bought the prequel, so I’ll slot that in before starting this.
It’s been three months since Drothe killed a legend, burned down a portion of the imperial capital, and unexpectedly elevated himself into the ranks of the criminal elite. Now, as the newest Gray Prince in the underworld, he’s learning just how good he used to have it.
With barely the beginnings of an organization to his name, Drothe is already being called out by other Gray Princes. And to make matters worse, when one dies, all signs point to Drothe as wielding the knife. As members of the Kin begin choosing sides – mostly against him – for what looks to be another impending war, Drothe is approached by a man who not only has the solution to Drothe’s most pressing problem, but an offer of redemption. The only problem is the offer isn’t for him.
Now Drothe finds himself on the way to the Despotate of Djan, the empire’s long-standing enemy, with an offer to make and a price on his head. And the grains of sand in the hour glass are running out, fast...

It’s been three months since Drothe killed a legend, burned down a portion of the imperial capital, and unexpectedly elevated himself into the ranks of the criminal elite. Now, as the newest Gray Prince in the underworld, he’s learning just how good he used to have it.
With barely the beginnings of an organization to his name, Drothe is already being called out by other Gray Princes. And to make matters worse, when one dies, all signs point to Drothe as wielding the knife. As members of the Kin begin choosing sides – mostly against him – for what looks to be another impending war, Drothe is approached by a man who not only has the solution to Drothe’s most pressing problem, but an offer of redemption. The only problem is the offer isn’t for him.
Now Drothe finds himself on the way to the Despotate of Djan, the empire’s long-standing enemy, with an offer to make and a price on his head. And the grains of sand in the hour glass are running out, fast...
Loved the first book, very glad this one has finally arrived!

On the eve of a recurring catastrophic event known to extinguish nations and reshape continents, a troubled orphan evades death and slavery to uncover her own bloody past… while a world goes to war with itself.
In the frozen kingdom of Saiduan, invaders from another realm are decimating whole cities, leaving behind nothing but ash and ruin.
As the dark star of the cataclysm rises, an illegitimate ruler is tasked with holding together a country fractured by civil war, a precocious young fighter is asked to betray his family and a half-Dhai general must choose between the eradication of her father’s people or loyalty to her alien Empress.
Through tense alliances and devastating betrayal, the Dhai and their allies attempt to hold against a seemingly unstoppable force as enemy nations prepare for a coming together of worlds as old as the universe itself.
In the end, one world will rise – and many will perish.
I’ve mentioned this before on the blog. Will get to it pretty soon.

I’ve mentioned this novel a few times on the blog, recently. It sounds really interesting. The publicity material makes a big deal out of the fact that the novel is inspired by Alfred Noyes’s The Highwayman. Before reading the synopsis for this novel, I had never heard of that story, so I’m not sure I’ll be able to comment on that aspect, when I get around to reviewing this. I recently sent interview questions to Kendra, so expect that to go up mid-June. [Full disclosure: Kendra and I are friends from undergrad.]
In a steel-and-lead encased bunker a Special Forces soldier wait on his final orders.
On the surface a bacterium has turned 90% of the population into hyper-aggressive predators.
Now Captain Lee Harden must leave the bunker and venture into the wasteland to rekindle a shattered America.
I do like post-apocalyptic novels. This was a self-published success before Orbit picked up the series. Hopeful it’ll be entertaining, and better than the Ex-Heroes series, which was another move-to-big-publisher zombie series that I… did not like much. This printed edition also includes the novella, “An Empty Soul” (not, as the back cover copy suggests, “Faith”).
The judges on the panel of the Elysian Prize for Literature must get through hundreds of submissions to find the best book of the year. Meanwhile, a host of writers are desperate for Elysian attention: the brilliant writer and serial heartbreaker Katherine Burns; the lovelorn debut novelist Sam Black; and Bunjee, convinced that his magnum opus,The Mulberry Elephant, will take the literary world by storm. Things go terribly wrong when Katherine’s publisher accidentally submits a cookery book in place of her novel; one of the judges finds himself in the middle of a scandal; and Bunjee, aghast to learn his book isn’t on the short list, seeks revenge.
Lost for Words is a witty, fabulously entertaining satire that cuts to the quick of some of the deepest questions about the place of art in our celebrity-obsessed culture, and asks how we can ever hope to recognize real talent when everyone has an agenda.
I’m almost finished, actually. It’s pretty good, too. Imagine everything you don’t like about publishing, literary society, and the most annoying denizens that inhabit it. Then make fun of them in a clever, wry manner. Short review coming soon (it doesn’t need a long one).
Liesel Schwartz, A Clockwork Heart & Sky Pirates (Del Rey UK)
FOR BETTER OR CURSE. That might as well have been the wedding vow of Elle Chance and her new husband, the ex-Warlock Hugh Marsh in the second book of this edgy new series that transforms elements of urban fantasy, historical adventure, and paranormal romance into storytelling magic.
As Elle devotes herself to her duties as the Oracle – who alone has the power to keep the dark designs of Shadow at bay – Marsh finds himself missing the excitement of his former life as a Warlock. So when Commissioner Willoughby of the London Metropolitan police seeks his help in solving a magical mystery, Marsh is only too happy to oblige. But in doing so, Marsh loses his heart… literally.
In place of the flesh-and-blood organ is a clockwork device – a device that makes Marsh a kind of zombie. Nor is he the only one. A plague of clockwork zombies is afflicting London, sowing panic and whispers of revolution. Now Elle must join forces with her husband’s old friend, the Nightwalker Loisa Beladodia, to track down Marsh’s heart and restore it to his chest before time runs out.
I met Liesel Schwartz at a signing for her debut novel (the first in this series). Sadly, I haven’t got around to reading that novel, yet… Sigh. So many books, so very little time to get through them all…
Also on CR: Interview with Liesel Schwarz
“I don’t like killing, but I’m good at it. Murder isn’t so bad from a distance, just shapes in my scope. Close up work though, the garrotte around the neck, the knife in the heart, it’s not for me. Too much empathy, that’s my problem. Usually. But not today. Today is different…”
The year is 1955 and something is very wrong with the world: Churchill is dead and WW2 didn't happen. Europe is in thrall to a nuclear-armed Nazi Germany. Only Britain and its Empire holds out, bound by an uneasy truce and all the while German scientists are experimenting with terrifying forces beyond their understanding - forces that are driving them to the brink of insanity and beyond.
Berlin is a hotbed of suspicion and betrayal – a lone British assassin is fighting a private war with the Nazis; the Gestapo are on the trail of a beautiful young resistance fighter and the head of the SS plots to dispose of an increasingly decrepit Adolf Hitler and become Fuhrer. While in London, a sinister and treacherous cabal will stop at nothing to conceal the conspiracy of the century.
Four desperate scenarios that are destined to collide with catastrophic effect. And it all hinges on a single kill in the morning…
Never heard of this before it arrived in the mail. Sounds kind of interesting, too.
Assassin. Soldier. Arrow. That is who Vasic is, who he will always be. His soul drenched in blood, his conscience heavy with the weight of all he's done, he exists in the shadows, far from the hope his people can almost touch – if only they do not first drown in the murderous insanity of a lethal contagion. To stop the wave of death, Vasic must complete the simplest and most difficult mission of his life.
For if the Psy race is to survive, the empaths must wake…

What inspired Collins to write the pilot for 'thirtyish'
------------correct----------------------
ted writing the pilot for “thirtyish” based on the questions they were asking themselves. Questions like, “Why does it take three months to get together with friends — when everyone is so busy with kids and work — and we used to just ride our bikes over to our friend’s house and get together.”
“So it went from us tearing our hair out in the morning, frustrated, to a matter of hours later having a complete pilot outlined,” Collins said, They had actors committed to the project soon after, and took that as a sign they were back on track.
Having written viral videos and short sketches in the past (some have received thousands of hits by viewers and are available at
), Collins took this as an opportunity to express her smart sense of humor.
“We try to transcend limitations and boundaries and what you might expect two 30-year-old women to write about,” she said, “We’re really drawn to reaching beyond the typical setup of set-up-punchline.”
She said her evolved sense of humor came from watching people and the encouragement she got while at Muirlands Middle and La Jolla High schools.
She participated in drama programs at both schools, but it was at La Jolla High that she worked with now- retired drama teacher Walter Stewart. Calling Stewart “my favorite teacher — ever,” she said, “In terms of the quality of instruction I was receiving and the materials he encouraged us to pursue, it was a great experience and definitely instilled a sense of creativity and love for the theater.”
Collins carried those lessons to college, studying theater and participating in improv troupes such as Chicago’s Second City. She now lives in Los Angeles

DNOW // April 29-May 1
The DNOW theme this year is "Likeness" - we will be looking to Scripture to better understand our identity being rooted in the image (or "likeness") of God, how sin distorts that image, but Jesus, being the perfect representation of God, restores our identity and likeness through his life, death, and resurrection. We are going to pack this weekend with awesome activities, times of worship, and digging into Scripture to strengthen our walks with Jesus.
Like last year, we will not be staying in host homes. Each day, students will arrive/get dropped off at the church building and leave/get picked up at the end of the day.

eedoms that make us all Americans. As we have seen in the past, the gun control movement's solution to criminal violence is to curtail the basic Constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens.
The gun control movement seems all too eager to surrender hard-fought liberties to those bent on domination of the American spirit. The nation's firearm owners, on the other hand, will not surrender to the criminal element and we will not knuckle under to those so willing to do so.
We are confident that, in the end, logic and reason will prevail and the nation will turn toward rooting out wickedness and away from vilifying the very people who make this the greatest nation on earth."
The ISRA is the state's leading advocate of safe, lawful, and responsible firearms ownership. For more than a century, the ISRA has represented the interests of millions of law-abiding Illinois firearm owners.
