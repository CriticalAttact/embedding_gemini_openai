What task has Apsalar been given involving a list of targets
------------correct----------------------
Welcome to the Malazan Re-read of the Fallen! Every post will start off with a summary of events, followed by reaction and commentary by your hosts Bill and Amanda (with Amanda, new to the series, going first), and finally comments from Tor.com readers. In this article, we’ll cover Chapter Three of The Bonehunters by Steven Erikson (TB).
A fair warning before we get started: We’ll be discussing both novel and whole-series themes, narrative arcs that run across the entire series, and foreshadowing. Note: The summary of events will be free of major spoilers and we’re going to try keeping the reader comments the same. A spoiler thread has been set up for outright Malazan spoiler discussion.
Apsalar wonders why if Shadowthrone wanted Mebra dead because of the Nameless Ones or possibly the old Shadow cult. She thinks the last person on her list of targets will be the hardest, tries to convince herself to simply do it, then thinks maybe she’ll talk to someone nearby about how to walk away. Cotillion appears and they discuss Mebra, Telorast and Curdle, Edgewalker, her future, and her upcoming visit.
Telorast and Curdle fade at the sunrise, much to their dismay. Apsalar finds the Pardu women and Gral from the night before. Upon her return, Telorast and Curdle tell her someone was in her room, though their description is a bit confusing.
Apsalar and the two ghosts return to Mebra’s place. The Pardu women arrive, Apsalar incapacitates them, and learns their employer is Karpolan Demesand of the Trygalle Trade Guild. The Pardu woman says they are returning from Y’Ghatan and they were trying to purchase information from Mebra. Apsalar explains what happened then knocks her out. They find tablets hidden under a pavestone with Mebra’s notes.
Samar Dev and Karsa have gone out to Moraval Keep. Karsa says he’ll go in himself when nobody can say the last time they saw any Malazans in the Keep.
Karsa breaks open the huge, locked iron doors of the keep, stunning his witnesses.
Inside, Karsa finds a pit where something massive had been spiked down. He is attacked by a giant short-tailed lizard and they fight.
Outside, Samar Dev, Captain Inashan and others wonder at the noise within. Samar Dev tells them the Keep is ancient and had been filled with strange mechanisms.
Karsa kills the lizard.
Karsa appears outside, looking terrible. He tells them he didn’t see any Malazans and leaves.
Corabb and Leoman discuss their destination: Y’Ghatan. Leoman corrects Corabb’s mistaken believe that Dassem Ultor died there and tells him Dassem ascended and is Dessembrae, The Lord of Tragedy. He adds he is a “reluctant god” and is in constant flight and/or possibly eternally hunting. He asks Corabb if he will stand beside him no matter what he commands and Corabb says yes.
Fiddler talks magic with Bottle. They find Nil and Nether engaged in a ritual crossing through Hood’s Gate to look for Sormo E’nath and dead Wickans from the Chain of Dogs. Bottle senses something and jumps in the ritual and finds them being upbraided by their mother. Bult’s ghost appears and tells them “we do not belong here” then leaves.
Quick Ben, Kalam, Stormy and others have gotten lost in the Imperial Warren (or out of it). They’re being followed by something out of Chaos. They wait and see lots of massive things “filling the sky” and Quick says it’s time to go.
Amanda’s Reaction to Chapter Three
“Bones in the Wall” – Author Unknown. “And yet I remain, with all my kin…” Deliberate mystery at the start of Chapter Three!
Ha! I can just imagine Curdle taking on a chamber pot as her new body in error. Erikson likes to throw in these little clues: “You want something alive. Really alive, with legs that work. Or wings…”
I find it curious that Apsalar considers Cutter to be naive. I mean, I do as well, but I also think you can level the same charge at Apsalar herself. Sure she has some of the memories of Cotillion, but that doesn’t mean she has any true experience. Certainly when it comes to love and feelings she seems very naive. I can’t help thinking, in fact, that Cutter and Apsalar are incredibly well suited, if only they could realise it.
Hmm, now we find out that Apsalar’s task is to kill a succession of people listed by Shadowthrone and Cotillion, “with the final target the most challenging of all…” And someone she feels no enmity towards. I guess we should start wondering who that person is. Has Erikson already started dropping little clues and I’m just missing them?
I like this: “Still, what made a god decide to kill some lowly mortal? The minor irritation of a stone in a moccasin. The slap of a branch on a wooded trail.” We’ve seen a number of occasions now where a mortal has proved to be much, much more than gods expect them to be.
We’ve spoken about the odd relationship between Apsalar and Cotillion before—here there is more to fuel it: “She reached up with one hand and brushed the line of his jaw, the gesture close to a caress. She caught the sudden intake of his breath, the slight widening of his eyes, but he would not look at her.” This seems to have hints of romance about it.
I am glad that Cotillion feels remorse for what he did to Apsalar—it was a grotesque action and he continues to use her (although with her assent), but he clearly have intentions of leaving her in a better position. I feel so sorry for her.
Ooh! Who is it that Apsalar is going to drop in on? I’m sure I’ll find out very soon, but my curiosity is piqued now!
It is interesting that someone is spying on Apsalar and trying to find out about her while she does the same to other people. Obviously she has been noted. A big, black, hairy demon with fangs and claws wearing boots, hmm? No one immediately comes to mind with that description, although my memory could be failing me.
Just as an aside and a possible discussion point, even when given a description of what a person or creature looks like, I generally don’t keep a visual of them in my head. I tend to gloss over the description. I know some people read really visually and can see everything represented down to the last hair and blade of grass, but I struggle to do this. Which kind of reader are you?
Speaking of not being able to picture things, I’m struggling to understand what this shadowy aqueduct thing is and where it has come from! Were I Apsalar (and you can be damn sure I’m glad I’m not!) I would be asking more questions about where it’s come from and who provided it… Certainly Apsalar isn’t able to pin down Telorast or Curdle on it:
“What is this?”
“We don’t know.”
“It is from the Shadow Realm, isn’t it? It has to be. Otherwise I would be unable to see it.”
“Oh yes. We think. Don’t we, Telorast?”
“Absolutely. Or not.”
It sounds like they might be in a different fragment of Kurald Emurlahn (dear God, that is difficult to spell!), especially because they see some Tiste Edur. Oh, and who is the person dead in the canal? And are they dead in the real world or in the shadow realm? Am I reading too much into all of this? Except…mention of “a most delicious throne”… Curious. The Shadow Throne—the real one? Or another throne? (Especially because Telorast says: “You have lost your mind. Naught but pain. Suffering. Affliction…” Hey, if it’s affliction is there finally a warren/throne, etc for the Crippled God? I mean, he is in the deck of dragons now… Maybe he has an associated dragon!)
Telorast and Curdle aren’t very good at keeping up appearances, are they? “Women, like you. Like us, too. I forgot. Yes, we’re all women here…”
Apsalar is badass. Needs to be said. She takes down these two Pardu caravan guards effortlessly, and is utterly ruthless in extracting information. Nasty. And then there is the point where the Pardu guard thinks that Apsalar will kill her after she’s given over her info.
Ooh! The Trygalle Trade Guild make another appearance.
Apsalar is actually referred to here as Shadow Dancer—I guess this is some kind of master assassin?
So the opening poem mentioned Y’Ghatan and

orite program and why?
How has Compex helped your training?
I've not needed massage for over 2 years since I've started using Compex and also remained injury free for the first time in my career. The compex and its large variety of functions has allowed me to function at my optimum much more often.
How did you enter into the triathlon world?
I was living in LA and wanted to compete at something. I'd heard about the Oceanside 70.3 and what an amazing event it was so figured if go and give it go. I absolutely loved it, was instantly addicted, and the rest as they say is history.
When did you know you were ready to compete in IRONMAN?
I don't know if you ever know that your ready to compete in an ironman, at some point you've just got to take the plunge. Jump and the net will appear as they say.

What are some significant elements found in the corpus of inscriptions from Yemeni museums mentioned in the text
------------correct----------------------
Yemeni Museums and Corpus of Inscriptions from the British Museum.
Most part of the texts comes from the region of Hamdān (jabal Riyām, al-Ḥuqqa, Ḥāz, Nāʿiṭ), and consists of dedications to local varieties of the God Tʾlb or other deities. Some of those are written on bronze, like the corpus of the tablets from ʿAmrān. Particularly relevant from the cultural point of view are an edict regulating homicide (CIH 126) and a dedication to Tʾlb which is also a political "manifesto" of a king of S¹mʿy (CIH 37). Interesting inscriptions from cities of the Jawf (al-Bayḍāʾ, as-Sawdāʾ) and from the temple of Maḥrām Bilqīs in Mārib, mainly housed in the museums of Yemen, are also included in this corpus.
This is the corpus home page. You can begin the consultation of the whole corpus by using the indexes and tools menu on the left or you can consult only one of its sub-corpora, when present, by choosing from the list below.

------------question-----------------------
Who designed the knife mentioned in the text
------------correct----------------------
ll-bearing system that pulls out a silver tongue. A fighter or a chunk of a knife comes from the previous Marine Les George.
This is an attractive knife that will pull you within the moment you’re taking it out of the package. It shimmers like a blade, and once placed quite seven inches, it will desire. The edition focuses on Dmitry Sinkevich. It is massive and stylish.
Its ascendant was a large knife, strictly during a container. For an oversized factory-made piece, this is often more worthy than the trendy adoption name. The flipping action is impressive, lets it set out quick, and therefore the sheer size and stone-washed titanium handle that just about shines makes it a monster during a dark alley.
This knife was designed by Todd Rexford. It is Elmax chrome steel, .156 “thick a three.5” drop purpose blade. It has a sharp and high-quality blade. This ZT blade includes a tungsten element DLC blackwash end, a flipper, and a swish ambidextrous one-handed gap cavity ball-carrying system.
It has a Titanium handle. It is 4.7 “off, has a blackwash finish, notched texturing for a secure grip, a frame lock, and a lanyard hole. This ZT knife has a side-to-side reversible metal pocket clip mounted on the end of the hinge. It weighs 5.8 ounces.
There are many kinds of zero-tolerance blades. Men and women can keep the knives within the pockets through paracords, cut folks off sunken cars, and quickly cut pockets because they need to run out of ammunition for AR-15s and still have hostility. So they should have the best zt knife for self defense.

What does former police officer Rick Dalton say about the stance of a serving officer on cannabis legalization
------------correct----------------------
To the Editor:
These cops live in some sort of fantasy construct that sort of resembles reality, but not quite. Witness the letter from former (thank goodness) police officer Rick Dalton published in the Feb. 16 Almaguin News, “Former officer weighs in on pot debate.”
He calls out a serving officer who advocates for legalization of cannabis, ignoring the fact that LEAP (Law Enforcement Against Prohibition) has been saying the same things for years, and ignoring also the courage that it takes for said officer to speak out. He says a bunch of nasty things about said officer, and ends by saying that he, like all good people would turn in their child for a cannabis offense.

------------question-----------------------
What is suggested as the reason that Georgia does not receive favorable treatment in college sports
------------correct----------------------
all over this at Bama. As long as you field a team with a chance to win the SEC, and/or the BCS, you will be given a pass. Officials will give you every questionable call, you can pay potential players fathers, and you can change grades willy nilly. There are two sets of rules in the SEC and the NCAA. Win at any cost and you will be afforded special consideration, be average or worse and you will be fodder for the winners.
“As long as you field a team with a chance to win the SEC, and/or the BCS, you will be given a pass”
Must be the reason UGA does not get a pass these days.
The biggest problem here is the NCAA hanging the Death Penalty over the heads of Bama. Unless they intend to use it, I dont think they will, they have set themselves up as a paper tiger. Which, with all the other lame enforcement actions they have had this year, pretty much sets the NCAA up with no teeth…unless your program isn’t in the BCS hunt.
With each additional commit Saban gets this year, another unsuspecting young adult gets kicked out of school, pressured to transfer, grayshirted, etc.
So glad the University of Georgia is shackled to such people.
The SEC motto is after all “IF you ain’t cheating you ain’t trying.” Too bad Mark never learned this at FSU.
The point is that it ain’t cheating, at least not to the NCAA. I actually agree with CMR that the practice is reprehensible but , while Bama started it, everybody else in the conference now is doing it, too. The problem is, like the old joke, if you “bring a knife to a gun fight “…….
Not qualifying academically at Alabama is like Head Start saying no to a 4yr old from the projects.

andard 6% Acryl etc. Short runs will take
two hours at about 50V/cm (2300 V). The recommended speed in the Red
Book is 70 V/cm, but they get very hot at this voltage.

------------answer-----------------------
e weapon that is perfect for you is one of the big draws of the AR platform and will continue to be for a long time to come. If you are unsure if it is Mil-Spec then ask the seller questions, if they do not know then take the time to research it on the web. It is important to know what you are buying.
The next section that I want to touch on is the sighting system you plan to use. Are you going to use iron sights or optics? If you are going to use optics, then there are a few things to know before you layout your hard earned money. Again, we need to go back to what the weapon is intended to be used for. If you are using it for self-defense, then iron sights should be all you need. Heck, if they are close enough, you could just point it at them and probably get the job done. There is no point in wasting your money on fancy optics if you are only going to be using it in close quarters situations. Now, on to optics… the ugly truth is that all of those cheap optics and scopes on the market are just junk and you would be better not to waste your money on them. If you can’t afford a good set then use the iron sights until you can afford to get a good one. Think about this, the optics are the interface between you and the weapon. If it fails, you fail and if old man Murphy has anything to say about it, it will fail at the worst possible time! Do not risk your life or that once in a lifetime shot on a cheap piece of junk. Make it a point to get you a good one. If you are looking to be shooting, in the 1 to 200 yard range, then you will want an optic (or scope) that has something like a 1 to 4 zoom on it to help you make those long shots while still allowing you to make the close ones as well. If however you are going after those really long shots that are 2 to 700 yards then you will want something that can bring those really hard shots into focus with maybe a 4+ zoom and a wide aperture. After all, you can’t shoot what you can’t see.
When you go to buy your first AR weapon, try to bring along someone who has one and knows what to look for. You will be glad you did. These are just a few of the things to look for and as I can put together more information for you I will be adding new articles on this subject. Let me say again, that this is just my opinion and others may vary. In any case do your homework and learn as much about the AR platform and brands as you can. One of my favorite websites on this subject is www.AR15.com. It is a really great site and has a forum of experienced users to answer any question that you might have. Just remember that just because someone says they are an expert, it doesn’t mean that they are. Look for trends. If someone says that something is good and a lot of people agree than it is probably a safe bet that they are, and I would question if a single person says something is good and the others disagree. Like I said, look for trends and patterns on what is good and bad. Most of these folks will be more than glad to answer your questions and help you along your way.
Well, that is it for today, and I hope I may have passed along a little information that you can use when you set out to purchase your first AR rifle. Until next time, keep on prepping

all over this at Bama. As long as you field a team with a chance to win the SEC, and/or the BCS, you will be given a pass. Officials will give you every questionable call, you can pay potential players fathers, and you can change grades willy nilly. There are two sets of rules in the SEC and the NCAA. Win at any cost and you will be afforded special consideration, be average or worse and you will be fodder for the winners.
“As long as you field a team with a chance to win the SEC, and/or the BCS, you will be given a pass”
Must be the reason UGA does not get a pass these days.
The biggest problem here is the NCAA hanging the Death Penalty over the heads of Bama. Unless they intend to use it, I dont think they will, they have set themselves up as a paper tiger. Which, with all the other lame enforcement actions they have had this year, pretty much sets the NCAA up with no teeth…unless your program isn’t in the BCS hunt.
With each additional commit Saban gets this year, another unsuspecting young adult gets kicked out of school, pressured to transfer, grayshirted, etc.
So glad the University of Georgia is shackled to such people.
The SEC motto is after all “IF you ain’t cheating you ain’t trying.” Too bad Mark never learned this at FSU.
The point is that it ain’t cheating, at least not to the NCAA. I actually agree with CMR that the practice is reprehensible but , while Bama started it, everybody else in the conference now is doing it, too. The problem is, like the old joke, if you “bring a knife to a gun fight “…….
Not qualifying academically at Alabama is like Head Start saying no to a 4yr old from the projects.

orite program and why?
How has Compex helped your training?
I've not needed massage for over 2 years since I've started using Compex and also remained injury free for the first time in my career. The compex and its large variety of functions has allowed me to function at my optimum much more often.
How did you enter into the triathlon world?
I was living in LA and wanted to compete at something. I'd heard about the Oceanside 70.3 and what an amazing event it was so figured if go and give it go. I absolutely loved it, was instantly addicted, and the rest as they say is history.
When did you know you were ready to compete in IRONMAN?
I don't know if you ever know that your ready to compete in an ironman, at some point you've just got to take the plunge. Jump and the net will appear as they say.

What is the effect of using different Match_types in the MATCH function in Excel
------------correct----------------------
ducting more advanced multi-dimensional lookups based on multiple criteria. However, to use these more advanced functions of Excel, learning how to use the MATCH function effectively is crucial.

Using MATCH functions in Excel
Now, let us learn how to use MATCH functions in Excel to locate numeric values or even text.
In this first example, the values in the range A1 to A3 are arranged in ascending order.
So, if we wish to locate the matching value for ‘25’, we will be using this MATCH formula in Excel:
This will be what is returned: 2
This will return the value ‘2’ as that is the position of the row containing the closest number to ‘25’. There was no exact match, so 22 was identified by the function as it has a lower value than ‘25’ and because we used ‘1’ as our Match_type. Additionally, we have used ‘A1:A3’ as our Lookup_array as this is the range containing the numbers. If the array was sorted in descending order, we would have to use ‘-1’ in this function for the Match_type.
In the case of a negative approximate match type, a number bigger than ‘22’ or any Lookup_value would be identified. However, if we use ‘-1’ and the array is not in descending order, the matching function will return an error.
In the next example, let us try to locate the position of ‘Cookies’ among the three words occupying the cells inside the range of A1:A3.
This will be the formula:
When we locate text, we must keep the Lookup_value inside “ ” to allow the function to figure out the position of the text. The case does not matter in MATCH functions, as even without using “Cookies” (C in uppercase), and by using “cookies” (c in lowercase), we can still find the matching position. However, MATCH functions can be combined with an EXACT function to make the function case-sensitive and accurately find the exact combination of alphabets.
Here is one final example where we will try locating the location of the approximate value or the next larger number in an array sorted in descending order.
In this example, we will use 35 as the Lookup_value.
This will be the formula:
This will be what is returned: 1
40 will be chosen as the matching value as it is greater than 35 even though both 40 and 30 are the closest to 35. Also, if there are any issues with the order of the array or in the data, the MATCH function will return “#N/A”.
Now, let us take the instance where we do not numerically declare the Lookup_value in the formula. We can also choose to mention the position of another cell to use that value as the active Lookup_value in the formula. Since the value occupying D1 is 35, we can also use this formula:
Here, just D1 is replacing “35” in the formula.

Learning the MATCH function is essential to use any INDEX MATCH formula in Excel for advanced lookups. Also, it is essential to remember that MATCH functions in Excel only work on the text with a maximum of 255 characters. In the case of duplicate values, the function retrieved the first match. For EXACT matches or when the Match_type is “0”, you can also use the wildcards in the Lookup_value.
The MATCH function is crucial for Data Science and is extensively used with the INDEX function. A top-tier Data Analytics Program from Upgrad is bound to take you places in your career.
If you are already pursuing a career in this field but in a dilemma about what to do next in your career, you can find some of the best mentorship services by industry experts in upGrad.
If you’d like to gain in-depth knowledge of Python, we recommend upGrad’s online Professional Certificate Program in Data Science and Business Analytics from the University of Maryland, which is one of the top 100 global universities in the world.
1. Is the MATCH function case-sensitive?
No, the MATCH function is not case-sensitive.
2. Can the MATCH function be used both horizontally and vertically?
Yes, it can be used horizontally and vertically if combined with the INDEX function.
3. Are MATCH functions capable of retrieving values and not just row positions?
MATCH functions can also retrieve associated (related) values or specific values if combined with other functions.

2016 has been the year when your most annoying Eeyore friend has been proven right, over, and over again.
Reward them for their prescience and counsel that everything is terrible, with this map, which shows how likely (or unlikely) it is that you will survive World War Three.
The map, created by 'Would I Survive a Nuke'.com, comes with several options that allow users to personalise their demise.
One can choose the location, and what type of weapon of mass destruction will be used in the conflict.
'Dinosaur ending meteor' is one of many WMDs that also include 'Fat-man' atomic bomb, and the LG-30 'Minute Man' or the LG-18 'Peacekeeper' intercontinental ballistic missiles, depending on your Megaton preference.
Based on his gung-ho comments regarding the use of nuclear weapons, president-elect Donald Trump appears to be emulating the 'mad man Richard Nixon' strategy of deterrence, by speaking about the use of thousands of warheads so brazenly, that enemies of the US will fear he might actually do it.
According to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons the nine nuclear countries have a combined 15,000 nuclear weapons at their disposal.
Trump's acquisition of the launch codes for 6,970 warheads, makes this map not only a morbid reminder that we are all one miscommunication away from a fiery death, but also a useful tool for assessing just how bad that death may be.
The graphics show exactly what areas will suffer first, second, and third degree burns respectively in the event of a nuclear strike on any chosen location.
The site doesn't log any kind of location data, so there are no statistics for the most searched nuclear targets.

------------answer-----------------------
The editors' question was specific to how the Department of Justice would interpret Robert Lewis Dear's assault and murders, but it mirrored the debate that springs up immediately after these events about what constitutes a terrorist act vs. other forms of violence. Terrorism is generally defined as a tactic using violence or the threat of violence to inspire fear in pursuit of a political goal.
The question raised by the editors points to the difficulty--and in their view the importance--of how we label incidents like this. Because of the prominence of Planned Parenthood as a political issue raised by Republicans over the past several months, people quickly looked to see how the Republican presidential candidates would respond to the question the editors raised. Mike Huckabee, a candidate with impeccable anti-abortion credentials who won the Iowa caucuses in 2008, held down the straightforward, call-a-spade-a-spade, end of the spectrum when he declared that Dear's action was domestic terrorism. Carly Fiorina and Ted Cruz hunkered down at the other end of the spectrum. Cruz took pains to suggest all manner of alternative explanations for why Dear did what he did--most remarkable of which was that Dear may be a transgendered leftist activist--in a strikingly defensive effort to deflect any culpability from his own anti-Planned Parenthood vitriol of the past few months. The queen of anti-Planned Parenthood vitriol, Carly Fiorina, launched a leftists-at-the-gates counter offensive.
Newspaper editors know better than most--their jobs are literally about parsing words and meaning after all--that terrorism is a highly subjective term. The use of the term terrorist today cannot be divorced from the language of the global war on terrorism (GWOT) declared by the United States in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. One of the consequences of the GWOT is that it has provided a vocabulary that has come to be used by governments across the globe to label one's opponents in morally absolute terms, and in turn for sanctioning all manner of state action against them. Vladimir Putin rose quickly to our defense after the 9/11 attacks, as he saw in our determination to go to war half-way around the world under the banner of the GWOT a post-hoc justification for his own wars against Chechen separatists.
There are myriad other examples of how the language of terrorism has since been used. Bashir al-Assad used the language of terrorism in the early days of civil protests against his regime, as he quickly labeled real and manufactured events as the work of terrorists to justify the tenor of the regime's own violent assault against its own people. China has used the language of the GWOT to justify its suppression of Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang and Buddhists in Tibet. In Myanmar, the Buddhist majority and Muslim minority has struggled for the linguistic upper hand, as each has labeled the other side as the terrorists. Terrorism is both a tactic utilized against a state or other more powerful adversary, and a propaganda tool, in the GWOT context, used by those in power for the labeling of their enemy and the justification for means used to defeat it.
Each of these circumstances suggests the subjective nature of the terrorist label. Terrorism is what we call what the other guys do--the bad guys. That suggests why Ted Cruz cannot allow the murders in Colorado to be labeled an act of terrorism. While Robert Lewis Dear may (or may not) have been inspired by Cruz's history of vitriolic attacks on the evils of Planned Parenthood, Ted Cruz does not view his own rhetoric as extreme. To Ted Cruz, the other guys are the extremists, while he is a strict constitutionalist advocating for what he believes would be the mainstream of American thought if America had not deviated from its founding principles.
When Ted Cruz advocated admitting Syrian Christian refugees into the United States, because "there is no meaningful risk of Christians committing acts of terror," he was not denying that Christians--notably anti-abortion activists wi

No matter what you are wearing or what kind of cash you are hoping to spend, Berlin has something for you. Part of its charm though, is the what the locals refer to as the inside scene. Touristy areas are not for the real Berliners, most of whom are actually not from Berlin. Hackesher Markt and Mitte are full of fun bars and restaurants, but the insiders can be found in Friedrichshain, Kreuzberg, and Neukölln.

What is Leoman's knowledge regarding Dassem Ultor, and how does it connect to the ongoing events in the narrative
------------correct----------------------
sequence involving Karsa getting into Moraval Keep is a joy to read, from the little Falah’d to the way Karsa insists to Samar Dev that his name is not Toblakai and then the way he breaks into the Keep single-handedly through iron doors. Fantastic. I love him!
But… I don’t love the fight between him and the demon. Occasionally Bill has talked about fights and whatnot that jar him out of the reading—well, this was my moment. The sheer amount of damage? The fact that the creature is so enormously destructive? I know Karsa took down the two Hounds and we know he is some sort of super human but it just seems too much.
There is really dark humour in the line: “He’s probably raping someone!” given what we know of Karsa and his history.
And I do love the scene as Karsa emerges from the keep, and his statement that this massive demon was nothing important.
This is simply stunning and I love the ideas therein: “They could be naught but celestial roads, the paths walked by the dragons of the deep, and Elder Gods and the blacksmiths with suns for eyes who hammered stars into life; and the worlds spinning round those stars were simply dross, cast-offs from the forges, pale and smudged, on which crawled creatures preening with conceit.”
A slug? With roe? *feels nauseous*
Teehee—we’ve already discussed the possible identity now of Dassem Ultor, and here we’re having a little re-emphasis of the matter:
“No, my friend, the First Sword did not die, and he lives still.”
“Then where is he?”
“Where doesn’t matter. You should ask: Who is he? Ask that, Corabb Bhilan Thenu’alas, and I will give you answer.”
How does Leoman know? And what does he know about Dassem Ultor’s ascension?
Smiles is really prejudiced against the Seti, isn’t she? It’s a little foul to read since it smacks of racism.
There are lots of little hints about Bottle starting – the fact he knows Leoman is heading for Y’Ghatan, possibly those lizards? Aha, yes, the lizards are used for spying. I remember from Memories of Ice.
So Bottle has the potential to draw on more warrens than Quick Ben? Is this because of the Eres’al? And where did Quick Ben get his power from? Dear Lord, it does get frustrating when we get back to the points where I am asking more questions during the reading than answering.
Another hint that the warrens are pretty unbalanced: “By warren? They shouldn’t be doing that, you know. Not now. Not here…”
Yep, those warrens are pretty messed up! Nice little cliffhanger there featuring Quick Ben and Kalam en route to Y’Ghatan—where are they now? And what chaos is in store for them. Oh, and I totally laughed at:
“The Fourteenth’s motto,” Stormy said, with a loud sigh.
“Which?” Gesler asked. “And then we leave or No heroic stands?”
“Take your pick.”
Bill’s Reaction to Chapter Three
Clearly the poem is clueing us in that Y’Ghatan is going to be of some importance and by the end of the chapter it seems the final battle between Leoman’s army and the Fourteenth will take place there. The sense of the buried past, the past that lives, is a constant theme in this series, so no surprise we see it mentioned here, but perhaps also not a coincidence that “bones” play such a role as well in this poem, considering our book’s title.
And from the tragic dignity of the poem to our resident comic relief—this cracks me up every time this discussion over the urn. And coming after our earlier introduction to these two, where we learned they were familiar with Starvald Demelain and where Telorast hissed in “reptilian fashion,” we should perhaps as Amanda says note Telorast’s desire for a body with wings.
A nice transition echo from the poem that opens to Apsalar’s view of the city: “crouched on the sun-baked clay . . . the city . . . like something dead in the night.”
I find her musings over Cutter’s naivety sad and a bit moving. Her use of his original name—Crokus—for one. The fact that he had been naïve and no longer is for another. And the way it also calls up the image of a naïve young girl on a road near her fishing town who is now a reluctant assassin who thinks herself unworthy of love. And then a few paragraphs later, equally sad is her attempt to force herself to be that assassin, uncaring and unthinking because it is what she is. And her dream of walking away into a new life.
I like the two mystery folks we get teased with in her thoughts: the final target and the one she might ask about walking away (we have met him before if you can recall someone near this city who had in fact made himself a new life by disappearing)
“You are so unsuited to be a god, Cotillion.” That has to be one of the nicest things anyone has said about him. And I think it is a great way to sum him up.
Okay, the Apsalar near-caress. Let’s have at it….
Have I mentioned before how much I love this character—Cotillion? His humanity, his compassion, his empathy. The sad way he reacts to that touch. His heavy remorse over what he has done to her. The way he can smile at the thought of her visiting an old friend.
“The east horizon was in flames with the rising of the sun.”
I also like how Apsalar is taking the initiative to find out what was going on with Mebra because Cotillion had been “shaken” by the news.
And again, you have to laugh at Telorast and Curdle’s response to the sun: “By the Abyss, there’s a sun in this world? Have they gone mad?”
I think you’re okay with where Apsalar is in the canal city. I think it’s another example of how Shadows overlay Shadows, how the warren is layered, almost like parallel dimensions sharing the same space-time.
Ruthless is right in the description of Apsalar, which is an interesting and somewhat jarring to the reader depiction coming after seeing her so sad and depressed and then so soft with Cotillion. Keeps us on our toes and reminds us these characters are multi-faceted.
Karpolan is one of the original founders of the Guild and therefore pretty high up, and, as we’ve seen in Deadhouse Gates, pretty good at what he does (he delivers the box of munitions to Fiddler at the end amidst all that madness).
There’s that city Y’Ghatan again.
And yes, those Guild rides are “hairy” indeed.
The Shadow Dance is part of the Shadow cult and yes, is connected to assassination. Think of Cotillion known as “Dancer.” Recall as well that Lostara is a Shadow Dancer.
You’re right on all points regarding Veed, Amanda.
Loved Karsa getting into the Keep. Loved the reactions outside though. Loved the exit scene. Not so much the fight itself, like Amanda, though I did enjoy one aspect of it—the very “Huge Barbarian”/Conan/Tarzan aspect of it. But let’s not go away without filing “short tail” reptile.
It’s rare I think that Erikson waxes so poetical as that description of the stars—wouldn’t mind if we had more of that throughout. This is just a beautiful passage.
Leoman’s knowledge of Dassem is certainly intriguing. It’s a bit slapsticky, but I did like the humor in Corabb’s ignorantly ironic “Blessed Dessembrae . . .” And the little throwaway “he wanders . . .” I have to admit I don’t recall if we know why or learn why Leoman knows this. Anyone?
Leoman is pretty ominous in his words I’d say. What does he have planned that makes him wonder if Corabb will follow his orders? What about those orders will seem like “madness”? What will make the Malazans “curse” the name of Y’Ghatan “for all time”? Why are his plans a “burden”? Why does he care if it is “past cursing season” with the olives?
- Leoman “the gaze seemingly fixed on the licking flames”
- Leoman “slowly nodded, eyes once more on the flames.”
- “The trail of fire.”
- “Our trail of fire.”
Another one of those nice Erikson transitions, from the fire of Leoman and Corabb to Koryk blowing on a fire, “inhaling a cloud of ashes.”
Neffarias Bred, if you recall, was an infantry “heavy” whose exploits were the thing of legend mentioned in House of Chains: “I heard he killed eighteen raiders all in one night . . . Killed fifty raiders they say . . .”

Close of play tomorrow is another deadline for objections and we urge those who have not objected and feel they want to, do it today or before 17:00 tomorrow. The planning team should accept objections up to the committee date but the 23rd is another admin point, they will acknowledge your objection.
- Be objective not subjective or it will be disregarded.
- Stick to planning issues, not views and depreciation.
- Evidence based objections are useful so back up your facts.
There is a small number of residents who have expressed interest in presenting at the planning committee hearing. We need to coordinate that response, if you wish to present to the committee then please contact us on email@example.com we can then coordinate our objection

Welcome to the Malazan Re-read of the Fallen! Every post will start off with a summary of events, followed by reaction and commentary by your hosts Bill and Amanda (with Amanda, new to the series, going first), and finally comments from Tor.com readers. In this article, we’ll cover Chapter Three of The Bonehunters by Steven Erikson (TB).
A fair warning before we get started: We’ll be discussing both novel and whole-series themes, narrative arcs that run across the entire series, and foreshadowing. Note: The summary of events will be free of major spoilers and we’re going to try keeping the reader comments the same. A spoiler thread has been set up for outright Malazan spoiler discussion.
Apsalar wonders why if Shadowthrone wanted Mebra dead because of the Nameless Ones or possibly the old Shadow cult. She thinks the last person on her list of targets will be the hardest, tries to convince herself to simply do it, then thinks maybe she’ll talk to someone nearby about how to walk away. Cotillion appears and they discuss Mebra, Telorast and Curdle, Edgewalker, her future, and her upcoming visit.
Telorast and Curdle fade at the sunrise, much to their dismay. Apsalar finds the Pardu women and Gral from the night before. Upon her return, Telorast and Curdle tell her someone was in her room, though their description is a bit confusing.
Apsalar and the two ghosts return to Mebra’s place. The Pardu women arrive, Apsalar incapacitates them, and learns their employer is Karpolan Demesand of the Trygalle Trade Guild. The Pardu woman says they are returning from Y’Ghatan and they were trying to purchase information from Mebra. Apsalar explains what happened then knocks her out. They find tablets hidden under a pavestone with Mebra’s notes.
Samar Dev and Karsa have gone out to Moraval Keep. Karsa says he’ll go in himself when nobody can say the last time they saw any Malazans in the Keep.
Karsa breaks open the huge, locked iron doors of the keep, stunning his witnesses.
Inside, Karsa finds a pit where something massive had been spiked down. He is attacked by a giant short-tailed lizard and they fight.
Outside, Samar Dev, Captain Inashan and others wonder at the noise within. Samar Dev tells them the Keep is ancient and had been filled with strange mechanisms.
Karsa kills the lizard.
Karsa appears outside, looking terrible. He tells them he didn’t see any Malazans and leaves.
Corabb and Leoman discuss their destination: Y’Ghatan. Leoman corrects Corabb’s mistaken believe that Dassem Ultor died there and tells him Dassem ascended and is Dessembrae, The Lord of Tragedy. He adds he is a “reluctant god” and is in constant flight and/or possibly eternally hunting. He asks Corabb if he will stand beside him no matter what he commands and Corabb says yes.
Fiddler talks magic with Bottle. They find Nil and Nether engaged in a ritual crossing through Hood’s Gate to look for Sormo E’nath and dead Wickans from the Chain of Dogs. Bottle senses something and jumps in the ritual and finds them being upbraided by their mother. Bult’s ghost appears and tells them “we do not belong here” then leaves.
Quick Ben, Kalam, Stormy and others have gotten lost in the Imperial Warren (or out of it). They’re being followed by something out of Chaos. They wait and see lots of massive things “filling the sky” and Quick says it’s time to go.
Amanda’s Reaction to Chapter Three
“Bones in the Wall” – Author Unknown. “And yet I remain, with all my kin…” Deliberate mystery at the start of Chapter Three!
Ha! I can just imagine Curdle taking on a chamber pot as her new body in error. Erikson likes to throw in these little clues: “You want something alive. Really alive, with legs that work. Or wings…”
I find it curious that Apsalar considers Cutter to be naive. I mean, I do as well, but I also think you can level the same charge at Apsalar herself. Sure she has some of the memories of Cotillion, but that doesn’t mean she has any true experience. Certainly when it comes to love and feelings she seems very naive. I can’t help thinking, in fact, that Cutter and Apsalar are incredibly well suited, if only they could realise it.
Hmm, now we find out that Apsalar’s task is to kill a succession of people listed by Shadowthrone and Cotillion, “with the final target the most challenging of all…” And someone she feels no enmity towards. I guess we should start wondering who that person is. Has Erikson already started dropping little clues and I’m just missing them?
I like this: “Still, what made a god decide to kill some lowly mortal? The minor irritation of a stone in a moccasin. The slap of a branch on a wooded trail.” We’ve seen a number of occasions now where a mortal has proved to be much, much more than gods expect them to be.
We’ve spoken about the odd relationship between Apsalar and Cotillion before—here there is more to fuel it: “She reached up with one hand and brushed the line of his jaw, the gesture close to a caress. She caught the sudden intake of his breath, the slight widening of his eyes, but he would not look at her.” This seems to have hints of romance about it.
I am glad that Cotillion feels remorse for what he did to Apsalar—it was a grotesque action and he continues to use her (although with her assent), but he clearly have intentions of leaving her in a better position. I feel so sorry for her.
Ooh! Who is it that Apsalar is going to drop in on? I’m sure I’ll find out very soon, but my curiosity is piqued now!
It is interesting that someone is spying on Apsalar and trying to find out about her while she does the same to other people. Obviously she has been noted. A big, black, hairy demon with fangs and claws wearing boots, hmm? No one immediately comes to mind with that description, although my memory could be failing me.
Just as an aside and a possible discussion point, even when given a description of what a person or creature looks like, I generally don’t keep a visual of them in my head. I tend to gloss over the description. I know some people read really visually and can see everything represented down to the last hair and blade of grass, but I struggle to do this. Which kind of reader are you?
Speaking of not being able to picture things, I’m struggling to understand what this shadowy aqueduct thing is and where it has come from! Were I Apsalar (and you can be damn sure I’m glad I’m not!) I would be asking more questions about where it’s come from and who provided it… Certainly Apsalar isn’t able to pin down Telorast or Curdle on it:
“What is this?”
“We don’t know.”
“It is from the Shadow Realm, isn’t it? It has to be. Otherwise I would be unable to see it.”
“Oh yes. We think. Don’t we, Telorast?”
“Absolutely. Or not.”
It sounds like they might be in a different fragment of Kurald Emurlahn (dear God, that is difficult to spell!), especially because they see some Tiste Edur. Oh, and who is the person dead in the canal? And are they dead in the real world or in the shadow realm? Am I reading too much into all of this? Except…mention of “a most delicious throne”… Curious. The Shadow Throne—the real one? Or another throne? (Especially because Telorast says: “You have lost your mind. Naught but pain. Suffering. Affliction…” Hey, if it’s affliction is there finally a warren/throne, etc for the Crippled God? I mean, he is in the deck of dragons now… Maybe he has an associated dragon!)
Telorast and Curdle aren’t very good at keeping up appearances, are they? “Women, like you. Like us, too. I forgot. Yes, we’re all women here…”
Apsalar is badass. Needs to be said. She takes down these two Pardu caravan guards effortlessly, and is utterly ruthless in extracting information. Nasty. And then there is the point where the Pardu guard thinks that Apsalar will kill her after she’s given over her info.
Ooh! The Trygalle Trade Guild make another appearance.
Apsalar is actually referred to here as Shadow Dancer—I guess this is some kind of master assassin?
So the opening poem mentioned Y’Ghatan and

What type of agreement have Aubameyang's representatives reportedly reached with Real Madrid
------------correct----------------------
Spain, [but] I do not know when.
"I cannot say [where] because I do not know how things are, but I have more family links to Madrid than Barcelona. And, yes, I like Real Madrid a little more than Atletico."
A recent report from Spanish newspaper AS claimed that Aubameyang's representatives have already spoken to Real Madrid officials and agreed on a pre-contract agreement ahead of the summer window.
All is needed now, it would seem, is for Florentino Perez to cough up to required €100m to sign him. While Real Madrid certainly have spent that kind of money in the past, they may have to generate some funds through player sales first.
Second blow for Dortmund
The quotes come at a bad time for Dortmund manager Thomas Tuchel, who has had to deal with Mats Hummels's alleged request to join their Bundesliga rivals Bayern Munich in the summer.
Dortmund officially confirmed the request on their official website but claimed that no transfer fee had been agreed with Bayern and have since confirmed their (unknown) asking price is non-negotiable.
"We named our price and that is non-negotiable," Watzke told Suddeutschen Zeitung. "They either match our asking price or the deal is off."
Hummels was jeered by large portions of theWestfalenstadion during Saturday's 5-1 win over Wolfsburg while some fans also displayed a banner instructing the centre-back to leave sooner rather than later.

ll-bearing system that pulls out a silver tongue. A fighter or a chunk of a knife comes from the previous Marine Les George.
This is an attractive knife that will pull you within the moment you’re taking it out of the package. It shimmers like a blade, and once placed quite seven inches, it will desire. The edition focuses on Dmitry Sinkevich. It is massive and stylish.
Its ascendant was a large knife, strictly during a container. For an oversized factory-made piece, this is often more worthy than the trendy adoption name. The flipping action is impressive, lets it set out quick, and therefore the sheer size and stone-washed titanium handle that just about shines makes it a monster during a dark alley.
This knife was designed by Todd Rexford. It is Elmax chrome steel, .156 “thick a three.5” drop purpose blade. It has a sharp and high-quality blade. This ZT blade includes a tungsten element DLC blackwash end, a flipper, and a swish ambidextrous one-handed gap cavity ball-carrying system.
It has a Titanium handle. It is 4.7 “off, has a blackwash finish, notched texturing for a secure grip, a frame lock, and a lanyard hole. This ZT knife has a side-to-side reversible metal pocket clip mounted on the end of the hinge. It weighs 5.8 ounces.
There are many kinds of zero-tolerance blades. Men and women can keep the knives within the pockets through paracords, cut folks off sunken cars, and quickly cut pockets because they need to run out of ammunition for AR-15s and still have hostility. So they should have the best zt knife for self defense.

Overall the Sony FE 24-105mm f/4 G OSS is an obvious choice in the Sony lineup. It may not be able to touch the center quality of the Sony FE 24-70mm f/2.8 GM but the border quality is surprisingly high for such a lens - at least when stopping down to f/5.6. Lateral CAs are moderate.
+ Consistently sharp at all focal lengths, + Fast, silent autofocus, + Relatively compact and lightweight, + Impressively resistant to flare
Autofocus failure in AF-C on the Alpha 9
I recently am a convert to the Sony line of cameras and lenses. I had a Canon 24-105 f4L before on my old setup and picked this lens up as soon as I got my A7RIII. I am very happy with the accurate AF, light and compact form factor, quiet AF, and OSS in low light shots.

“Brother Derek won from 4.5 furlongs to 9 furlongs, so I’d expect his progeny to be equally versatile. He has passed on plenty of size so far and has even put some size into the smaller mares we have bred to him. The foals have great shoulders, deep girths, and very strong hind legs. He gets foals with very good bone and a very intelligent eye and head.”
|Divine Park, photo by Joy Gilbert|
Divine Park is a son of Empire Maker’s half brother Chester House, who died young but sired 13% stakes winners from foals and got runners on all surfaces. Divine Park was one of his most talented runners, clocking 1:32 3/5 in the Westchester (gr. III) before beating Commentator in the Met Mile (gr. I).
According to Ben, Divine Park has nice foals out of mares by With Approval, Canadian Frontier, Afternoon Deelites, Elusive Quality, Mazel Trick, Tiznow, Red Ransom, Royal Academy, Indian Charlie, Eastern Echo, Came Home, Ghazi, Gilded Time, Chimes Band, Storm Bird, and Cape Town.
“Divine Park stamps his foals very well. They have that very smooth top line that he has, with a tremendous depth of girth and classic shoulder. They’re terrifically well balanced horses, and they have that same intelligent head and eye as their sire which I just love.
“I would expect them to be 'second half of the season' 2-year-olds that really start to excel over the classic distances as 3-year-olds, and be able to perform on all surfaces.”
I asked Ben who he thought would end up the better sire, and he gave me a politician's answer: “Hopefully it’ll be a dead heat for champion first crop sire!” So I pressed him on it, and I think he's giving the slightest nod to Brother Derek, but obviously he thinks highly of them both. It should be fun seeing how they go later this year...

What should I look for when buying an AR Rifle?
What should I look for when buying an AR rifle? That’s a really good question! Besides the fact that they both shoot bullets, ARs are about as different from other guns as they can get. It is for that reason that I decided to do today’s post on this subject. This subject is wildly debated and has often led to disagreements among even the best of friends. Everyone seems to have their own idea and I am no exception. The difference is that I will try to cover some of the things that many do seem to agree on. If you are getting ready to buy your first AR rifle, then this would be a good place to start, as for looking up information and knowing what you should be looking for.
Like I said, everyone has their own opinion on these just what you should looking for. The first things you need to ask yourself is exactly what do you intend to use it for? Self-defense, Hunting, SHTF, or something else? This is an important question because it defines the requirements for the rifle. If you are planning on using it for self-defense then you are looking at needing it for close in fighting and not trying to hit a deer at 300 yards. For close in, you will want a shorter barrel for maneuvering in tight places. If you are looking at using it in a situation where the target is less than 10 yards away such as in a house, then you won’t need to worry about barrel twist. But if you are looking for a good midrange weapon, then you will want to pay attention to it. A 1 in 9 twist is a good average twist rate for shooting at targets up to 200 yards, but after that you will want to look at a different rate. The Twist rate of 1 in 9 is the spiraling in the barrel that makes the bullet twist one full revolution for every 9 inches it travels while it is in the barrel. This spinning action helps the bullet to travel straighter and stays accurate. You can over compensate for the bullet and then you have issues. The 1:9 is recommended for a round with a 55 Grain bullet weight. Whereas a 1:7 or 1:8 would work well for a 62 or 77 grain weight. There is a lot of science behind this, but just look at the bullet weight to know what Twist rate you need.
The next thing about the barrel is be sure that it is Chrome lined. This will make the barrel last longer and be easier to clean. It is a small detail but a very important one. You will also see some listed as having a “Chromalloy” barrel interior. This is not the same a being chrome plated, it is just a marketing ploy, so keep your eye on the ball and get one with a chrome plated interior barrel. You will be glad you did. Again, this is just my opinion and others may vary. I know that there are a ton of them on the market that do not have this and are often less expensive than the ones that do. Another thing to be aware of is the term “Mil-Spec”. It means that the parts used in the rifle are of the same size and dimensions as those used by the military. This is important because it means that replacing worn parts and upgrading can be easily done because everything fits without the need to modify things for your weapon. This often refers to things like pin sizes, etc. Being able to mix and match parts to create th

What was the cost of the three motor mounts purchased from Napa and how long has the user had them without issues
------------correct----------------------
40. Does anyone have any experience using these mounts. The reviews on Amazon for one brand - were not very good.
Has anyone had any positive experience with a aftermarket motor mount?
I purchased the 3 motor mounts for my 2000 from Napa 3 years ago for $113. So far, no problems

What are the features of the ZT0770CF folding knife that make it suitable for self-defense
------------correct----------------------
Zt knife, also known as the zero-tolerance knife, was made for a specific motive. We know that military personnel, police officers, first responders, firefighters, and other life-saving professionals need the superior quality and best zt knife for self defense.
Here are some zt knives for self defense given below:
ZT0770CF Folding Knife:
This is an original and award-winning knife. The blade is 3.5″ long. The blade fans are more interested in it. The 0770CF offers a slightly smaller, more streamlined version of the style and performance.
It is a carbon fiber handle. It’sIt’s a comfortable feeling that is less strategic or aggressive than their other options. It’sIt’s a loving, stone-washed look that makes it sound mutes for work around the home or office.
It carries the impressive ELMAX tool steel, which has been hardened once the ZT0770CF becomes the edge of a razor. It may hold through many powerful programs. It is thin and fresh. It is a beautiful back pocket knife. So it is easy to carry for self-defense.
Les George’sGeorge’s ZT0900 zt Knife:
You are introduced to a slatey body that appears to catch the sunshine just like the rocks of the sun. The scales are made from titanium, and that they create the S35VN steel simply to open or not thus loose that it flops freely.
Every line is supposed to slide into your hand and mix in along with your employment, either to alleviate fatigue once you slash on the carpet or simply to waste time carrying a beautiful piece of hickory. This small flipper may be a manual open with a sleek cavity ba

Sean trained at École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq, a world renowned school for physical theatre. Over the two years he trained in devised theatre, ensemble building, character development, mask work, mime, object manipulation / puppetry and clowning, among a vast array of other training. Sean also trained at East 15 Acting School on the BA Hons / Acting & Stage Combat degree graduating in 2011, gaining specialist skills in nine different weapon sets alongside an extensive acting program, in contemporary and classical work and practitioners. Sean works as a performer, director and choreographer, and regularly leads workshops and courses for theatre companies across the UK, Europe and Asia. His approach to theatre follows predominantly from his training at Lecoq, with the body and with a playful curiosity, exploring the space and how the body moves within it. In his courses he hopes to open up a deeper understanding of performance technique, emotional engagement, physicality and the exploration of all aspects of life through theatre and to share his deep profound love of what he does with others.

What does Bruce Symington mean by the phrase 'he drank from the cop Kool Aid jug' in relation to his son
------------correct----------------------
honest here, he says a pound of pot, which is quite a bit, but not huge. It is about the size of a loaf of bread. So he would turn in his son to the cops, who would then charge junior, drag him through the courts, give him a criminal record, basically throw the entire weight of the state into messing up this guy’s entire life, all for a pound of pot. Sad, really, when you think of it. He drank from the cop Kool Aid jug so deeply that he would do that to his own son.
Actually, public sentiment is shifting dramatically in the opposite direction, and I assert that not one parent in a hundred would do that to their child. Just the heartless, unthinking ones.

ducting more advanced multi-dimensional lookups based on multiple criteria. However, to use these more advanced functions of Excel, learning how to use the MATCH function effectively is crucial.
Check our US - Data Science Programs
Using MATCH functions in Excel
Now, let us learn how to use MATCH functions in Excel to locate numeric values or even text.
In this first example, the values in the range A1 to A3 are arranged in ascending order.
So, if we wish to locate the matching value for ‘25’, we will be using this MATCH formula in Excel:
This will be what is returned: 2
This will return the value ‘2’ as that is the position of the row containing the closest number to ‘25’. There was no exact match, so 22 was identified by the function as it has a lower value than ‘25’ and because we used ‘1’ as our Match_type. Additionally, we have used ‘A1:A3’ as our Lookup_array as this is the range containing the numbers. If the array was sorted in descending order, we would have to use ‘-1’ in this function for the Match_type.
In the case of a negative approximate match type, a number bigger than ‘22’ or any Lookup_value would be identified. However, if we use ‘-1’ and the array is not in descending order, the matching function will return an error.
In the next example, let us try to locate the position of ‘Cookies’ among the three words occupying the cells inside the range of A1:A3.
This will be the formula:
When we locate text, we must keep the Lookup_value inside “ ” to allow the function to figure out the position of the text. The case does not matter in MATCH functions, as even without using “Cookies” (C in uppercase), and by using “cookies” (c in lowercase), we can still find the matching position. However, MATCH functions can be combined with an EXACT function to make the function case-sensitive and accurately find the exact combination of alphabets.
Here is one final example where we will try locating the location of the approximate value or the next larger number in an array sorted in descending order.
In this example, we will use 35 as the Lookup_value.
This will be the formula:
This will be what is returned: 1
40 will be chosen as the matching value as it is greater than 35 even though both 40 and 30 are the closest to 35. Also, if there are any issues with the order of the array or in the data, the MATCH function will return “#N/A”.
Now, let us take the instance where we do not numerically declare the Lookup_value in the formula. We can also choose to mention the position of another cell to use that value as the active Lookup_value in the formula. Since the value occupying D1 is 35, we can also use this formula:
Here, just D1 is replacing “35” in the formula.
Read our Popular US - Data Science Articles
Learning the MATCH function is essential to use any INDEX MATCH formula in Excel for advanced lookups. Also, it is essential to remember that MATCH functions in Excel only work on the text with a maximum of 255 characters. In the case of duplicate values, the function retrieved the first match. For EXACT matches or when the Match_type is “0”, you can also use the wildcards in the Lookup_value.
The MATCH function is crucial for Data Science and is extensively used with the INDEX function. A top-tier Data Analytics Program from Upgrad is bound to take you places in your career.
If you are already pursuing a career in this field but in a dilemma about what to do next in your career, you can find some of the best mentorship services by industry experts in upGrad.
If you’d like to gain in-depth knowledge of Python, we recommend upGrad’s online Professional Certificate Program in Data Science and Business Analytics from the University of Maryland, which is one of the top 100 global universities in the world.
1. Is the MATCH function case-sensitive?
No, the MATCH function is not case-sensitive.
2. Can the MATCH function be used both horizontally and vertically?
Yes, it can be used horizontally and vertically if combined with the INDEX function.
3. Are MATCH functions capable of retrieving values and not just row positions?
MATCH functions can also retrieve associated (related) values or specific values if combined with other functions.

What factors should someone consider before purchasing an AR rifle
------------correct----------------------
What should I look for when buying an AR Rifle?
What should I look for when buying an AR rifle? That’s a really good question! Besides the fact that they both shoot bullets, ARs are about as different from other guns as they can get. It is for that reason that I decided to do today’s post on this subject. This subject is wildly debated and has often led to disagreements among even the best of friends. Everyone seems to have their own idea and I am no exception. The difference is that I will try to cover some of the things that many do seem to agree on. If you are getting ready to buy your first AR rifle, then this would be a good place to start, as for looking up information and knowing what you should be looking for.
Like I said, everyone has their own opinion on these just what you should looking for. The first things you need to ask yourself is exactly what do you intend to use it for? Self-defense, Hunting, SHTF, or something else? This is an important question because it defines the requirements for the rifle. If you are planning on using it for self-defense then you are looking at needing it for close in fighting and not trying to hit a deer at 300 yards. For close in, you will want a shorter barrel for maneuvering in tight places. If you are looking at using it in a situation where the target is less than 10 yards away such as in a house, then you won’t need to worry about barrel twist. But if you are looking for a good midrange weapon, then you will want to pay attention to it. A 1 in 9 twist is a good average twist rate for shooting at targets up to 200 yards, but after that you will want to look at a different rate. The Twist rate of 1 in 9 is the spiraling in the barrel that makes the bullet twist one full revolution for every 9 inches it travels while it is in the barrel. This spinning action helps the bullet to travel straighter and stays accurate. You can over compensate for the bullet and then you have issues. The 1:9 is recommended for a round with a 55 Grain bullet weight. Whereas a 1:7 or 1:8 would work well for a 62 or 77 grain weight. There is a lot of science behind this, but just look at the bullet weight to know what Twist rate you need.
The next thing about the barrel is be sure that it is Chrome lined. This will make the barrel last longer and be easier to clean. It is a small detail but a very important one. You will also see some listed as having a “Chromalloy” barrel interior. This is not the same a being chrome plated, it is just a marketing ploy, so keep your eye on the ball and get one with a chrome plated interior barrel. You will be glad you did. Again, this is just my opinion and others may vary. I know that there are a ton of them on the market that do not have this and are often less expensive than the ones that do. Another thing to be aware of is the term “Mil-Spec”. It means that the parts used in the rifle are of the same size and dimensions as those used by the military. This is important because it means that replacing worn parts and upgrading can be easily done because everything fits without the need to modify things for your weapon. This often refers to things like pin sizes, etc. Being able to mix and match parts to create th

What's the best-supported Linix distro to install for AMD Threadripper?
I know that upstream Kernel 4.15 has support for it, so that narrows it down a bit to the more bleeding-edge options or rolling distributions like Arch. I wonder if others have experience with that.6
I spent $2500 on a paperweight.

honest here, he says a pound of pot, which is quite a bit, but not huge. It is about the size of a loaf of bread. So he would turn in his son to the cops, who would then charge junior, drag him through the courts, give him a criminal record, basically throw the entire weight of the state into messing up this guy’s entire life, all for a pound of pot. Sad, really, when you think of it. He drank from the cop Kool Aid jug so deeply that he would do that to his own son.
Actually, public sentiment is shifting dramatically in the opposite direction, and I assert that not one parent in a hundred would do that to their child. Just the heartless, unthinking ones.

------------question-----------------------
What are the key features and qualities mentioned by the user about the lens they purchased
------------correct----------------------
nd had a hard time finding reviews on this. This is a great “everyday” lens. I have this on my camera most of the time as it is a great range for most occasions.
I haven't had a chance to use it extensively yet, but I was able to take it out for a landscape shoot this past weekend and was very pleased with the sharpness and contrast. I would like it better if it was a little faster lens of around 2.8 for better bokeh.
I bought this lens because I wanted two things: a step up in quality from my Sony 28-70mm kit lens and a greater focal range for travel. Although this lens adds quite some weight to your bag, the results are worth it.
Good Build Quality, Great Picture Quality
Focussing performance much better than the A711 kit lens and the increased zoom range is useful. I have not found the additional weight to be an issue. Images are very sharp with good colour balance.
bought this lens to go with my new A7iii, a great match, great images
Good general use Lens which is light enough to carry
Got the lens in the mail along with brand new Sony A7iii, and headed off to a national volleyball tourney. Photos are tremendous! Not sure if it's the camera, the lens, or (probably) both.
I Bought this lens recently but have been using almost daily.
This is a great walk around lens. Crisp and a joy to use.

------------question-----------------------
What should participants wear and bring to the course
------------correct----------------------
me. Please consider whether you could do this; if you are in any doubt, consult a medical practitioner.
As part of the course content, your tutor may record your image for initial and ongoing assessment purposes. You are entitled to decline to participate in the recording of your image.
Are there any other costs? Is there anything I need to bring?
Wear comfortable shoes and clothing that you can relax and move freely in. A notebook and pen is useful.
When I've finished, what course can I do next?
You can enrol onto Acting: improvers; Improvisation or take one of our Stanislavski courses.
Sean trained at École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq, a world renowned school for physical theatre. Over the two years he trained in devised theatre, ensemble building, character development, mask work, mime, object manipulation / puppetry and clowning, among a vast array of other training. Sean also trained at East 15 Acting School on the BA Hons / Acting & Stage Combat degree graduating in 2011, gaining specialist skills in nine different weapon sets alongside an extensive acting program, in contemporary and classical work and practitioners. Sean works as a performer, director and choreographer, and regularly leads workshops and courses for theatre companies across the UK, Europe and Asia. His approach to theatre follows predominantly from his training at Lecoq, with the body and with a playful curiosity, exploring the space and how the body moves within it. In his courses he hopes to open up a deeper understanding of performance technique, emotional engagement, physicality and the exploration of all aspects of life through theatre and to share his deep profound love of what he does with others.

------------question-----------------------
What characteristics do the foals of Brother Derek possess according to the text
------------correct----------------------
n’s Holiday, Unbridled’s Song, Marquetry, and Include.
“Brother Derek won from 4.5 furlongs to 9 furlongs, so I’d expect his progeny to be equally versatile. He has passed on plenty of size so far and has even put some size into the smaller mares we have bred to him. The foals have great shoulders, deep girths, and very strong hind legs. He gets foals with very good bone and a very intelligent eye and head.”
|Divine Park, photo by Joy Gilbert|
Divine Park is a son of Empire Maker’s half brother Chester House, who died young but sired 13% stakes winners from foals and got runners on all surfaces. Divine Park was one of his most talented runners, clocking 1:32 3/5 in the Westchester (gr. III) before beating Commentator in the Met Mile (gr. I).
According to Ben, Divine Park has nice foals out of mares by With Approval, Canadian Frontier, Afternoon Deelites, Elusive Quality, Mazel Trick, Tiznow, Red Ransom, Royal Academy, Indian Charlie, Eastern Echo, Came Home, Ghazi, Gilded Time, Chimes Band, Storm Bird, and Cape Town.
“Divine Park stamps his foals very well. They have that very smooth top line that he has, with a tremendous depth of girth and classic shoulder. They’re terrifically well balanced horses, and they have that same intelligent head and eye as their sire which I just love.
“I would expect them to be 'second half of the season' 2-year-olds that really start to excel over the classic distances as 3-year-olds, and be able to perform on all surfaces.”
I asked Ben who he thought would end up the better sire, and he gave me a politician's answer: “Hopefully it’ll be a dead heat for champion first crop sire!” So I pressed him on it, and I think he's giving the slightest nod to Brother Derek, but obviously he thinks highly of them both. It should be fun seeing how they go later this year...

------------question-----------------------
What should you consider when choosing between iron sights and optics for your weapon
------------correct----------------------
e weapon that is perfect for you is one of the big draws of the AR platform and will continue to be for a long time to come. If you are unsure if it is Mil-Spec then ask the seller questions, if they do not know then take the time to research it on the web. It is important to know what you are buying.
The next section that I want to touch on is the sighting system you plan to use. Are you going to use iron sights or optics? If you are going to use optics, then there are a few things to know before you layout your hard earned money. Again, we need to go back to what the weapon is intended to be used for. If you are using it for self-defense, then iron sights should be all you need. Heck, if they are close enough, you could just point it at them and probably get the job done. There is no point in wasting your money on fancy optics if you are only going to be using it in close quarters situations. Now, on to optics… the ugly truth is that all of those cheap optics and scopes on the market are just junk and you would be better not to waste your money on them. If you can’t afford a good set then use the iron sights until you can afford to get a good one. Think about this, the optics are the interface between you and the weapon. If it fails, you fail and if old man Murphy has anything to say about it, it will fail at the worst possible time! Do not risk your life or that once in a lifetime shot on a cheap piece of junk. Make it a point to get you a good one. If you are looking to be shooting, in the 1 to 200 yard range, then you will want an optic (or scope) that has something like a 1 to 4 zoom on it to help you make those long shots while still allowing you to make the close ones as well. If however you are going after those really long shots that are 2 to 700 yards then you will want something that can bring those really hard shots into focus with maybe a 4+ zoom and a wide aperture. After all, you can’t shoot what you can’t see.
When you go to buy your first AR weapon, try to bring along someone who has one and knows what to look for. You will be glad you did. These are just a few of the things to look for and as I can put together more information for you I will be adding new articles on this subject. Let me say again, that this is just my opinion and others may vary. In any case do your homework and learn as much about the AR platform and brands as you can. One of my favorite websites on this subject is www.AR15.com. It is a really great site and has a forum of experienced users to answer any question that you might have. Just remember that just because someone says they are an expert, it doesn’t mean that they are. Look for trends. If someone says that something is good and a lot of people agree than it is probably a safe bet that they are, and I would question if a single person says something is good and the others disagree. Like I said, look for trends and patterns on what is good and bad. Most of these folks will be more than glad to answer your questions and help you along your way.
Well, that is it for today, and I hope I may have passed along a little information that you can use when you set out to purchase your first AR rifle. Until next time, keep on prepping

e weapon that is perfect for you is one of the big draws of the AR platform and will continue to be for a long time to come. If you are unsure if it is Mil-Spec then ask the seller questions, if they do not know then take the time to research it on the web. It is important to know what you are buying.
The next section that I want to touch on is the sighting system you plan to use. Are you going to use iron sights or optics? If you are going to use optics, then there are a few things to know before you layout your hard earned money. Again, we need to go back to what the weapon is intended to be used for. If you are using it for self-defense, then iron sights should be all you need. Heck, if they are close enough, you could just point it at them and probably get the job done. There is no point in wasting your money on fancy optics if you are only going to be using it in close quarters situations. Now, on to optics… the ugly truth is that all of those cheap optics and scopes on the market are just junk and you would be better not to waste your money on them. If you can’t afford a good set then use the iron sights until you can afford to get a good one. Think about this, the optics are the interface between you and the weapon. If it fails, you fail and if old man Murphy has anything to say about it, it will fail at the worst possible time! Do not risk your life or that once in a lifetime shot on a cheap piece of junk. Make it a point to get you a good one. If you are looking to be shooting, in the 1 to 200 yard range, then you will want an optic (or scope) that has something like a 1 to 4 zoom on it to help you make those long shots while still allowing you to make the close ones as well. If however you are going after those really long shots that are 2 to 700 yards then you will want something that can bring those really hard shots into focus with maybe a 4+ zoom and a wide aperture. After all, you can’t shoot what you can’t see.
When you go to buy your first AR weapon, try to bring along someone who has one and knows what to look for. You will be glad you did. These are just a few of the things to look for and as I can put together more information for you I will be adding new articles on this subject. Let me say again, that this is just my opinion and others may vary. In any case do your homework and learn as much about the AR platform and brands as you can.

What is the chronological range of the Central Middle Sabaic inscriptions
------------correct----------------------
Corpus of Central Middle Sabaic Inscriptions (work in progress)
The Central Middle Sabaic inscriptions are those Middle Sabaic texts originating from the areas of Mārib, Ṣirwāḥ, some cities of the Jawf, and the Yemeni highlands north of Ṣanʿāʾ (P. Stein's Zentrale Dialekte). Chronologically, they are set in the period from the late 4th century BC up to the 3rd century AD. The linguistic border dividing the Central and the Raydanite inscriptions lies in the area of Ġaymān and Noʿḍ. Although this frontier is not clearly defined, at present only the Ġaymān texts have been included in the Central Sabaic corpus.
The inscriptions whose provenance is not univocally ascertained and which do not provide clear Central Sabaic features have been also included in this corpus.

th a history of attacks on clinics providing abortion services--promoted or committed violent acts, but rather his words reflected the fact that terrorism is a subjective category that is inherently about what the other guys do. Cruz posits that Christians do not commit acts of terror because if Christians commit them as acts motivated by their faith, those acts might step over the line of what is legal--and should be condemned as such when they occur--but because their cause is grounded in principles that he shares, those acts would not constitute terrorism.
In the second Republican debate, Carly Fiorina offered the most passionate anti-abortion call to action among the candidates with her testimony regarding a video showing the vivisection of a live fetus--a video that it turned out does not exist in the form she suggested. Fiorina, more than any other candidate, should not have been surprised if it turns out that Robert Lewis Dear was inspired by her words. Abortion has long been an irresolvable chasm in our politics. A woman's right to chose and a fetus's status as a living being set those on each side on a seemingly irreconcilable collision course. If one believes that a fetus is from conception a life endowed with all of the rights of any human being, then what Fiorina claimed to have seen is an abomination that might well in the minds of extremists warrant the action that Robert Lewis Dear--like others before him--took to act against the slaughter of innocents. Instead of deflecting blame for the actions that her words might have incited, perhaps Fiorina should have been true to her convictions and stood with a man who by all appearances put his own life on the line in response to rhetoric similar to her words of passion.
If we are going to use the language of terrorism, we have to be careful to apply it consistently. We cannot apply different standards because a person is Christian or because they are white, as some felt the New York Times did in its description of Robert Lewis Dear as "a gentle loner who occasionally unleashed violent acts towards neighbors and women he knew." Given the current usage of the term, Dear should be labeled a terrorist if he did what he appears to have done. But we should not be surprised if doing so, in our current political landscape, turns out to be an unproductive step.
What Robert Lewis Dear did was terrifying and barbaric, and it is becoming increasingly clear that his actions were inspired by the anti-abortion meme. But it is not useful to label any crazy person who does horrific things a terrorist, however much the old definitions might fit. We have to be cognizant in this debate that the global war on terror changed everything, particularly the language of terrorism. Terrorism is no longer simply a word used to describe a political tactic, but has become a moral absolute, a designation of evil. It may be that the word has lost its salience for the application to events of "domestic terrorism" that lack an organized, systematic framework, and to which the anti-terrorism tools and tactics do not apply.
In his speech declaring the global war on terror, President George Bush assigned equal moral culpability to those who commit acts of terror and those who support them. Translated into our domestic landscape, this suggests that an acknowledgement by Carly Fiorina or Ted Cruz that their rhetoric may have inspired Dear's actions could imply culpability for a terrorist act. Even if that is exactly what their political antagonists would love to see, it would only take us farther down a slippery slope in a year when political rhetoric has already begun to test the limits of what a democracy can tolerate. Instead, we need to move in the opposite direction, and those who assign these labels might begin to consider language that reframes the issue in a way that allows people to confront the linkages between incendiary language in the public square and the violence that can ensue, without falling into the trap of debating who is a terrorist and who is not.

To the Editor:
These cops live in some sort of fantasy construct that sort of resembles reality, but not quite. Witness the letter from former (thank goodness) police officer Rick Dalton published in the Feb. 16 Almaguin News, “Former officer weighs in on pot debate.”
He calls out a serving officer who advocates for legalization of cannabis, ignoring the fact that LEAP (Law Enforcement Against Prohibition) has been saying the same things for years, and ignoring also the courage that it takes for said officer to speak out. He says a bunch of nasty things about said officer, and ends by saying that he, like all good people would turn in their child for a cannabis offense.
Now, let’s be

How TSG can help:
Biostimulants are emerging as an increasingly important sector in the crop protection industry, and the path to market is challenging due to different states having their own rules. In the US, TSG has extensive experience working with biostimulants at the state level. In Europe, recently a new regulation has been approved which lays down the rules on EU fertilising products. The European parliament adopts it under the Regulation (EC) No. 2019/1009 and will apply from Jul 2022.

Excel is one of the most commonly used data science and data analytics tools. The MATCH function is one of the many useful features this powerful software offers. By enabling MATCH functions in your current position (or any cell of your choosing), you can locate values you are looking for inside a table, column, or row.
You can locate the exact value you are looking for and also the closest value to it. Additionally, one can also choose to use the INDEX function to reflect the value occupying the position of the row the function brings up or even certain associated values. Just by using MATCH functions in Excel on their own, you can identify the exact row the matching (or partially matching) value occupies inside a given range.
With MATCH functions, you can manually provide the input value for identifying a matching value in the array and allow the function to automatically locate matching values for whatever is the current value occupying your reference cell. For example, if you use the cell D4 for reference in the matching function instead of using a number or value inside the function, the function will automatically identify the row number occupied by a similar or identical value as D4. As soon as you change the value of D4, the function will again immediately retrieve the row number of the next closest value.
MATCH functions in Excel work with both alphabets and numbers while not being uppercase or lowercase sensitive, thus identifying the same combination of alphabets regardless of their case. This function is crucial for different automated workflows (Excel-based) and, in general, analytics.

The syntax for MATCH functions is:
=MATCH (lookup_value, lookup_array, match_type)
For example, this is a MATCH function: =MATCH(E4,C2:C12,1)
Now, let’s break down the syntax of the MATCH formula in Excel.
- Lookup_value: This value is compulsory and must be the exact value or a value close to what you want to find in an array. For example, if you are looking for a number close to 2000 (i.e. 2010) inside a range, you should use 2000 as a reference point for your matching function. You can also use wildcards such as ‘*’ and ‘?’ when looking for partial matches. The question mark helps match a single character, while the asterisk helps match a sequence or combination of characters.
- Lookup_array: This will represent the target range (or array) for finding the position of the matching value. For example, C2 to C20 is a range that will be represented as “C2:C20” inside the function.
- Match_type: This argument is optional in the MATCH formula in Excel but is set to 1 by default. There are three options to choose from when it comes to the Match_type.
- 0: This is used for an exact matching function where you want to find the position of the value in an unstructured array. An unstructured array would be a range where the values are not sorted in ascending or descending order.
- 1: This is the default value of a MATCH function if you do not put any value as the Match_type. This will command the function to find the position of either the exact value or the next smallest value. For instance, if you use Lookup_value as ‘25’, in a range of cells having the values 11, 23, 32, 41, the function will bring up the cell’s position having ‘23’ inside. However, the array or the range must be sorted in ascending order (depending on their values).
- -1: This is used for locating the exact value or the next largest value in an array. When using ‘-1’, the range must be sorted in descending values.

If you wish to allow the automatic retrieval of the value of a matched position (row), you can use the INDEX function along with the MATCH function. MATCH functions in Excel identify the position of the match while INDEX functions retrieve the value occupying that row in an array.
This is how an INDEX function is used with a MATCH function:
With the help of the INDEX MATCH formula in Excel, you can also implement a two-way lookup function, like so:

2016 has been the year when your most annoying Eeyore friend has been proven right, over, and over again.
Reward them for their prescience and counsel that everything is terrible, with this map, which shows how likely (or unlikely) it is that you will survive World War Three.
The map, created by 'Would I Survive a Nuke'.com, comes with several options that allow users to personalise their demise.
One can choose the location, and what type of weapon of mass destruction will be used in the conflict.

Based on his gung-ho comments regarding the use of nuclear weapons, president-elect Donald Trump appears to be emulating the 'mad man Richard Nixon' strategy of deterrence, by speaking about the use of thousands of warheads so brazenly, that enemies of the US will fear he might actually do it.
According to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons the nine nuclear countries have a combined 15,000 nuclear weapons at their disposal.
Trump's acquisition of the launch codes for 6,970 warheads, makes this map not only a morbid reminder that we are all one miscommunication away from a fiery death, but also a useful tool for assessing just how bad that death may be.
The graphics show exactly what areas will suffer first, second, and third degree burns respectively in the event of a nuclear strike on any chosen location.
The site doesn't log any kind of location data, so there are no statistics for the most searched nuclear targets.

How does Carly Fiorina's rhetoric about abortion relate to the actions taken by Robert Lewis Dear
------------correct----------------------
th a history of attacks on clinics providing abortion services--promoted or committed violent acts, but rather his words reflected the fact that terrorism is a subjective category that is inherently about what the other guys do. Cruz posits that Christians do not commit acts of terror because if Christians commit them as acts motivated by their faith, those acts might step over the line of what is legal--and should be condemned as such when they occur--but because their cause is grounded in principles that he shares, those acts would not constitute terrorism.
In the second Republican debate, Carly Fiorina offered the most passionate anti-abortion call to action among the candidates with her testimony regarding a video showing the vivisection of a live fetus--a video that it turned out does not exist in the form she suggested. Fiorina, more than any other candidate, should not have been surprised if it turns out that Robert Lewis Dear was inspired by her words. Abortion has long been an irresolvable chasm in our politics. A woman's right to chose and a fetus's status as a living being set those on each side on a seemingly irreconcilable collision course. If one believes that a fetus is from conception a life endowed with all of the rights of any human being, then what Fiorina claimed to have seen is an abomination that might well in the minds of extremists warrant the action that Robert Lewis Dear--like others before him--took to act against the slaughter of innocents. Instead of deflecting blame for the actions that her words might have incited, perhaps Fiorina should have been true to her convictions and stood with a man who by all appearances put his own life on the line in response to rhetoric similar to her words of passion.
If we are going to use the language of terrorism, we have to be careful to apply it consistently. We cannot apply different standards because a person is Christian or because they are white, as some felt the New York Times did in its description of Robert Lewis Dear as "a gentle loner who occasionally unleashed violent acts towards neighbors and women he knew." Given the current usage of the term, Dear should be labeled a terrorist if he did what he appears to have done. But we should not be surprised if doing so, in our current political landscape, turns out to be an unproductive step.
What Robert Lewis Dear did was terrifying and barbaric, and it is becoming increasingly clear that his actions were inspired by the anti-abortion meme. But it is not useful to label any crazy person who does horrific things a terrorist, however much the old definitions might fit. We have to be cognizant in this debate that the global war on terror changed everything, particularly the language of terrorism. Terrorism is no longer simply a word used to describe a political tactic, but has become a moral absolute, a designation of evil. It may be that the word has lost its salience for the application to events of "domestic terrorism" that lack an organized, systematic framework, and to which the anti-terrorism tools and tactics do not apply.
In his speech declaring the global war on terror, President George Bush assigned equal moral culpability to those who commit acts of terror and those who support them. Translated into our domestic landscape, this suggests that an acknowledgement by Carly Fiorina or Ted Cruz that their rhetoric may have inspired Dear's actions could imply culpability for a terrorist act. Even if that is exactly what their political antagonists would love to see, it would only take us farther down a slippery slope in a year when political rhetoric has already begun to test the limits of what a democracy can tolerate. Instead, we need to move in the opposite direction, and those who assign these labels might begin to consider language that reframes the issue in a way that allows people to confront the linkages between incendiary language in the public square and the violence that can ensue, without falling into the trap of debating who is a terrorist and who is not.

What options does Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang have for a potential move at the end of the season
------------correct----------------------
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has dropped the strongest suggestion yet that he will be looking to leave Borussia Dortmund at the end of the season.
The striker has been in sensational form, scoring 40 goals in 46 appearances across the campaign, and has naturally attracted the attention of some of Europe's biggest clubs.
Even a reported asking price of €100million has not put the likes of Manchester United off, who, amongst others, seem determined to take the Gabon international away from the Black and Yellow this summer.

But Aubameyang has already suggested that he would reject the Premier League for a move to Spain and has now reiterated his desire.
With Barcelona, Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid to choose from, it is no wonder that the 26-year-old fancies a transfer to La Liga, but it is the Bernabeu that is most appealing to him.

Affinity to Los Blancos
While stating that he is currently committed to a long-term contract with Borussia Dortmund, Aubameyang struggled to hold back his affinity to Zinedine Zidane's side.
"I am focused on finishing the season with my team. We do not know what can happen, but I have a contract until 2020," he told Cadena Cope.
"I've always said it would be a dream for me to play in

Corpus of Central Middle Sabaic Inscriptions (work in progress)
The Central Middle Sabaic inscriptions are those Middle Sabaic texts originating from the areas of Mārib, Ṣirwāḥ, some cities of the Jawf, and the Yemeni highlands north of Ṣanʿāʾ (P. Stein's Zentrale Dialekte). Chronologically, they are set in the period from the late 4th century BC up to the 3rd century AD. The linguistic border dividing the Central and the Raydanite inscriptions lies in the area of Ġaymān and Noʿḍ. Although this frontier is not clearly defined, at present only the Ġaymān texts have been included in the Central Sabaic corpus.
The inscriptions whose provenance is not univocally ascertained and which do not provide clear Central Sabaic features have been also included in this corpus. Up to now, this collection comprises more than 1600 inscriptions, most of them from the CIH collection and from the CSAI Corpus of Inscriptions from the

han cash!
No matter what you are wearing or what kind of cash you are hoping to spend, Berlin has something for you. Part of its charm though, is the what the locals refer to as the inside scene. Touristy areas are not for the real Berliners, most of whom are actually not from Berlin. Hackesher Markt and Mitte are full of fun bars and restaurants, but the insiders can be found in Friedrichshain, Kreuzberg, and Neukölln.

Pretty smooth, ain’t he.
Apparently Mr. Saban is unconcerned about the possible fallout from a minor rules infraction. Just a minor advantage in recruiting. No worries.
Can you blame him? He’s running an extremely unethical oversigning regime that has Alabama being exposed via investigative reports in the Wall Street Journal… yet his Alabama superiors couldn’t care less.
All they want is wins.
Calling the University of Alabama a community college level joke isn’t fair to community colleges. At least most of them are simply trying to provide legitimate education.
Sooooo…. you’ve been very vocal here. Yet outside of pointing out the deficiencies what might be ” your” plan as to how we re-calibrate college athletics with regard to these blatant shortcomings?
Oversigning, secondary violations….When we have a program that is as speaky clean as they can be this is very frustrating.
In comes Bama with the Auburn and Ohio State defense.. and the NCAA will probably let it go. It doesn’t involve a player taking money away from the NCAA, so what’s the big deal?
Wouldn’t you love to hear the conversation between the compliance office at Alabama and Nick Saban? That is if there ever IS any conversation.
Obviously, having the death penalty hanging over Alabama’s head, still isn’t enough to rein in the Great Sabana.
I am sure a lot of shrugging of shoulders going on at Alabama over this one.
I doubt there is any concern at

------------question-----------------------
What does the text suggest about the subjective nature of labeling incidents as terrorism
------------correct----------------------
The editors' question was specific to how the Department of Justice would interpret Robert Lewis Dear's assault and murders, but it mirrored the debate that springs up immediately after these events about what constitutes a terrorist act vs. other forms of violence. Terrorism is generally defined as a tactic using violence or the threat of violence to inspire fear in pursuit of a political goal.
The question raised by the editors points to the difficulty--and in their view the importance--of how we label incidents like this. Because of the prominence of Planned Parenthood as a political issue raised by Republicans over the past several months, people quickly looked to see how the Republican presidential candidates would respond to the question the editors raised. Mike Huckabee, a candidate with impeccable anti-abortion credentials who won the Iowa caucuses in 2008, held down the straightforward, call-a-spade-a-spade, end of the spectrum when he declared that Dear's action was domestic terrorism. Carly Fiorina and Ted Cruz hunkered down at the other end of the spectrum. Cruz took pains to suggest all manner of alternative explanations for why Dear did what he did--most remarkable of which was that Dear may be a transgendered leftist activist--in a strikingly defensive effort to deflect any culpability from his own anti-Planned Parenthood vitriol of the past few months. The queen of anti-Planned Parenthood vitriol, Carly Fiorina, launched a leftists-at-the-gates counter offensive.
Newspaper editors know better than most--their jobs are literally about parsing words and meaning after all--that terrorism is a highly subjective term. The use of the term terrorist today cannot be divorced from the language of the global war on terrorism (GWOT) declared by the United States in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. One of the consequences of the GWOT is that it has provided a vocabulary that has come to be used by governments across the globe to label one's opponents in morally absolute terms, and in turn for sanctioning all manner of state action against them. Vladimir Putin rose quickly to our defense after the 9/11 attacks, as he saw in our determination to go to war half-way around the world under the banner of the GWOT a post-hoc justification for his own wars against Chechen separatists.
There are myriad other examples of how the language of terrorism has since been used. Bashir al-Assad used the language of terrorism in the early days of civil protests against his regime, as he quickly labeled real and manufactured events as the work of terrorists to justify the tenor of the regime's own violent assault against its own people. China has used the language of the GWOT to justify its suppression of Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang and Buddhists in Tibet. In Myanmar, the Buddhist majority and Muslim minority has struggled for the linguistic upper hand, as each has labeled the other side as the terrorists. Terrorism is both a tactic utilized against a state or other more powerful adversary, and a propaganda tool, in the GWOT context, used by those in power for the labeling of their enemy and the justification for means used to defeat it.
Each of these circumstances suggests the subjective nature of the terrorist label. Terrorism is what we call what the other guys do--the bad guys. That suggests why Ted Cruz cannot allow the murders in Colorado to be labeled an act of terrorism. While Robert Lewis Dear may (or may not) have been inspired by Cruz's history of vitriolic attacks on the evils of Planned Parenthood, Ted Cruz does not view his own rhetoric as extreme. To Ted Cruz, the other guys are the extremists, while he is a strict constitutionalist advocating for what he believes would be the mainstream of American thought if America had not deviated from its founding principles.
When Ted Cruz advocated admitting Syrian Christian refugees into the United States, because "there is no meaningful risk of Christians committing acts of terror," he was not denying that Christians--notably anti-abortion activists wi

sequence involving Karsa getting into Moraval Keep is a joy to read, from the little Falah’d to the way Karsa insists to Samar Dev that his name is not Toblakai and then the way he breaks into the Keep single-handedly through iron doors. Fantastic. I love him!
But… I don’t love the fight between him and the demon. Occasionally Bill has talked about fights and whatnot that jar him out of the reading—well, this was my moment. The sheer amount of damage? The fact that the creature is so enormously destructive? I know Karsa took down the two Hounds and we know he is some sort of super human but it just seems too much.
There is really dark humour in the line: “He’s probably raping someone!” given what we know of Karsa and his history.
And I do love the scene as Karsa emerges from the keep, and his statement that this massive demon was nothing important.
This is simply stunning and I love the ideas therein: “They could be naught but celestial roads, the paths walked by the dragons of the deep, and Elder Gods and the blacksmiths with suns for eyes who hammered stars into life; and the worlds spinning round those stars were simply dross, cast-offs from the forges, pale and smudged, on which crawled creatures preening with conceit.”
A slug? With roe? *feels nauseous*
Teehee—we’ve already discussed the possible identity now of Dassem Ultor, and here we’re having a little re-emphasis of the matter:
“No, my friend, the First Sword did not die, and he lives still.”
“Then where is he?”
“Where doesn’t matter. You should ask: Who is he? Ask that, Corabb Bhilan Thenu’alas, and I will give you answer.”
How does Leoman know? And what does he know about Dassem Ultor’s ascension?
Smiles is really prejudiced against the Seti, isn’t she? It’s a little foul to read since it smacks of racism.
There are lots of little hints about Bottle starting – the fact he knows Leoman is heading for Y’Ghatan, possibly those lizards? Aha, yes, the lizards are used for spying. I remember from Memories of Ice.
So Bottle has the potential to draw on more warrens than Quick Ben? Is this because of the Eres’al? And where did Quick Ben get his power from? Dear Lord, it does get frustrating when we get back to the points where I am asking more questions during the reading than answering.
Another hint that the warrens are pretty unbalanced: “By warren? They shouldn’t be doing that, you know. Not now. Not here…”
Yep, those warrens are pretty messed up! Nice little cliffhanger there featuring Quick Ben and Kalam en route to Y’Ghatan—where are they now? And what chaos is in store for them. Oh, and I totally laughed at:
“The Fourteenth’s motto,” Stormy said, with a loud sigh.
“Which?” Gesler asked. “And then we leave or No heroic stands?”
“Take your pick.”
Bill’s Reaction to Chapter Three
Clearly the poem is clueing us in that Y’Ghatan is going to be of some importance and by the end of the chapter it seems the final battle between Leoman’s army and the Fourteenth will take place there. The sense of the buried past, the past that lives, is a constant theme in this series, so no surprise we see it mentioned here, but perhaps also not a coincidence that “bones” play such a role as well in this poem, considering our book’s title.
And from the tragic dignity of the poem to our resident comic relief—this cracks me up every time this discussion over the urn. And coming after our earlier introduction to these two, where we learned they were familiar with Starvald Demelain and where Telorast hissed in “reptilian fashion,” we should perhaps as Amanda says note Telorast’s desire for a body with wings.
A nice transition echo from the poem that opens to Apsalar’s view of the city: “crouched on the sun-baked clay . . . the city . . . like something dead in the night.”
I find her musings over Cutter’s naivety sad and a bit moving. Her use of his original name—Crokus—for one. The fact that he had been naïve and no longer is for another. And the way it also calls up the image of a naïve young girl on a road near her fishing town who is now a reluctant assassin who thinks herself unworthy of love. And then a few paragraphs later, equally sad is her attempt to force herself to be that assassin, uncaring and unthinking because it is what she is. And her dream of walking away into a new life.
I like the two mystery folks we get teased with in her thoughts: the final target and the one she might ask about walking away (we have met him before if you can recall someone near this city who had in fact made himself a new life by disappearing)
“You are so unsuited to be a god, Cotillion.” That has to be one of the nicest things anyone has said about him. And I think it is a great way to sum him up.
Okay, the Apsalar near-caress. Let’s have at it….
Have I mentioned before how much I love this character—Cotillion? His humanity, his compassion, his empathy. The sad way he reacts to that touch. His heavy remorse over what he has done to her. The way he can smile at the thought of her visiting an old friend.
“The east horizon was in flames with the rising of the sun.”
I also like how Apsalar is taking the initiative to find out what was going on with Mebra because Cotillion had been “shaken” by the news.
And again, you have to laugh at Telorast and Curdle’s response to the sun: “By the Abyss, there’s a sun in this world? Have they gone mad?”
I think you’re okay with where Apsalar is in the canal city. I think it’s another example of how Shadows overlay Shadows, how the warren is layered, almost like parallel dimensions sharing the same space-time.
Ruthless is right in the description of Apsalar, which is an interesting and somewhat jarring to the reader depiction coming after seeing her so sad and depressed and then so soft with Cotillion. Keeps us on our toes and reminds us these characters are multi-faceted.
Karpolan is one of the original founders of the Guild and therefore pretty high up, and, as we’ve seen in Deadhouse Gates, pretty good at what he does (he delivers the box of munitions to Fiddler at the end amidst all that madness).
There’s that city Y’Ghatan again.
And yes, those Guild rides are “hairy” indeed.
The Shadow Dance is part of the Shadow cult and yes, is connected to assassination. Think of Cotillion known as “Dancer.” Recall as well that Lostara is a Shadow Dancer.
You’re right on all points regarding Veed, Amanda.
Loved Karsa getting into the Keep. Loved the reactions outside though. Loved the exit scene. Not so much the fight itself, like Amanda, though I did enjoy one aspect of it—the very “Huge Barbarian”/Conan/Tarzan aspect of it. But let’s not go away without filing “short tail” reptile.
It’s rare I think that Erikson waxes so poetical as that description of the stars—wouldn’t mind if we had more of that throughout. This is just a beautiful passage.
Leoman’s knowledge of Dassem is certainly intriguing. It’s a bit slapsticky, but I did like the humor in Corabb’s ignorantly ironic “Blessed Dessembrae . . .” And the little throwaway “he wanders . . .” I have to admit I don’t recall if we know why or learn why Leoman knows this. Anyone?
Leoman is pretty ominous in his words I’d say. What does he have planned that makes him wonder if Corabb will follow his orders? What about those orders will seem like “madness”? What will make the Malazans “curse” the name of Y’Ghatan “for all time”? Why are his plans a “burden”? Why does he care if it is “past cursing season” with the olives?
- Leoman “the gaze seemingly fixed on the licking flames”
- Leoman “slowly nodded, eyes once more on the flames.”

------------question-----------------------
What are the main components of the MATCH function's syntax in Excel
------------correct----------------------
Excel is one of the most commonly used data science and data analytics tools. The MATCH function is one of the many useful features this powerful software offers. By enabling MATCH functions in your current position (or any cell of your choosing), you can locate values you are looking for inside a table, column, or row.
You can locate the exact value you are looking for and also the closest value to it. Additionally, one can also choose to use the INDEX function to reflect the value occupying the position of the row the function brings up or even certain associated values. Just by using MATCH functions in Excel on their own, you can identify the exact row the matching (or partially matching) value occupies inside a given range.
With MATCH functions, you can manually provide the input value for identifying a matching value in the array and allow the function to automatically locate matching values for whatever is the current value occupying your reference cell. For example, if you use the cell D4 for reference in the matching function instead of using a number or value inside the function, the function will automatically identify the row number occupied by a similar or identical value as D4. As soon as you change the value of D4, the function will again immediately retrieve the row number of the next closest value.
MATCH functions in Excel work with both alphabets and numbers while not being uppercase or lowercase sensitive, thus identifying the same combination of alphabets regardless of their case. This function is crucial for different automated workflows (Excel-based) and, in general, analytics.

The syntax for MATCH functions is:
=MATCH (lookup_value, lookup_array, match_type)
For example, this is a MATCH function: =MATCH(E4,C2:C12,1)
Now, let’s break down the syntax of the MATCH formula in Excel.
- Lookup_value: This value is compulsory and must be the exact value or a value close to what you want to find in an array. For example, if you are looking for a number close to 2000 (i.e. 2010) inside a range, you should use 2000 as a reference point for your matching function. You can also use wildcards such as ‘*’ and ‘?’ when looking for partial matches. The question mark helps match a single character, while the asterisk helps match a sequence or combination of characters.
- Lookup_array: This will represent the target range (or array) for finding the position of the matching value. For example, C2 to C20 is a range that will be represented as “C2:C20” inside the function.
- Match_type: This argument is optional in the MATCH formula in Excel but is set to 1 by default. There are three options to choose from when it comes to the Match_type.
- 0: This is used for an exact matching function where you want to find the position of the value in an unstructured array. An unstructured array would be a range where the values are not sorted in ascending or descending order.
- 1: This is the default value of a MATCH function if you do not put any value as the Match_type. This will command the function to find the position of either the exact value or the next smallest value. For instance, if you use Lookup_value as ‘25’, in a range of cells having the values 11, 23, 32, 41, the function will bring up the cell’s position having ‘23’ inside. However, the array or the range must be sorted in ascending order (depending on their values).
- -1: This is used for locating the exact value or the next largest value in an array. When using ‘-1’, the range must be sorted in descending values.

If you wish to allow the automatic retrieval of the value of a matched position (row), you can use the INDEX function along with the MATCH function. MATCH functions in Excel identify the position of the match while INDEX functions retrieve the value occupying that row in an array.
This is how an INDEX function is used with a MATCH function:
With the help of the INDEX MATCH formula in Excel, you can also implement a two-way lookup function, like so:

Spain, [but] I do not know when.
"I cannot say [where] because I do not know how things are, but I have more family links to Madrid than Barcelona. And, yes, I like Real Madrid a little more than Atletico."
A recent report from Spanish newspaper AS claimed that Aubameyang's representatives have already spoken to Real Madrid officials and agreed on a pre-contract agreement ahead of the summer window.
All is needed now, it would seem, is for Florentino Perez to cough up to required €100m to sign him. While Real Madrid certainly have spent that kind of money in the past, they may have to generate some funds through player sales first.
Second blow for Dortmund
The quotes come at a bad time for Dortmund manager Thomas Tuchel, who has had to deal with Mats Hummels's alleged request to join their Bundesliga rivals Bayern Munich in the summer.
Dortmund officially confirmed the request on their official website but claimed that no transfer fee had been agreed with Bayern and have since confirmed their (unknown) asking price is non-negotiable.
"We named our price and that is non-negotiable," Watzke told Suddeutschen Zeitung. "They either match our asking price or the deal is off."
Hummels was jeered by large portions of theWestfalenstadion during Saturday's 5-1 win over Wolfsburg while some fans also displayed a banner instructing the centre-back to leave sooner rather than later.

Overall the Sony FE 24-105mm f/4 G OSS is an obvious choice in the Sony lineup. It may not be able to touch the center quality of the Sony FE 24-70mm f/2.8 GM but the border quality is surprisingly high for such a lens - at least when stopping down to f/5.6. Lateral CAs are moderate.
+ Consistently sharp at all focal lengths, + Fast, silent autofocus, + Relatively compact and lightweight, + Impressively resistant to flare
Autofocus failure in AF-C on the Alpha 9
I recently am a convert to the Sony line of cameras and lenses. I had a Canon 24-105 f4L before on my old setup and picked this lens up as soon as I got my A7RIII. I am very happy with the accurate AF, light and compact form factor, quiet AF, and OSS in low light shots.

What inspired Britton Matthews to create the website WouldISurviveANuke.com
------------correct----------------------
ite is Google.
Speaking to indy100, the creator of the interactive map, Britton Matthews, explained how it evolved from a disagreement with his boss:
WouldISurviveANuke.com actually started as a joke. I developed it by myself over a weekend five years ago. I am a software developer in Washington state. During lunch one day, my project manager and I got into this discussion about if a nuke dropped on Seattle would we survive.
Matthews lives in Tukwila, just outside Seattle:
My project manager at the time was this loud mouth, cocky, always right kind of guy. He did have a sense of humour though and didn’t mind us poking fun at him. So after this argument I went home and over the weekend made the site just to prove him wrong. I came back Monday and showed him he was wrong. What was humorous to me and my colleges was that someone would go so out of their way to just prove this project manager wrong. We all had a good laugh.
In addition to telling you how bad your burns will be in the nuclear fall out, the website also throws up helpful tips in the form of gallows humour. Matthews explained his inspiration for the jokes:
I am a big fan of the old computer games from Sierra On Line (Kings Quest, Space Quest - all those games from the 80s where you had to type in commands). I decided to pay homage to these games by putting in funny death messages, similar to those games, in my site. Josh Mandel, a comedian and game designer who wrote 'Space Quest 6', 'Freddy Pharkas Frontier Pharmacist', and 'Callahan's crosstime saloon' contributed by also writing some of the death messages.
Matthews said that the point of the map, despite the jokes, was to prove that "there really is no surviving a nuclear war".

o improve yield, all the way to understanding the best practices and market trends.
How TSG can help:
Biostimulants are emerging as an increasingly important sector in the crop protection industry, and the path to market is challenging due to different states having their own rules. In the US, TSG has extensive experience working with biostimulants at the state level. In Europe, recently a new regulation has been approved which lays down the rules on EU fertilising products. The European parliament adopts it under the Regulation (EC) No. 2019/1009 and will apply from Jul 2022.

ite is Google.
Speaking to indy100, the creator of the interactive map, Britton Matthews, explained how it evolved from a disagreement with his boss:
WouldISurviveANuke.com actually started as a joke. I developed it by myself over a weekend five years ago. I am a software developer in Washington state. During lunch one day, my project manager and I got into this discussion about if a nuke dropped on Seattle would we survive.
Matthews lives in Tukwila, just outside Seattle:
My project manager at the time was this loud mouth, cocky, always right kind of guy. He did have a sense of humour though and didn’t mind us poking fun at him. So after this argument I went home and over the weekend made the site just to prove him wrong. I came back Monday and showed him he was wrong. What was humorous to me and my colleges was that someone would go so out of their way to just prove this project manager wrong. We all had a good laugh.
In addition to telling you how bad your burns will be in the nuclear fall out, the website also throws up helpful tips in the form of gallows humour. Matthews explained his inspiration for the jokes:
I am a big fan of the old computer games from Sierra On Line (Kings Quest, Space Quest - all those games from the 80s where you had to type in commands). I decided to pay homage to these games by putting in funny death messages, similar to those games, in my site. Josh Mandel, a comedian and game designer who wrote 'Space Quest 6', 'Freddy Pharkas Frontier Pharmacist', and 'Callahan's crosstime saloon' contributed by also writing some of the death messages.
Matthews said that the point of the map, despite the jokes, was to prove that "there really is no surviving a nuclear war".

nd had a hard time finding reviews on this. This is a great “everyday” lens. I have this on my camera most of the time as it is a great range for most occasions.
I haven't had a chance to use it extensively yet, but I was able to take it out for a landscape shoot this past weekend and was very pleased with the sharpness and contrast. I would like it better if it was a little faster lens of around 2.8 for better bokeh.
I bought this lens because I wanted two things: a step up in quality from my Sony 28-70mm kit lens and a greater focal range for travel. Although this lens adds quite some weight to your bag, the results are worth it.
Good Build Quality, Great Picture Quality
Focussing performance much better than the A711 kit lens and the increased zoom range is useful. I have not found the additional weight to be an issue. Images are very sharp with good colour balance.
bought this lens to go with my new A7iii, a great match, great images
Good general use Lens which is light enough to carry
Got the lens in the mail along with brand new Sony A7iii, and headed off to a national volleyball tourney. Photos are tremendous! Not sure if it's the camera, the lens, or (probably) both.
I Bought this lens recently but have been using almost daily.
This is a great walk around lens. Crisp and a joy to use.

What is the deadline for submitting objections to the planning team
------------correct----------------------
Close of play tomorrow is another deadline for objections and we urge those who have not objected and feel they want to, do it today or before 17:00 tomorrow. The planning team should accept objections up to the committee date but the 23rd is another admin point, they will acknowledge your objection.
- Be objective not subjective or it will be disregarded.
- Stick to planning issues, not views and depreciation.
- Evidence based objections are useful so back up your facts.
There is a small number of residents who have expressed interest in presenting at the planning committee hearing. We need to coordinate that response, if you wish to present to the committee then please contact us on email@example.com we can then coordinate our objection

------------question-----------------------
What issues regarding ethics and recruiting practices are raised in the investigation of Nick Saban and the University of Alabama
------------correct----------------------
They walk down a hallway towards each other.
Their eyes meet.
Without breaking stride, the visitor nods and says, “Barry, how ‘ya doin’? Mark Ingram’s goin’ pro.”
They pass, still smiling.
Filed under Nick Saban Rules, Recruiting
Pretty smooth, ain’t he.
Apparently Mr. Saban is unconcerned about the possible fallout from a minor rules infraction. Just a minor advantage in recruiting. No worries.
Can you blame him? He’s running an extremely unethical oversigning regime that has Alabama being exposed via investigative reports in the Wall Street Journal… yet his Alabama superiors couldn’t care less.
All they want is wins.
Calling the University of Alabama a community college level joke isn’t fair to community colleges. At least most of them are simply trying to provide legitimate education.
Sooooo…. you’ve been very vocal here. Yet outside of pointing out the deficiencies what might be ” your” plan as to how we re-calibrate college athletics with regard to these blatant shortcomings?
Oversigning, secondary violations….When we have a program that is as speaky clean as they can be this is very frustrating.
In comes Bama with the Auburn and Ohio State defense.. and the NCAA will probably let it go. It doesn’t involve a player taking money away from the NCAA, so what’s the big deal?
Wouldn’t you love to hear the conversation between the compliance office at Alabama and Nick Saban? That is if there ever IS any conversation.
Obviously, having the death penalty hanging over Alabama’s head, still isn’t enough to rein in the Great Sabana.
I am sure a lot of shrugging of shoulders going on at Alabama over this one.
I doubt there is any concern at

Yemeni Museums and Corpus of Inscriptions from the British Museum.
Most part of the texts comes from the region of Hamdān (jabal Riyām, al-Ḥuqqa, Ḥāz, Nāʿiṭ), and consists of dedications to local varieties of the God Tʾlb or other deities. Some of those are written on bronze, like the corpus of the tablets from ʿAmrān. Particularly relevant from the cultural point of view are an edict regulating homicide (CIH 126) and a dedication to Tʾlb which is also a political "manifesto" of a king of S¹mʿy (CIH 37). Interesting inscriptions from cities of the Jawf (al-Bayḍāʾ, as-Sawdāʾ) and from the temple of Maḥrām Bilqīs in Mārib, mainly housed in the museums of Yemen, are also included in this corpus.
This is the corpus home page. You can begin the consultation of the whole corpus by using the indexes and tools menu on the left or you can consult only one of its sub-corpora, when present, by choosing from the list below.

Airdrie Looking Beyond Indian Charlie
Written by Ian Tapp | Feb 20, 2012 |
Last year didn’t end well for Airdrie Stud—how could it when you lose a top stallion like Indian Charlie? Curious to hear how everyone at the farm is adjusting, last week I spoke with Ben Henley, who handles bloodstock services at Airdrie. Ben summed it up pretty well:
“Losing Indian Charlie was a terrible blow, not only to everybody here at the farm and his shareholders, but to the industry as a whole. He was a terrific outcross for most sire lines that are around at the moment and his best days were ahead of him. He’d been covering some outstanding books of mares the past few years and I think we’ll see his impact reflected in the success that these unraced babies will achieve. From a personal note, I will dearly miss him as he was the most kind and trustworthy character you could imagine. But we must move on. We all feel very lucky to have had the opportunity to work with such an outstanding sire as Indian Charlie.”
And in moving on, Ben and the rest of the Airdrie team are very excited about Brother Derek (TrueNicks,SRO) and Divine Park (TrueNicks,SRO), who have first crop 2-year-olds this year. Airdrie has supported both stallions with over 25 of their own mares each season, so Ben is quite familiar with their young progeny.
“We feel they both have a chance to have a real impact on the breed,” Ben said. “Hopefully they can follow in the footsteps of the barn mate they recently lost.”

What was the impact of losing the stallion Indian Charlie on Airdrie Stud and the breeding industry according to Ben Henley
------------correct----------------------
Airdrie Looking Beyond Indian Charlie
Written by Ian Tapp | Feb 20, 2012 |
Last year didn’t end well for Airdrie Stud—how could it when you lose a top stallion like Indian Charlie? Curious to hear how everyone at the farm is adjusting, last week I spoke with Ben Henley, who handles bloodstock services at Airdrie. Ben summed it up pretty well:
“Losing Indian Charlie was a terrible blow, not only to everybody here at the farm and his shareholders, but to the industry as a whole. He was a terrific outcross for most sire lines that are around at the moment and his best days were ahead of him. He’d been covering some outstanding books of mares the past few years and I think we’ll see his impact reflected in the success that these unraced babies will achieve. From a personal note, I will dearly miss him as he was the most kind and trustworthy character you could imagine. But we must move on. We all feel very lucky to have had the opportunity to work with such an outstanding sire as Indian Charlie.”
And in moving on, Ben and the rest of the Airdrie team are very excited about Brother Derek (TrueNicks,SRO) and Divine Park (TrueNicks,SRO), who have first crop 2-year-olds this year. Airdrie has supported both stallions with over 25 of their own mares each season, so Ben is quite familiar with their young progeny.
“We feel they both have a chance to have a real impact on the breed,” Ben said. “Hopefully they can follow in the footsteps of the barn mate they recently lost.”
