What are the main arguments presented by the FAA regarding the lawsuit involving City Hall and the airport land operation
------------correct----------------------
for the land to operate as such in perpetuity.
The second major argument put forward by the FAA is that a lawsuit is “unripe” ‚Äî that the matter can‚Äôt be settled in court until conflict arises. City Hall maintains that, according to contracts, if they stop operating the land as an airport, the only penalty would be for the rights to revert back to City Hall. In the lawsuit, they are seeking “declaratory relief” to determine their rights prior to litigation. Until City Hall refuses to operate the space as an airport, the FAA says, the matter should not be heard in court.
The FAA and City Hall went back and forth several times. City Hall responded to the FAA‚Äôs motion to dismiss. Last week, the FAA responded to that response. The FAA‚Äôs recent response is the last of the filings, Moutrie said. Walter will use the documents, not oral arguments, and decide whether or not to toss the suit.
But will the lack of oral arguments help City Hall‚Äôs case?
“I can’t comment on the implications of the cancellation of the hearing except to say that it’s not unusual for a federal judge to conclude that he or she does not need oral argument to decide a matter,” Moutrie said.
Officials from the U.S. Department of Justice, which is representing the FAA, declined to comment given the ongoing litigation.
The canceled hearing for the motion to dismiss was scheduled for Monday. A trial, should Walter decide not to dismiss the case, is scheduled for November

Protecting your cat from fleas goes beyond using a cat shampoo.
As we discussed earlier, cats are some of the most common victims of fleas. If cats contract fleas, they could be at risk of serious disease. Furthermore, they can spread fleas to people and pets, and even bring flea infestations to the home.
If you’re concerned about your cat and potential fleas, here are some other methods you can use to keep fleas at bay and protect your cat.
First, Protect Your Pets Accordingly
Just because cats may have a higher risk of suffering from flea infestations doesn’t mean they are the only pet at risk. All pets from dogs, rabbits, and ferrets can potentially contract fleas.
Protect your home and your pets from fleas by ensuring your pets are all protected with flea repellents and remedies.
Many veterinarians recommend flea collars for pets, but you also have the option of using topical ointments, tablets, and of course flea prevention shampoos.
Store Garbage Bins Properly

What type of dishes does the Waverly Inn offer, and how does The Lion combination differ from classic meat-and-potato cuisine
------------correct----------------------
the Waverly Inn, offers at the new spot a slightly more rustic pasta, house-made cavatelli in a Franco-Italian mix of porcini, walnuts, goat cheese and cream—comforting, rainy-day fare.
The long-gone New York the Lion aims to evoke was all about meat and potatoes. The restaurant does justice to both. Dry-aged Delmonico steak—an often-forgotten cut featuring marbled meat from the rib eye—arrives beautifully blistered, funky and thick as a book, with a pitcher of silky barnaise. Yukon Gold slices in an la carte bistro gratin are drenched in hot cream, as they should be.
DeLucie, who knows a thing or two about A-list expectations, finds inspiration in what the competition is doing, plying his audience with food typical of the other restaurant revivals. His lobster potpie—featuring hunks of the shellfish in a sauce rich with lobster stock, brandy and cream—is the sort of country-club fare you might order at the Monkey Bar (and simply too heavy for warm weather, and most modern palates). The signature burger, topped with smoked Gouda, caramelized onions, fried pork belly and a mustard sauce, is an overdressed retort to Minetta Tavern’s austere Black Label. Served with a mini jar of house-made pickles, it’s surprisingly delicious, the copious condiments complementing rather than subsuming the excellent beef underneath (from Piccinini Brothers, not Pat LaFrieda).
The chef, who runs both the sweet and savory sides of the menu, is weakest in the pastry department. His too-simple desserts—leaden apple beignets, a super-sweet banana-and-Nutella crpe—are unremarkable at best.
From the street, the Lion can be imposing behind its unmarked black facade, but offers plenty of good reasons (if not dessert) to take a chance and walk in.
Drink this: The Lion’s fine $14 drinks all have a vintage bent. Try the smooth vermouth-and-whiskey Blood & Sand.
Eat this: Asparagus with egg, artichoke fritters, burger, Delmonico steak
Sit here: The VIP table is on the balcony overlooking the dining room, this being a restaurant that values discretion.

His lobster potpie—featuring hunks of the shellfish in a sauce rich with lobster stock, brandy and cream—is the sort of country-club fare you might order at the Monkey Bar (and simply too heavy for warm weather, and most modern palates). The signature burger, topped with smoked Gouda, caramelized onions, fried pork belly and a mustard sauce, is an overdressed retort to Minetta Tavern’s austere Black Label. Served with a mini jar of house-made pickles, it’s surprisingly delicious, the copious condiments complementing rather than subsuming the excellent beef underneath (from Piccinini Brothers, not Pat LaFrieda).
The chef, who runs both the sweet and savory sides of the menu, is weakest in the pastry department. His too-simple desserts—leaden apple beignets, a super-sweet banana-and-Nutella crpe—are unremarkable at best.
From the street, the Lion can be imposing behind its unmarked black facade, but offers plenty of good reasons (if not dessert) to take a chance and walk in.
Drink this: The Lion’s fine $14 drinks all have a vintage bent. Try the smooth vermouth-and-whiskey Blood & Sand.
Eat this: Asparagus with egg, artichoke fritters, burger, Delmonico steak
Sit here: The VIP table is on the balcony overlooking the dining room, this being a restaurant that values discretion.
Conversation piece: The Lion’s impressive art collection includes Basquiat paintings and glossy David LaChapelle portraits.

What is the Delay Repay scheme and how does it relate to passenger compensation for delays
------------correct----------------------
t time —I certainly want to do it this year— a compensation commitment on which the clock starts ticking at 15 minutes.”
Southeastern said: “The specification and letting of rail contracts is a matter for government. We are focused on working with Network Rail – who are responsible for infrastructure such as the track and signalling - to deliver an improved service for passengers.
“Under our current contract with the Department for Transport, we will be investing more than £70m in better services, including refurbishing trains and stations, more employees at our stations and better quality information.
“We will now work closely with the Department for Transport and Transport for London as they develop these proposals further.
“The Delay Repay scheme offering compensation to passengers delayed by 30 mins or more is approved by the Department for Transport and hardwired into our franchise agreement. Any changes to this scheme are a matter for the Department for Transport rather than individual operators and we will wait for further information from them.
“We look at all compensation claims on a case by case basis and additional goodwill gestures are paid to passengers who are excessively delayed, held on trains for lengthy periods or who occur expenses that are within our responsibility.

for the land to operate as such in perpetuity.
The second major argument put forward by the FAA is that a lawsuit is “unripe” ‚Äî that the matter can‚Äôt be settled in court until conflict arises. City Hall maintains that, according to contracts, if they stop operating the land as an airport, the only penalty would be for the rights to revert back to City Hall. In the lawsuit, they are seeking “declaratory relief” to determine their rights prior to litigation. Until City Hall refuses to operate the space as an airport, the FAA says, the matter should not be heard in court.
The FAA and City Hall went back and forth several times. City Hall responded to the FAA‚Äôs motion to dismiss. Last week, the FAA responded to that response. The FAA‚Äôs recent response is the last of the filings, Moutrie said. Walter will use the documents, not oral arguments, and decide whether or not to toss the suit.
But will the lack of oral arguments help City Hall‚Äôs case?
“I can’t comment on the implications of the cancellation of the hearing except to say that it’s not unusual for a federal judge to conclude that he or she does not need oral argument to decide a matter,” Moutrie said.
Officials from the U.S. Department of Justice, which is representing the FAA, declined to comment given the ongoing litigation.
The canceled hearing for the motion to dismiss was scheduled for Monday. A trial, should Walter decide not to dismiss the case, is scheduled for November

Or something like that. Has anyone else gotten this nasty little bug yet? I took my laptop to the PC shop where they completely debugged it. It also had some sort of phony antivirus popup Not Desktop 2010 malware. It turns out it was in my Lynksis wireless router so I now have to password protect that. Thay are still working on it remotely as I speak. Don't know how much it will cost yet.
I have also come to the conclusion that Norton 360 is totally worthless. They're tech support is abysmal and they wanted $136 to help me debug my PC. The store guys recommended Trend which is a lot cheaper. Maybe half the price of Norton.
You don't need a pay for AV on a home computer. Put Avast Free on it. None of the AV programs are catching this nasty piece of work. Even the dedicated Malware scanners are having trouble with it. If it's the one I'm seeing a lot of lately then it's part of a rootkit, which hides itself extremely well and loads up before Windows does, and before any of your security software. Norton is still junk, but the others aren't any better in this case.
use Firefox with AdBlock and NoScript addons, will prevent most malware from having a chance to get on your pc.
There are several free AV apps that are just as good as the paid ones.
AVG and Avira are two of the more better known ones.
Either way, they will not detect what you have wrong with your PC. You have "Malware", not a "Virus". Malware is software designed to do harm. What you need is an Anti-Malware pr

------------question-----------------------
What can we infer about the character the author refers to as the General in terms of his fate in the upcoming movies
------------correct----------------------
you just know he has the title of ‘Emperor’ in his sights.
It has become his theme song in my head, so imagine how I felt when I discovered this on Youtube!!!
Thank you ‘All-Things-Geeky‘ on Youtube.
I also book marked this a while back which just sums up Domhnall Gleeson.
That scowel, knee high boots and leather gloves will never be boring. Unfortunately I think that the good General will be going down with his ship in the next movie. If he survives VIII he certainly won’t make it to the end of Episode IX.
Right, time for a long walk to make up for that glass of wine.
I’ve just realised I’ve done it again…. Panic at the Disco in the same post as One Direction!!! My daughter’s are going to kill me!!

What new feature can users utilize with the app's update regarding Google Maps and Uber
------------correct----------------------
prefer for people to continue using their app, after they recently when above and beyond to redesigned and in all likelihood, people will continue to use the main app as their go-to option, although its redesign has been met with some resistance, due mainly to the new look and feel, and that according to some users, the new location tracking has been described as overly aggressive.
It’s worth mentioning that one of the most attractive advantages that the users may end up getting from this update is the fact that due to Google Maps integration with their voice-activated assistant (Google Now), they will have the capacity of requesting an Uber from their mobile devices using nothing but their voice. So far there are no user reviews that confirm this, but one will have to wait until the roll-out in complete.
While it is said to be completely ready and in deployment stages, Google has reported that the update has started to roll globally since Jan 12th for both IOS and Android and it’s expected to be completed pretty soon.

------------answer-----------------------
the Waverly Inn, offers at the new spot a slightly more rustic pasta, house-made cavatelli in a Franco-Italian mix of porcini, walnuts, goat cheese and cream—comforting, rainy-day fare.
The long-gone New York the Lion aims to evoke was all about meat and potatoes. The restaurant does justice to both. Dry-aged Delmonico steak—an often-forgotten cut featuring marbled meat from the rib eye—arrives beautifully blistered, funky and thick as a book, with a pitcher of silky barnaise. Yukon Gold slices in an la carte bistro gratin are drenched in hot cream, as they should be.
DeLucie, who knows a thing or two about A-list expectations, finds inspiration in what the competition is doing, plying his audience with food typical of the other restaurant revivals. His lobster potpie—featuring hunks of the shellfish in a sauce rich with lobster stock, brandy and cream—is the sort of country-club fare you might order at the Monkey Bar (and simply too heavy for warm weather, and most modern palates). The signature burger, topped with smoked Gouda, caramelized onions, fried pork belly and a mustard sauce, is an overdressed retort to Minetta Tavern’s austere Black Label. Served with a mini jar of house-made pickles, it’s surprisingly delicious, the copious condiments complementing rather than subsuming the excellent beef underneath (from Piccinini Brothers, not Pat LaFrieda).
The chef, who runs both the sweet and savory sides of the menu, is weakest in the pastry department. His too-simple desserts—leaden apple beignets, a super-sweet banana-and-Nutella crpe—are unremarkable at best.
From the street, the Lion can be imposing behind its unmarked black facade, but offers plenty of good reasons (if not dessert) to take a chance and walk in.
Drink this: The Lion’s fine $14 drinks all have a vintage bent. Try the smooth vermouth-and-whiskey Blood & Sand.
Eat this: Asparagus with egg, artichoke fritters, burger, Delmonico steak
Sit here: The VIP table is on the balcony overlooking the dining room, this being a restaurant that values discretion.
Conversation piece: The Lion’s impressive art collection includes Basquiat paintings and glossy David LaChapelle portraits.

------------question-----------------------
What provocation led William King to admit he spoke the abusive words against Hugh Claxton
------------correct----------------------
This free content was Born digital and sponsored by AHRC and University of Birmingham. CC-NC-BY.
108 CLAXTON V KING
Hugh Claxton of Bedminster, co. Somerset v William King of Compton Dando, co. Somerset
November 1637 - November 1638
Claxton prosecuted King for abusive words in Thomas Taylor's alehouse in Compton Dando, Somerset, at Whitsun in 1637. King admitted to the words in the libel, but claimed that he had spoken them after asking Claxton for security for a loan he was arranging for him and that he was provoked by Claxton calling him 'base drunken rogue' and striking him in the face. He also claimed Claxton's three main witnesses were 'base idle fellows', one of whom, his servant, Thomas Price, had wounded him with a pikestaff the previous summer when trying to arrest him at Claxton's suit and sworn against him in the Court of Common Pleas. Proceedings were under way by November 1637 and the defendant's witnesses were examined by a commission led by John Burges and Barnard Atkins, gents, at the Three Tuns Inn in Bath, Somerset, on 27 March 1638. It was ordered that sentence be heard on 6 November 1638, but no further proceedings survive.
14/1cc, Defence interrogatories
1. The witnesses were warned of the penalty for perjury and bearing false witness. What was the age, occupation and condition of the witness? Where had they lived for the last ten years? How long had they known the parties?
2. Were they a relative, household servant or retainer of Claxton or King? Were they indebted to Claxton or King?
3. How much were they worth in their own goods with their debts paid?
4. In exactly what place were the pretended words in the libel spoken, and at exactly what time? What was the occasion or provocation for the words?
5. Had the witness received or been promised anything from Claxton to testify? If so what and from whom?
6. Were he and his fellow witnesses present at the time of the 'pretended speaking of the words'? What were the names of those present?
7. Did Claxton gave ill words to King prior to the 'pretended words'? What was the ill language used, and did he strike King in the face with his fist?
8. Asks Davyes and Monke whether the plaintiff's witness Thomas Price was a 'capital enemy' to King who within the last year had wounded King in the side 'with a pikestaff or some other weapon'? Had Claxton maintained Price 'in dyett and lodging and clothes and money'?
9. Were the 'pretended' words spoken at an alehouse? Were Claxton and King drinking together? How much did they drink? For how long? And 'what did the reckoning come unto'?
Signed by William Merrick.
Cur Mil II, fo. 250, Defence
1. William King spoke the words in the libel at the time and place in the libel to Hugh Claxton, 'yet the words were spoken in an alehouse while William and Hugh were drinking and tipling together with other company in the alehouse'?
2. 'That before such time as the words are pretended to be spoken by William to Hugh, Hugh would have borrowed some money of William, which William offered to lend Hugh, for as Hugh would give William security for the same.

108 CLAXTON V KING
Hugh Claxton of Bedminster, co. Somerset v William King of Compton Dando, co. Somerset
November 1637 - November 1638
Claxton prosecuted King for abusive words in Thomas Taylor's alehouse in Compton Dando, Somerset, at Whitsun in 1637. King admitted to the words in the libel, but claimed that he had spoken them after asking Claxton for security for a loan he was arranging for him and that he was provoked by Claxton calling him 'base drunken rogue' and striking him in the face. He also claimed Claxton's three main witnesses were 'base idle fellows', one of whom, his servant, Thomas Price, had wounded him with a pikestaff the previous summer when trying to arrest him at Claxton's suit and sworn against him in the Court of Common Pleas. Proceedings were under way by November 1637 and the defendant's witnesses were examined by a commission led by John Burges and Barnard Atkins, gents, at the Three Tuns Inn in Bath, Somerset, on 27 March 1638. It was ordered that sentence be heard on 6 November 1638, but no further proceedings survive.

3. How much were they worth in their own goods with their debts paid?
4. In exactly what place were the pretended words in the libel spoken, and at exactly what time? What was the occasion or provocation for the words?
5. Had the witness received or been promised anything from Claxton to testify? If so what and from whom?
6. Were he and his fellow witnesses present at the time of the 'pretended speaking of the words'? What were the names of those present?
7. Did Claxton gave ill words to King prior to the 'pretended words'? What was the ill language used, and did he strike King in the face with his fist?
8. Asks Davyes and Monke whether the plaintiff's witness Thomas Price was a 'capital enemy' to King who within the last year had wounded King in the side 'with a pikestaff or some other weapon'? Had Claxton maintained Price 'in dyett and lodging and clothes and money'?
9. Were the 'pretended' words spoken at an alehouse? Were Claxton and King drinking together? How much did they drink? For how long? And 'what did the reckoning come unto'?
Signed by William Merrick.
Cur Mil II, fo. 250, Defence
1. William King spoke the words in the libel at the time and place in the libel to Hugh Claxton, 'yet the words were spoken in an alehouse while William and Hugh were drinking and tipling together with other company in the alehouse'?
2. 'That before such time as the words are pretended to be spoken by William to Hugh, Hugh would have borrowed some money of William, which William offered to lend Hugh, for as Hugh would give William security for the same. Whereupon, and because William demanded security of Hugh, Hugh grew into a choler, and immediately called William base drunken rogue, and gave William a blow on the face; and the premises were so done before William spoke any of the pretended words against Hugh.'

What event led to the quarrel between Hugh Claxton and William King at the alehouse
------------correct----------------------
'badd them welcome, and desired their companie to sit down and drink with them', which they did. Soon after William King and John Dando arrived and they were likewise welcomed by Claxton.
They talked 'in a faire and friendlie waie without any distaste for the space of an howre', and then Hugh Claxton and William King went out together. They returned soon after 'and were then also familiar together without any offence or distaste given or taken on either side that [Priddie] perceived, and they drank each to the other'. Shortly after, Claxton said to King, Shall I have it? King 'answered him in a faire sober and civil way, Yes, if you will give me securitie. Presently thereupon Hugh Claxton grew verie cholerick, hott and angrie, and in his choler and anger called William King base drunken rogue, and withall struck him two or three blowes as hard as he could in his face; and thereupon King standing up, and forbearing Mr Claxton, Claxton clenching his hand held up his fist unto him and said, Sirra I will order you, and quoth Thomas Price there present, Aye master, I know you can do itt; whereupon William King without giving of any distaste at all *to Mr Claxton* either in word or deed that [Priddie] perceived or heard (being present all the time they were there together), departed, and went his waie.' Priddie and John Dando went homewards with [King] towards King's house, but then Priddie returned to the alehouse where he found Mr Claxton and the rest of the company. On his return, Claxton asked [him] if he heard King call him base rogue. Priddie replied, No, whereupon Claxton said, 'he would call [him] upon his oath, and throw him in jaile and keepe him there as long as he lived if [he] would not swear it'. Soon afterwards they all went homewards.
3. He well knew Thomas Price, who for about a year was well known 'to be a mortal enemie of William King'. Last Christmas, Price told him that Mr Claxton 'had the king's broad seale to serve [Priddie] up to London, and [Priddie] asked him, For what, and he replyed, For to be a witness, and [Priddie] asked him, For what business, he said, For to testifie that King did call Mr Claxton base rascall rogue; and then [he] told Price that he could testifie no such words, and that he believed there were no such words spoken. Whereupon Price told [him] that he had heard King speak it, and withal persuaded [him] to goe to London and sweare itt, and told [him] that [he] should have a horse and money to beare his charges, and ride to London fortnight before the terme and there lye gentleman like... that in hay harvest last it was commonlie *and crediblie* spoken in Compton Dando and the countrie thereabouts that Thomas Price did beate and wound King with a peeked staffe and indangered his life; and as the report went he did it when he arrested King at the suit of Mr Hugh Claxton.'
4. He well knew Thomas Price, Robert Poole and Thomas Monke, alias Mennck, who were 'people of noe credit or reputation where they live, and Thomas an ordinary common baylief, Robert Poole a young fellow of no abilitie or estate, and Thomas Monke... a man verie poore and of late had relief from the parish of Compton Dando where he liveth.' The witness thought 'they would be easily drawne to depose an untruth on their oathes'. Before going to London to testify, Poole voluntarily swore to [Priddie] that he could not testify that King called Claxton 'base rascal rogue or that he spake any other abusive terms unto him, onlie he said that all that he said at the alehouse was that Mr Claxton called King whoremaster.' The witness had also heard that Claxton gave Monke half a crown to buy him a pair of shoes to go to London to testify in this business'.

To King's defence:
3. Since last hay harvest, Price 'hath been and is a capital enimie of William King' because 'he swore a rescue against King when as to [Horsington's] knowledge, being present at the time when it was pretended the rescue was, there was no such rescue made. But to [his] knowledge in haie harvest last, in a cloase in the parish of Compton Dando, Thomas Price with a picked staffe fought with Kinge, and then at the tyme Kinge received a wound in his side; and [he] verily believeth Price gave him the wound'. On this occasion, Price had come to arrest King at Mr Claxton's suit.
4. Thomas Price and Thomas Monke, alias Mennck were well known as men 'of little or noe credit or reputation... of poore condicon'. Monke had recently taken parish relief.

To King's defence:
3. He well knew Thomas Price, and since last hay harvest 'about midsummer', Price had been King's enemy, where he fought with King, in a meadow of King's mother's in Compton Dando, 'and there with a picked staffe did grievouslie beate and wound Kinge and indangered his life at the time, which [Browne] plainly saw, being near unto the ground when *he used him soe*.' On this occasion, Price had come to arrest King at Mr Claxton's suit. Since then it was well known that King and Price were enemies.
4. Thomas Price and Thomas Monke, alias Mennck were well known as poor men, 'of mean rank or condition'. Last year Monke had taken parish relief. Both were 'of no credit or reputacon amongst their honest neighbours but accompted and reputed for base people.'

I’ve heard from one student that Windows Movie Maker may have trouble importing the downloaded internet video files. Dr Andy recommends the K-Lite Codec pack which will add support for playing most video types (but might nag you to edit your Windows Registry, ugh).
The other option is to convert the videos you downloaded to AVI, which Movie Maker can open- you can use MPEG stream clip to export to AVI – or google around a bit for free avi converters (there are online tools and downloadable ones)

What can happen if a cat picks up fleas while outdoors
------------correct----------------------
Fleas are a serious and potentially dangerous outdoor pest. These parasites bite and drink blood from both human and animal hosts, sometimes transmitting deadly bacteria that can lead to devastating illnesses.
While there are several flea-repellent methods and remedies you can use to help control fleas and protect your family and pets, it can be tricky to get rid of fleas entirely from around your property.
Because fleas are so common, and because they may be more common in some regions than others, it’s important to have a good game plan for flea protection and control. This is especially true when it comes to protecting your pets.
Both dogs and cats can be victims of flea bites, especially if they are unprotected with flea medications or flea collars. However, cats tend to be most at risk for flea infestations and flea bites, especially outdoor cats who spend the majority of their time in areas where wild animals may roam and transmit fleas.
In today’s article, we are going to talk about the best cat flea shampoo to help protect your cat. But before we begin, let’s first take a moment to talk about fleas.
Let’s get started!
But First, Let’s Talk About Fleas
Unprotected cats are commonly prone to suffering from fleas and flea bites.
Fleas are small, parasitic insects that live in grassy areas like woodlands, fields, and backyards. They have no wings and thus they cannot fly, but these pests can jump. In fact, fleas can jump up to 200 times their body size, which is about 13 inches.
Fleas also contain small barbs on their legs that help them cling to hosts, and they survive on blood hosts that include mammals like humans, wild animals, and pets like cats and dogs.
There are over 2,000 different species of fleas across the world, and they are problematic in nearly every continent except for Antarctica.
Though not all fleas are deadly, some can be. In the United States, fleas are known to carry some serious diseases that they can spread to both people and pets.
The most common flea in the United States is known as the “cat flea”, or the Ctenocephalides felis. The cat flea, in spite of its name, can be problematic for a variety of animals and sometimes even people.
But where do fleas come from?
Most cats will pick up fleas while outdoors, but outdoor cats are not the only cats at risk for fleas and fleabites. Even indoor cats can be at risk for fleas, especially if other pets bring fleas indoors, or if you bring our cat outdoors to play in the yard or go on a walk. It takes only a moment to pick up a flea, and a single pregnant flea can lead to an entire infestation on your cat or inside your home.
Fleas often find their way into your yard or property after being brought there by wild animals. Wild animal hosts for fleas include a number of animals like raccoons, deer, rabbits, mice, squirrels, rats, and more.
This means that even if you are vigilant and take care to keep your yard flea-free, you can never be certain that fleas are not on your property from one moment to the next.
If a cat picks up fleas, they could potentially bring them into your home and transmit them to other pets in the house and even to you or your loved ones.
Though fleas are incredibly small, they can have a big impact on the health of our furry family members and even on us.
Keep reading more to learn about the dangers of fleas to people and pets.
The Dangers Of Fleas For Cats, Dogs, And Even People
Unprotected cats can transmit fleas to people and other pets in the home.
As we just mentioned, fleas are a serious problem in not only the United States but also the world. Not only are fleas serious pests, but they are also quite dangerous. Fleas can carry and transmit a number of deadly diseases to both people and pets, including diseases like Murine Typhus, Tularemia, Bubonic Plague, and Tungiasis.
Of these diseases, the most common disease transmitted by fleas to cats in the United States is Murine Typhus.
Murine Typhus is caused due to Rickettsia typhi, a bacteria that is carried by infected wild animals, and even feral cats. Wild animals that can carry Rickettsia typhi tend to include animals like rats, opossums, raccoons, and other common wild animals that live in both suburban and urban areas.
Cat typhus, also known as feline panleukopenia, has a wide variety of symptoms that can range from mild to severe. Symptoms can take up to seven days to present themselves in your cat, and they include nausea, diarrhea, shivering, fever, vomiting, lethargy, and loss of appetite.
Typhus can be deadly in cats, but it is also treatable if you recognize the symptoms quickly. Most importantly, typhus is preventable when you utilize the tools and medications provided by your veterinarian, as well as other forms of pest control to repel and manage fleas in the area.
With that in mind, it’s time to talk about cat flea shampoo.
What Is Cat Flea Shampoo And Does It Really Work?
Cat shampoos can work to prevent and protect your cat from fleas when used properly.
Cat flea shampoo can be somewhat controversial, depending on who you speak with. While many people rave about cat flea shampoo products, not everyone agrees that cat flea shampoos are the best forms of flea prevention or protection for cats.
With that being said, there are some cat flea shampoo products that have proven effective against fleas and ticks, and some shampoos can even provide a longer-lasting solution to flea prevention than typical pet shampoos.
Cat flea shampoo products work most often by utilizing chemical ingredients designed to kill fleas and ticks on contact. Many of these types of cat flea shampoo products can take up to 48 hours to work, but they are often made to kill fleas, eggs, and nymphs, as well as other pests like lice.
Some cat flea shampoo products work only to kill fleas on contact once your cat has already contracted fleas. Other cat flea shampoo products can help to protect your cat from fleas for up to 28 days after application.
We should note here that most cat flea shampoo products contain chemical ingredients like insecticides, which can have adverse side effects on your cat. If you’re concerned about using a cat flea shampoo that contains insecticide chemicals, you can try using natural cat flea shampoo products that work using special oils and other natural, plant-based ingredients.
However, some natural cat flea shampoo products may not be as effective as chemical cat flea shampoo products, and it’s important to do your research before deciding which option is best for you and your cat.
Furthermore, sensitive cats can still have an adverse reaction to natural products as well. If you’re not sure about the best type of flea prevention and protection for your cat, it’s best to speak with a trusted veterinarian.
However, if you have decided that cat flea shampoo is the best option for you and your furry friend, we have listed several of our top-rated products below.
Take a look.
The Best Cat Flea Shampoo, According To Experts
It should be noted that not all cat shampoos for fleas are safe for kittens under the age of 12 weeks.
Remember, not all cat flea shampoo products are designed to work equally. Furthermore, many cat flea shampoo products work using chemical ingredients.
When you are looking for a cat flea shampoo for your unique pet, be sure to read the ingredients and consider the unique sensitivities of your cat.
Also, be aware that not all cat flea shampoo products work to provide long-term protection from fleas and ticks. When deciding which product you want to use to protect your pet, it’s important to consider your cat’s lifestyle, how often your cat is outside, and whether or not your cat is sensitive to certain ingredients.
Last, be sure to speak with your veterinarian about other forms of flea and tick protection and control, especially if you live in a region that is known for its prevalence of fleas and ticks.

What can guests expect in terms of managing reservations and seating at Graydon Carter’s Waverly Inn compared to The Lion
------------correct----------------------
Still can’t make it past the host stand at Graydon Carter’s Waverly Inn? No luck scoring a decent table at Minetta Tavern between 5:30 and 11pm? Take heart, scenester. The Lion is much less likely to turn you away. The latest addition to the new power pantheon may be Gotham’s most democratic high-profile restaurant. While the Waverly features just a tiny lounge to accommodate gawkers and won’t take reservations by phone, the bar at the Lion is surrounded by tables for walk-ins, and the phone lines are wide open.
Though you may still have a tough time landing a prime table for dinner—we managed to snag seats pretty easily on a Sunday evening—the reception is uncharacteristically warm for a place seeking Page Six immortality. Our waiter was so genial, he could have been stolen from a Danny Meyer establishment. A bartender on another evening was just as fraternal, pouring a generous drink while gushing over the burger I’d ordered. This despite a crush of publishing minions fighting their way to the bar—necks craning to catch a glimpse of every arrival—while co-owner and Men’s Health editor Dave Zinczenko held court among them.
While the magazine honcho is a partner in the Lion with NBC’s Dan Abrams, this is first and foremost a John DeLucie establishment. The chef—still the co-owner of the Waverly—is an imposing presence, greeting friends in the dining room one minute, expediting dishes the next.
His new restaurant, inspired by the West Village landmark that thrived at this brownstone locale in the ’60s (also the gay joint where Barbra Streisand made her singing debut), offers a reimagining of that bohemian haunt. The dining room is decked out in an eclectic montage of modern masterworks, Daily News crime snaps, and portraits of bearded men.
Like the city’s other clubby spots, the food takes a backseat to the scene. Which isn’t to say that it’s not often delicious. Like the Minetta Tavern’s straightforward menu, the selections are all fairly classic, and for the most part, exceptionally well done.
DeLucie’s continental cuisine—old-fashioned with modern finesse—looks to Spain, France, Italy and the U.S. Artichoke fritters are actually crispy tapas-style croquettes oozing lemony bchamel. Green and white matchstick asparagus with optimal snap are paired, in another straight-up starter, with velvety hollandaise sauce and an egg so delicately poached, the yolk practically breaks itself.

Action star Jackie Chan’s high-speed activity doesn’t stop when the cameras do. An enthusiastic supporter of hundreds of charities including UNICEF, Operation Smile and his own Jackie Chan Charitable Foundation, Chan offers the Look To The Stars writers an incredible challenge just trying to keep on top of his good works!
Chan spends countless hours helping others, and has been known to drop everything to find out how he can be of service after disasters strike. He raises millions of dollars to help those in need. In the first 8 months of 2010, he raised $36 million to help people across the globe, from Haiti to Singapore:
- Donated 5 million RMB (US $732,000) to help Haiti earthquake victims.
- Worked with WildAid to support preservation of endangered tigers.
- Donation of school supplies to “Charming Schools” in China
- Raised US $5.2 million in donations for the Singapore Thong Chai Medical Institution
- Helped raise US 29 million for drought relief in China.
- Visited Qinghai, China to bring food, water, and supplies to victims of the April 14, 6.9 magnitude earthquake
- Participated in the “Artistes 414 Fundraising Campaign” concert to raise money for victims of the April 14th earthquake in China
- Charity mission to Tongren in the Guizhou province of China to bring much-needed water and supplies to the drought stricken area.
2009 saw Chan using much of his spare time to visit the remotest parts of China on his Dragon’s Heart Charity Missions.
The Dragon's Heart Foundation strives to meet the needs of poverty-stricken children and the elderly in the hardest-to-reach areas of the immense country. Chan has made several trips to villages in these remote locations, bringing warm clothing, wheelchairs and school supplies, and helping to build schools.
In February of 2008, the Rush Hour star was on hand to donate 450 down coats to The Salvation Army for victims of the China snowstorms, and since 2004, Jackie’s charity has built 20 Dragon’s Heart Schools, providing education to some of China’s poorest citizens.
“Before, I didn’t like charity. I just wanted to be famous and to earn more money,” says Chan. “My friends taught me and now I like to do charity. Even when I am sleeping, I think how I can help other people. Every human being has to learn how to do charity.”
Jackie founded the Jackie Chan Charitable Foundation in 1988 to help young people in a variety of worthy causes, including medical services, aid to victims of natural disaster or illness, scholarships and youth activities.
Upon hearing about the 2007 Yunnan earthquake, Jackie immediately began making phone calls to find out what supplies were needed and how he could help.
In 2006, Chan:
- Made a considerable donation to the Civil Aviation Institute in Guanghan, China to fund programs for student pilots and airline staff
- Filmed a Public Service Announcement to warn children about the dangers of Avian Flu
- Visited the Yunan Province of China for the opening cerem

Consumers Union statement on new long term study of feeding GE grains to pigs
June 11, 2013
Statement of Michael Hansen, PhD, Senior Scientist, Consumers Union on New Long Term Study of Feeding GE Grains to Pigs
The new peer-reviewed long-term pig feeding study just published raises important concerns about possible health impacts of consuming genetically engineered (GE) corn and soy. There have been very few animal feeding studies of GE food to date, and extremely few that lasted longer than 90 days. This new study looked at pigs fed GE corn and soy under commercial production conditions over a 22.7 week period. Compared to a control group that was fed conventional corn and soy, the GE-fed pigs showed significant increases in severe stomach inflammation and thickening of the uterus. The study in online here: http://www.organic-
Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports, has long been concerned about the impact of GE crops and thinks these effects are a red flag and deserve further study. We also believe this study underlines the need for labeling of GE food, since there still much to learn about their health effects. Consumers Union urges state legislatures, as well as Congress, and the U.S. Food & Drug Administration to require labeling of GE foods.
This new long term study, which looked at pigs over their normal commercial lifetime of five months, reinforces concerns prompted by the

Presently thereupon Hugh Claxton grew verie cholerick, hott and angrie, and in his choler and anger called William King base drunken rogue, and withall struck him two or three blowes as hard as he could in his face; and thereupon King standing up, and forbearing Mr Claxton, Claxton clenching his hand held up his fist unto him and said, Sirra I will order you, and quoth Thomas Price there present, Aye master, I know you can do itt; whereupon William King without giving of any distaste at all *to Mr Claxton* either in word or deed that [Priddie] perceived or heard (being present all the time they were there together), departed, and went his waie.' Priddie and John Dando went homewards with [King] towards King's house, but then Priddie returned to the alehouse where he found Mr Claxton and the rest of the company. On his return, Claxton asked [him] if he heard King call him base rogue. Priddie replied, No, whereupon Claxton said, 'he would call [him] upon his oath, and throw him in jaile and keepe him there as long as he lived if [he] would not swear it'. Soon afterwards they all went homewards.
3. He well knew Thomas Price, who for about a year was well known 'to be a mortal enemie of William King'. Last Christmas, Price told him that Mr Claxton 'had the king's broad seale to serve [Priddie] up to London, and [Priddie] asked him, For what, and he replyed, For to be a witness, and [Priddie] asked him, For what business, he said, For to testifie that King did call Mr Claxton base rascall rogue; and then [he] told Price that he could testifie no such words, and that he believed there were no such words spoken. Whereupon Price told [him] that he had heard King speak it, and withal persuaded [him] to goe to London and sweare itt, and told [him] that [he] should have a horse and money to beare his charges, and ride to London fortnight before the terme and there lye gentleman like... that in hay harvest last it was commonlie *and crediblie* spoken in Compton Dando and the countrie thereabouts that Thomas Price did beate and wound King with a peeked staffe and indangered his life; and as the report went he did it when he arrested King at the suit of Mr Hugh Claxton.'
4. He well knew Thomas Price, Robert Poole and Thomas Monke, alias Mennck, who were 'people of noe credit or reputation where they live, and Thomas an ordinary common baylief, Robert Poole a young fellow of no abilitie or estate, and Thomas Monke... a man verie poore and of late had relief from the parish of Compton Dando where he liveth.' The witness thought 'they would be easily drawne to depose an untruth on their oathes'. Before going to London to testify, Poole voluntarily swore to [Priddie] that he could not testify that King called Claxton 'base rascal rogue or that he spake any other abusive terms unto him, onlie he said that all that he said at the alehouse was that Mr Claxton called King whoremaster.' The witness had also heard that Claxton gave Monke half a crown to buy him a pair of shoes to go to London to testify in this business'.

fos. 231r-232r (Witness 3), Robert Horsington of Compton Dando, co. Somerset, husbandman, lived there for about 40 years, born in Litton, co. Somerset, aged about 75
To King's defence:
3. Since last hay harvest, Price 'hath been and is a capital enimie of William King' because 'he swore a rescue against King when as to [Horsington's] knowledge, being present at the time when it was pretended the rescue was, there was no such rescue made. But to [his] knowledge in haie harvest last, in a cloase in the parish of Compton Dando, Thomas Price with a picked staffe fought with Kinge, and then at the tyme Kinge received a wound in his side; and [he] verily believeth Price gave him the wound'. On this occasion, Price had come to arrest King at Mr Claxton's suit.
4. Thomas Price and Thomas Monke, alias Mennck were well known as men 'of little or noe credit or reputation... of poore condicon'. Monke had recently taken parish relief.
Signed by Robert Horsington [his mark], and by the two commissioners.
fos. 232v-233v (Witness 4), John Browne of Compton Dando, co. Somerset, husbandman, lived there for about 40 years, born in Litton, co. Somerset, aged about 60
To King's defence:
3. He well knew Thomas Price, and since last hay harvest 'about midsummer', Price had been King's enemy, where he fought with King, in a meadow of King's mother's in Compton Dando, 'and there with a picked staffe did grievouslie beate and wound Kinge and indangered his life at the time, which [Browne] plainly saw, being near unto the ground when *he used him soe*.' On this occasion, Price had come to arrest King at Mr Claxton's suit. Since then it was well known that King and Price were enemies.
4. Thomas Price and Thomas Monke, alias Mennck were well known as poor men, 'of mean rank or condition'. Last year Monke had taken parish relief. Both were 'of no credit or reputacon amongst their honest neighbours but accompted and reputed for base people.'
Signed by John Browne [his mark], and by the two commissioners.

On 3 February Dr Duck produced Robert Poole as an additional witness for the prosecution. On 12 February the commissioners for taking the defence witnesses' depositions were nominated as in the letters commissory for that date. Order was given that sentence was to be heard on 6 and 20 November 1638.

highly controversial Seralini study, which looked at rats fed GE food over a two year period, compared to rats fed a non-GE diet. That study also found differences in health outcomes, including higher rates of certain tumors, and liver and kidney problems, among rats fed a GE diet.
This new study of pigs, published in the Journal of Organic Systems is valuable because it used a relatively large study sample size (168 pigs including controls), and was conducted at a U.S. pig production facility in Iowa. The research was led by an Australian scientist.
The study found that the uteri of GE-fed pigs was significantly larger (weighed 25 percent more) than those of non-GE-fed pigs. In addition, the rate of severe stomach inflammation was more than 2.5-fold higher, on average, for GE-fed pigs compared to non-GE-fed pigs (32 percent vs. 12 percent, respectively). Indeed, for male pigs, the rate of severe stomach inflammation was four times higher for GE-fed males to non-GE fed males, and for females, the rate was more than 2-fold higher.
As the authors conclude: “The results indicate that it would be prudent for GM crops that are destined for human food and animal feed, including stacked GM crops, to undergo long-term animal feeding studies preferably before commercial planting, particularly for toxicological and reproductive effects.”

What will be included in the author's potato croquettes recipe
------------correct----------------------
Hi and welcome to my cooking portion! I am so happy some of you are interested with my simple home-cooked meals! They are boring, I may have to tell you in advance as I don't include much seafood in any of my recipe because...I am allergic to it!
So recently, I am really into potatoes and corn combo! Thankfully, the household love this combination as well so I've decided to create my own "Potato Croquettes" as side dish, since I got leftover corn kernels from recent cooking, I've decided to add in for some extra crunch and sweetness. Feel free to change the ingredients to ham, bacon or just leave it to plain potato croquettes!
- Corn kernels (optional)
- Corn starch
- Al

------------question-----------------------
What should you do after running scans with Malware Bytes and CCleaner to change how you use the computer
------------correct----------------------
ogram such as Malware Bytes, and also a registry cleaner for when its done, CCLeaner will do this nicely, and its also free.
1. download Malware Bytes (Free). www.malwarebytes.org
2. download and install CCleaner www.piriform.com/ccleaner
2. Install and update definitions for both as needed, but close apps after updates.
3. Shut down and reboot into safe mode
4. Launch Malware Bytes and run a full scan, have it remove anything it finds
5. Run CCleaner and choose registry scan, have it remove/fix anything it finds, run it a few times.
6. If you have updated Anti Virus definitions, you should run a full scan of that also.
All this should be done in Safe Mode, as Malware/Virus/Spyware typically will not run in safe mode, making it possible to detect and clean them.
Now the hard part, you need to change how you use the computer, you will have cleaned/cured the symptoms, but not the root cause. The root cause is that you have Administrative rights to your user account, why? Make sure you know the local admin account password, or create another account with admin rights. Once that is done, change your account to limited user rights, this will limit yours and any virus/malware access to key pieces of your system. When you want to install new software/hardware, use the admin account.
One of the ways to protect your comp. is do not click to any link if you are not sure about it, and the same with accessing a new website, or running a software, etc.

r of various selections from Kelly Carpenter’s instrumental CD, “Draw Me Close”, originally released in 2001 and re-released in 2009. Kelly wrote the title song “Draw Me Close”, a contemporary worship song, in 1994 and it has since become a worship classic, sung in churches around the world. It is available for purchase in the Store.
Here is an alternate take of “Waiting” from my 2011 instrumental release “Passage”. For fun, I added some audio FX. So close your eyes and imagine yourself sitting by a stream in the sun, gentle breeze through the trees, birds singing. Enjoy!
Here is footage from the CD release concert on Nov 18, 2011 at Fremont Abbey in Seattle. Here they perform a cover of David Ruis’ “Whom Have I But You?” with a stunning intro by Bryn Cannon and a wonderful guitar outro by Scott A. Burnett.
“Recently, I wrote a song calling for peace, inspired by things that I have thinking and feeling lately that finally had to find expression. This song is more than just about ending war, it is also about ending injustice, and I felt compelled to include images of figures over the past century who took a nonviolent stand against injustice: Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi, and Nelson Mandela.”
Lately I have been into writing anthemic-sounding songs. Here’s the latest work in progress titled “The Games”. This is free to download, just keep in mind that it is still very rough.
Here is a video montage of several songs from Kelly’s 2011 watershed release “Passage”. Footage from the studio sessions in Vancouver, Canada is included.

Workday Rising Europe: Welcoming New Citizens to the Cloud
Today we are hosting the first Workday Rising Europe in London, designed specifically for our customers in Europe. This event will also benefit others wanting to learn more about Workday from our team members and customers.
It's also my first Workday Rising! Having heard about these legendary customer events in the U.S., I know our London gathering will be a great one. The interest in Workday Rising Europe among customers and prospective customers has exceeded our expectations, and all of us at Workday are incredibly honoured by such enthusiasm.
Yet I'm not surprised. I joined Workday earlier this year as president, EMEA, attracted by the company's culture, strategy, and market opportunity. Two months later, what I find most inspiring about Workday is our customers. I've met with many of them since January, and I'm amazed by their excitement and willingness to share how they're using and benefitting from Workday. It's clear that the Workday real cloud and our power of one play an important part in their desire to share experiences as citizens of the cloud. I have no doubt the customer panels at Workday Rising Europe will be the highlight of the event!
I also think our European customers realise they're helping drive significant change across their regions and industries. Companies throughout Europe are focused on business transformation, and know that's only possible with the right processes, systems, and people. Business transformation also requires becoming more efficient wh

What does Dr. Andy suggest is a better alternative to using the Export – MPEG-4 option in MPEG Stream Clip for saving files
------------correct----------------------
Some Video Tips from Dr Andy
Andy Rush, resident DTLT expert, creator of our video resource site just showed me a helpful tip for MPEG Stream Clip.
I’ve previously suggested using the Export – MPEG-4 option for saving your files, but he showed me that you will get a better quality video (and often a smaller file size) if you simply use the File -> Save As… option. This will keep the file in the same format it was, as it is not having to encode the video, it is also faster than converting.

Directors Desk provides multiple layers of security to protect our clients' most vital corporate records.
User authentication is tightly controlled through "strong passwords," fully encrypted transport, procedures surrounding account activation, and encryption of all service level passwords in the system.
Role-based security protocols control which content is available to each user upon logging in.
Network and host-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) protect all hardware and applications in the Directors Desk server farm
Complying with security standards, having good authentication and authorization systems in place is great. So are IDS systems. But no matter how many layers of security are in place, what matters is how well it's all orchestrated together. That's why lists of standards being adhered to, as well as security technologies in place don't really tell us much about how secure an organization is.
So far, not much information about this hack. Hopefully, Nasdaq is correct, and no customer information was stolen. But we still don't know who was behind the attack, and can only assume that it was board secrets that the attackers sought.

What significant health impacts were observed in pigs fed genetically engineered grains compared to those fed conventional grains in the recent long-term study
------------correct----------------------
Consumers Union statement on new long term study of feeding GE grains to pigs
June 11, 2013
Statement of Michael Hansen, PhD, Senior Scientist, Consumers Union on New Long Term Study of Feeding GE Grains to Pigs
The new peer-reviewed long-term pig feeding study just published raises important concerns about possible health impacts of consuming genetically engineered (GE) corn and soy. There have been very few animal feeding studies of GE food to date, and extremely few that lasted longer than 90 days. This new study looked at pigs fed GE corn and soy under commercial production conditions over a 22.7 week period. Compared to a control group that was fed conventional corn and soy, the GE-fed pigs showed significant increases in severe stomach inflammation and thickening of the uterus. The study in online here: http://www.organic-
Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports, has long been concerned about the impact of GE crops and thinks these effects are a red flag and deserve further study. We also believe this study underlines the need for labeling of GE food, since there still much to learn about their health effects. Consumers Union urges state legislatures, as well as Congress, and the U.S. Food & Drug Administration to require labeling of GE foods.
This new long term study, which looked at pigs over their normal commercial lifetime of five months, reinforces concerns prompted by the

------------question-----------------------
What new feature is being introduced in the latest update of the Google Maps app related to transportation
------------correct----------------------
Google will make to request transportation via mobile devices much easier with the latest update of their Google Maps app, in which you’ll be able to order a cab without leaving the app.
Previously, the app could only give you an estimate of the fair price and help you through the first steps of the process, but with this update, now you will able to complete the full process.
This capability will be part of the redesign ride services area of the application, in which instead of a list of services, you will see an on-screen map with the nearby drivers. Also, there’s no word about when or if it ever will include other transportation alternatives like Lyft again as an option. Users will also get important functionalities like, for example, choosing the type of car that you need for the service (POOL, uberX, uberXL, SELECT, BLACK o LUX).
Using the new option is super simple. You just need to sign in with your Uber account, and that’s pretty much it, you’ll be ready to request your Uber.
While this can translate into a boost for the application’s traffic, usage, and presence, the people from Uber will

What were the major health outcomes observed in pigs fed a genetically engineered (GE) diet compared to those fed a non-GE diet in the study published in the Journal of Organic Systems
------------correct----------------------
highly controversial Seralini study, which looked at rats fed GE food over a two year period, compared to rats fed a non-GE diet. That study also found differences in health outcomes, including higher rates of certain tumors, and liver and kidney problems, among rats fed a GE diet.
This new study of pigs, published in the Journal of Organic Systems is valuable because it used a relatively large study sample size (168 pigs including controls), and was conducted at a U.S. pig production facility in Iowa. The research was led by an Australian scientist.
The study found that the uteri of GE-fed pigs was significantly larger (weighed 25 percent more) than those of non-GE-fed pigs. In addition, the rate of severe stomach inflammation was more than 2.5-fold higher, on average, for GE-fed pigs compared to non-GE-fed pigs (32 percent vs. 12 percent, respectively). Indeed, for male pigs, the rate of severe stomach inflammation was four times higher for GE-fed males to non-GE fed males, and for females, the rate was more than 2-fold higher.
As the authors conclude: “The results indicate that it would be prudent for GM crops that are destined for human food and animal feed, including stacked GM crops, to undergo long-term animal feeding studies preferably before commercial planting, particularly for toxicological and reproductive effects.”

What kind of malware did the user encounter on their laptop
------------correct----------------------
Trojan DNS Changer
Or something like that. Has anyone else gotten this nasty little bug yet? I took my laptop to the PC shop where they completely debugged it. It also had some sort of phony antivirus popup Not Desktop 2010 malware. It turns out it was in my Lynksis wireless router so I now have to password protect that. Thay are still working on it remotely as I speak. Don't know how much it will cost yet.
I have also come to the conclusion that Norton 360 is totally worthless. They're tech support is abysmal and they wanted $136 to help me debug my PC. The store guys recommended Trend which is a lot cheaper. Maybe half the price of Norton.
You don't need a pay for AV on a home computer. Put Avast Free on it. None of the AV programs are catching this nasty piece of work. Even the dedicated Malware scanners are having trouble with it. If it's the one I'm seeing a lot of lately then it's part of a rootkit, which hides itself extremely well and loads up before Windows does, and before any of your security software. Norton is still junk, but the others aren't any better in this case.
use Firefox with AdBlock and NoScript addons, will prevent most malware from having a chance to get on your pc.
There are several free AV apps that are just as good as the paid ones.
AVG and Avira are two of the more better known ones.
Either way, they will not detect what you have wrong with your PC. You have "Malware", not a "Virus". Malware is software designed to do harm. What you need is an Anti-Malware pr

Directors Desk provides multiple layers of security to protect our clients' most vital corporate records.
User authentication is tightly controlled through "strong passwords," fully encrypted transport, procedures surrounding account activation, and encryption of all service level passwords in the system.
Role-based security protocols control which content is available to each user upon logging in.
Network and host-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) protect all hardware and applications in the Directors Desk server farm
Complying with security standards, having good authentication and authorization systems in place is great. So are IDS systems. But no matter how many layers of security are in place, what matters is how well it's all orchestrated together. That's why lists of standards being adhered to, as well as security technologies in place don't really tell us much about how secure an organization is.
So far, not much information about this hack. Hopefully, Nasdaq is correct, and no customer information was stolen. But we still don't know who was behind the attack, and can only assume that it was board secrets that the attackers sought.

What are the common causes of teeth discoloration mentioned in the text
------------correct----------------------
Good oral hygiene helps. But when you’re looking to make your smile shine, there’s tooth whitening—available at Battersea Smiles!
If you’re looking to make your teeth shine again, there are a few treatment options available. Whitening toothpaste and the like can be good for treating extrinsic surface stains. But for more stubborn intrinsic deeper stains, a whitening agent needs to be administered and prescribed by a professional.
Whitening agents—such as hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide—work by penetrating through the enamel to get to the discoloured molecules. The oxygen from the agent reacts with the discoloured molecules, breaking them down.
The darkening of your teeth is a natural process that occurs as you age. Good oral hygiene will help slow the effects, but it can’t be totally avoided. Food and drink with strong colourings—red wine, coffee, tea—speed up the staining process. Smoking is also a major cause.
Teeth whitening is a common procedure here at Battersea Smiles. Whether you’re off to a special occasion, or jus

What is the main issue at stake in City Hall's lawsuit against the Federal Aviation Administration regarding Santa Monica Airport
------------correct----------------------
SMO ‚Äî The papers are in and now we wait.
A motion to dismiss City Hall‚Äôs lawsuit against the Federal Aviation Administration over the future of Santa Monica Airport will not require a hearing.
Judge John F. Walter is opting to make a decision based on the written arguments filed by City Hall‚Äôs attorneys and the FAA, City Attorney Marsha Moutrie told the Daily Press.
In October, City Hall announced it would sue the federal government to retain full control of the airport‚Äôs future.
Neighboring residents have long complained about the noise and pollution created by the propellor planes and jets. Others fear for their safety, pointing out that the runway is only a few hundred feet from homes. In September, a jet veered off the runway into a hangar. The hangar caught fire causing the roof to collapse and all four aboard were killed.
City Hall owns the land but the FAA says that various agreements obligate the space to continue to operate as an airport.
Last month, the FAA asked the judge to toss the lawsuit, claiming that City Hall knew of the federal government‚Äôs intentions for the airport half a century ago. If City Hall wanted to sue, the FAA said, it should have been within 12 years of when they realized those intentions.
City Hall responded to the motion, pointing out that while they knew the federal government intended to operate SMO as an airport for decades, it was only a few years ago, in 2008, that they learned its intentions

Advantage Flea and Tick Treatment
Advantage Flea and Tick Treatment is a popular cat flea shampoo for cats and kittens over the age of 12 weeks. Again, this cat flea shampoo works using a small dose of insecticide pyrethrins to kill fleas and ticks in their different life stages.
The product is not specified as use-alone flea protection for cats. Instead, it should be used as part of a complete regimen for flea and tick protection for your pet.
Along with using a quality cat flea shampoo, experts recommend using other flea repellents to protect your cat or kittens including flea collars, flea ointments, chews, or prescription flea and tick control provided by your veterinarian.
Zodiac Flea and Tick Shampoo
Zodiac Flea and Tick Shampoo is a cat flea shampoo that works for both cats and dogs. It works against fleas and ticks, killing them on contact. The active ingredients include pyrethrins and other ingredients that help protect your pets from these parasitic pests.

This shampoo has a pleasant scent and is made to be used on pets 12 weeks and older.
Sentry PurrScriptions Flea and Tick Shampoo For Cats

This cat flea shampoo product works on fleas, ticks, and lice in different life stages. It comes in a coconut berry scent and not only helps protect your cat by killing fleas and ticks during the shampoo rinse but also helps ensure your cat’s coat is healthy and soft.
Like most of the cat flea shampoo products on our list above, do not use this flea and tick shampoo on kittens under the age of 12 weeks old.
Other Products That Can Help Protect Your Cat From Fleas
Cat flea shampoos are not the only products you can use to protect your cat from fleas.
While a cat flea shampoo can work effectivley to help get rid of fleas and protect your cat from future fleas and flea bites, it is not always the best flea-protection option for every cat.
Luckily, there are a wide variety of flea repellent products you can choose from when it comes to protecting your cat from these pesky parasites.
Take a look.
Advantage ll Flea Prevention And Treatment
Advantage ll Flea Prevention and Treatment is one of the most common forms of flea prevention and protection for cats and dogs. This product specifically is for larger cats over 9 pounds, but you can order it in doses that are suitable for any size cat.
Not only will this product kill fleas on contact, but it can also protect your cat from contracting future fleas.
The product comes in a pack of one, two, four, or six, and works using a topical ointment that protects cats from fleas, flea eggs, and flea larvae. It provides up to two months of protection against these pests and it is safe for cats in all their life stages.
Cheristin For Cats Topical Flea Prevention
Another product that is designed to protect cats from fleas along with cat flea shampoo is Cheristin for Cats. This product can start killing fleas in as little as 30 minutes after application and is designed for cats over the weight of 1.8 pounds.
It also provides up to six weeks of protection against fleas when used properly and can be safely administered on kittens as young as eight weeks old. It includes a rounded tip applicator for easy and comfortable application and is effective against 98% of fleas within 12 hours.
Seresto Flea Collar For Cats
If you have an outdoor cat, many experts recommend using a flea collar. Flea collars like the flea collar listed above by Seresto can help to protect your cat from pests like fleas and ticks for up to eight months.
Flea collars work by continuously releasing a low concentration of medicated ointment over your cat’s skin and coat.
The product works within 24 hours of being applied and works to repel and kill fleas on contact. This means that fleas do not need to bite your cat in order to be killed, which is important when it comes to protecting your cat from certain diseases these parasites can carry and transmit. We also like that this flea collar is odorless, non-greasy, and effective.
CapAction Fast-Acting Oral Flea Treatment For Cats
Last, we have a tablet you can provide for your cat and kitten to help repel and kill fleas on contact. These tables come in an order of six and are for cats between two and 25 pounds. They are also safe to give to cats four weeks and older.
The tablets are made to kill adult fleas and can help to stop reinfestations in the future. When used alongside a quality cat flea shampoo, you can help protect both indoor and outdoor cats from fleas and their bites.
This product may also help reduce the chances of not only flea-borne illnesses but also allergy dermatitis caused by flea and tick bites.
With all that being said, this product is designed to kill fleas on contact and is not necessarily designed to be used as a flea prevention product.
DIY Remedies You Can Use To Make Your Own Cat Flea Shampoo At Home
There are ways you can make your own cat shampoo at home.
It is possible to make your own cat flea shampoo at home, which is great news for anyone passionate about do it yourself pest control remedies.
To make your own cat flea shampoo, you will need the following ingredients and to follow the below instructions.

- 1 Cup Of Distilled Water
- 1 Clean, Empty Bottle

Other Expert Tips On Flea Prevention For Cats
Protecting your cat from fleas goes beyond using a cat shampoo.
As we discussed earlier, cats are some of the most common victims of fleas. If cats contract fleas, they could be at risk of serious disease. Furthermore, they can spread fleas to people and pets, and even bring flea infestations to the home.
If you’re concerned about your cat and potential fleas, here are some other methods you can use to keep fleas at bay and protect your cat.
First, Protect Your Pets Accordingly
Just because cats may have a higher risk of suffering from flea infestations doesn’t mean they are the only pet at risk. All pets from dogs, rabbits, and ferrets can potentially contract fleas.
Protect your home and your pets from fleas by ensuring your pets are all protected with flea repellents and remedies.
Many veterinarians recommend flea collars for pets, but you also have the option of using topical ointments, tablets, and of course flea prevention shampoos.

108 CLAXTON V KING
Hugh Claxton of Bedminster, co. Somerset v William King of Compton Dando, co. Somerset
November 1637 - November 1638
Claxton prosecuted King for abusive words in Thomas Taylor's alehouse in Compton Dando, Somerset, at Whitsun in 1637. King admitted to the words in the libel, but claimed that he had spoken them after asking Claxton for security for a loan he was arranging for him and that he was provoked by Claxton calling him 'base drunken rogue' and striking him in the face. He also claimed Claxton's three main witnesses were 'base idle fellows', one of whom, his servant, Thomas Price, had wounded him with a pikestaff the previous summer when trying to arrest him at Claxton's suit and sworn against him in the Court of Common Pleas. Proceedings were under way by November 1637 and the defendant's witnesses were examined by a commission led by John Burges and Barnard Atkins, gents, at the Three Tuns Inn in Bath, Somerset, on 27 March 1638. It was ordered that sentence be heard on 6 November 1638, but no further proceedings survive.
14/1cc, Defence interrogatories
1. The witnesses were warned of the penalty for perjury and bearing false witness. What was the age, occupation and condition of the witness? Where had they lived for the last ten years? How long had they known the parties?
2. Were they a relative, household servant or retainer of Claxton or King? Were they indebted to Claxton or King?

Cur Mil II, fo. 250, Defence
1. William King spoke the words in the libel at the time and place in the libel to Hugh Claxton, 'yet the words were spoken in an alehouse while William and Hugh were drinking and tipling together with other company in the alehouse'?
2. 'That before such time as the words are pretended to be spoken by William to Hugh, Hugh would have borrowed some money of William, which William offered to lend Hugh, for as Hugh would give William security for the same. Whereupon, and because William demanded security of Hugh, Hugh grew into a choler, and immediately called William base drunken rogue, and gave William a blow on the face; and the premises were so done before William spoke any of the pretended words against Hugh.'
3. 'That Thomas Price, witness, produced, sworn and examined on Claxton's behalf hath been and is for divers years last past a capitall and deadly enemy of William Kinge, and hath within the monthes of May, June, July, August or September last past, within the parish of Compton Dando beaten and wounded William Kinge with a picked staffe, and also came to arrest him at Claxton's suite and swore a recasse [sic] against him in the Court of Common Pleas at Westminster.'
4. 'That Thomas Price, Robert Poole and Thomas Monke have been and are base idle fellows, of noe credit or reputacon, and such as wilbe readily drawne either for favour or reward to depose an untruth upon theire oaths. And for such Price, Poole and Monke have been for diverse years commonly accompted, reputed and taken soe to be.'

Cur Mil II, fos. 222-39, Defence depositions
Taken before commissioners John Burges and Barnard Atkins, gents, on 27 March 1638 at the Three Tuns Inn, in the city of Bath, co. Somerset, with Alexander Jett, notary public.
fos. 224r-227r (Witness 1), John Dando of High Littleton parish, co. Somerset, yeoman, lived there for over 20 years, born in Hinton Blewett parish, co. Somerset, aged about 71
To King's defence:
1, 2. At 3pm on last Whitsun Wednesday, before his examination, he went with the defendant to Thomas Taylor's alehouse in Compton Dando. In the hall there they found Hugh Claxton, Mr Vaughan, Thomas Price, Nicholas Priddie, John Browne and others, drinking beer and taking tobacco together. These men 'badd them friendlie welcome, and desired them to sit down and drink with them', which they did. They talked 'in a faire and friendlie waie for neere an howre's space, and then Hugh Claxton and William King arose from the table, and both of them went out into the backside together, where they had not long stayed before they came into the hall againe and weare and continued friends together for ought [Dando] perceived to the contrarie; and he verily believeth they were so, for they talked fairlie and friendlie each to the other, and drank each to the other in a loving and friendlie manner *after their coming in againe*'. Some time after their return Claxton said to King, Shall I have it?, Yes, quoth King (in a modest and civill waie), you shall have fortie shillings if you will give me security for the same, whereupon Hugh Claxton forthwith grew verie cholerick and angrie and called William King base drunken rascall, rogue, and with his fist struck the said King on the face; and shortlie thereupon William King and [he] *with Nicholas Priddie* departed away out of the alehouse and King went homewards'. The witness was with King for all the time he was in the alehouse, and King in 'no manner of waie provoked Mr Claxton to use those termes... or to strike him'. He did not hear King at any time call Claxton 'base, rascall rogue'.
3. He had known Thomas Price for about 1 or 2 years, who was well known 'to be a capital and deadlie enemie of William King'. Last summer 'by common and credible report', Price came to arrest King on Hugh Claxton's suit, and 'beate and wounded Kinge', which wound in King's side, [he] saw.
4. He had known Price and Thomas Monke, alias Menack, 'for some years past', and both were 'comonlie accompted, reputed and taken to be base and idle conditioned fellows and of no credit or reputacon amongst *their* honest neighbours, and such as *are* given *ordinarily* to swearing in common discourse, and therefore, he verily believeth, wilbe easily drawne for a reward to depose an untruth on their oathes.'
Signed by John Dando [his mark] and by commissioners John Burges and Barnard Atkins.
fos. 227r-231r (Witness 2), Nicholas Priddie of Publow, co. Somerset, tailor, lived there for about 6 years, before that in Marksbury parish, co. Somerset for about 4 years, and St Cuthbert's, Wells, co. Somerset, aged about 21
To King's defence:
1, 2. At about 3pm on last Whitsun Wednesday, before his examination, he went with 'Mr Thomas Vaughan, and one Robert Poole, a poore young fellow', to Thomas Taylor's alehouse in Compton Dando.

It wasn't the Nasdaq stock market that the attackers were after it turns out, but information from the boards of directors of publicly traded companies. To get that, it was their Web-based collaboration platform – Directors Desk – that was the target.
This statement from Nasdaq says that the company detected suspicious files on U.S. servers and determined: that our web facing application Directors Desk was potentially affected. We immediately conducted an investigation, which included outside forensic firms and U.S. federal law enforcement. The files were immediately removed and at this point there is no evidence that any Directors Desk customer information was accessed or acquired by hackers.
The The Wall Street Journal, in a follow-up story, reported that the exchange will be run as usual for trading on Monday.
According its own Web site, Directors Desk is used by 10,000 directors at Fortune 500 sized companies. That's a trove of information, so no shocker the system was targeted.
The Nasdaq OMX was no slouch when it comes to security, either:

you just know he has the title of ‘Emperor’ in his sights.
It has become his theme song in my head, so imagine how I felt when I discovered this on Youtube!!!
Thank you ‘All-Things-Geeky‘ on Youtube.
I also book marked this a while back which just sums up Domhnall Gleeson.
That scowel, knee high boots and leather gloves will never be boring. Unfortunately I think that the good General will be going down with his ship in the next movie. If he survives VIII he certainly won’t make it to the end of Episode IX.
Right, time for a long walk to make up for that glass of wine.
I’ve just realised I’ve done it again…. Panic at the Disco in the same post as One Direction!!! My daughter’s are going to kill me!!

------------answer-----------------------
Multiple sclerosis, or MS, is a disease of the central nervous system that can cause symptoms throughout the body. Most experts believe it is an autoimmune condition, in which the immune system mistakenly attacks normal tissues in the body.
In the case of MS, the immune system attacks the myelin sheath that normally protects nerve fibers in the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve. The underlying nerve fibers can also be damaged or destroyed in this attack.
As the attack progresses, the myelin sheath becomes inflamed and gradually is destroyed, leaving areas of patchy scar tissue (sclerosis) that disrupt the electrical impulses between the brain and other parts of the body.
The term “multiple sclerosis” refers to the multiple areas of scar tissue — often called “lesions” — that develop along affected nerve fibers and that are visible in MRI scans. The literal meaning of “sclerosis” is “pathological hardening of tissue.”
The lesions caused by MS, and the resulting disruption of nerve impulses throughout the body, are what cause most of the symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis.
The nerve damage that occurs in MS can lead to a broad variety of symptoms. Some common early symptoms include visual problems, difficulties with balance and walking, numbness and tingling, and heat intolerance.
Less common symptoms include problems speaking or swallowing, itchy skin or altered sensations, and tremor.
In making an MS diagnosis, a doctor considers a person’s history of symptoms, along with the results of MRI scans and other medical tests.
The cause of MS is unknown — no one knows what sets off the immune reaction that leads to MS lesions in the first place. But it is thought that some combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental causes is necessary to trigger the disease.
Some researchers suspect the immune attack is triggered by certain kinds of viral infections. Others point to low vitamin D levels as a contributing cause. Cigarette smoking is also known to raise the risk of developing MS. (1)
Because there’s no national registry for multiple sclerosis, the true prevalence of MS in the United States is unknown. Most organizations estimate it at 400,000, but new research suggests the number of Americans with MS may be closer to 1 million.
Most people who are diagnosed with MS have no known risk factors. Approximately 20 percent of people with MS have a family member who has it, but even having an identical twin with MS increases the risk by only 20 to 40 percent. So even though having a family history of MS raises the risk somewhat, MS is not considered a genetic or hereditary disease.
Some other risk factors for MS include being a woman, vitamin D deficiency, obesity, having an autoimmune condition, smoking, exposure to the Epstein-Barr virus, having multiple concussions during adolescence, and living further away from the equator.
While anyone can develop MS, many of those who have it share the following characteristics:
Age The majority experience their first symptoms between the ages of 20 and 40.
Race Caucasians have long been believed to be more than twice as likely as other races to develop MS. But the underrepresentation of racial and ethnic minorities in clinical trials calls this belief into question.
Gender MS is two to three times more common in women as in men. (2)
Climate MS is five times more common in temperate climates — like the northern United States, Canada, and Europe — than in tropical climates.
Genes People whose close relatives have MS are more susceptible to developing the disease, but there is no evidence the disease is directly inherited.
Scientists have long described different types of MS, the most common being relapsing-remitting MS, primary-progressive MS, and secondary-progressive MS. But in recent years there’s a growing consensus that these are not distinct types of MS, but rather points along a continuum. At some points, inflammation is the predominant characteristic of the disease, while at others, neurodegeneration — in which old injuries to the brain and spinal cord worsen — predominates.
Nonetheless, most people with MS are still diagnosed with a particular type of the disease.
This type of MS is characterized by periods of active inflammation in the central nervous system, during which symptoms worsen (and new symptoms may develop), alternating with periods when symptoms are less acute.
The times when symptoms worsen are known as relapses, flares, or exacerbations. As a relapse ends, the severity of symptoms diminishes, but a person can be left with new, permanent symptoms.
The quiet periods between relapses are called remissions. Remissions may last for months or years before a relapse occurs.
RRMS is the most common type of MS — estimates vary, but between 80 and 90 percent of people with MS are diagnosed with this relapsing-remitting course of the disease, and most people with RRMS eventually develop secondary-progressive MS.
This type of MS is generally considered a second phase of RRMS, in which there is symptom progression and increased disability. People with SPMS may continue to have relapses, although they may be less frequent than in RRMS.
Most people who are diagnosed with RRMS will eventually transition to SPMS, but each person’s experience with it — whether or not they have relapses and how much progression, or disease worsening, occurs — will be unique.
In PPMS there is no initial relapse that signals the beginning of the disease. Instead, MS symptoms gradually appear over time.
Those who have PPMS generally do not experience acute exacerbations or have distinct remissions, but they may have temporary plateaus during which symptoms lessen somewhat.
About 10 to 15 percent of people with MS are diagnosed with PPMS, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine.
A small percentage of people with MS have a benign form of the disease, in which symptoms progress very little over the course of a person's lifetime, after the initial attack.
There’s some controversy over how (or whether) to classify people with benign MS, since the progress of the disease can vary over a person’s lifetime, according to the National MS Society.
A small number of people with MS have malignant MS, which is marked by the rapid formation of lesions in the brain and spine, causing severe symptoms, disability, and possibly death.
Beyond the direct effects of MS symptoms — of which there are many and of varying severity — there can be additional consequences of some symptoms.
Bladder problems are very common in people with MS, affecting at least 8

ogram such as Malware Bytes, and also a registry cleaner for when its done, CCLeaner will do this nicely, and its also free.
1. download Malware Bytes (Free). www.malwarebytes.org
2. download and install CCleaner www.piriform.com/ccleaner
2. Install and update definitions for both as needed, but close apps after updates.
3. Shut down and reboot into safe mode
4. Launch Malware Bytes and run a full scan, have it remove anything it finds
5. Run CCleaner and choose registry scan, have it remove/fix anything it finds, run it a few times.
6. If you have updated Anti Virus definitions, you should run a full scan of that also.
All this should be done in Safe Mode, as Malware/Virus/Spyware typically will not run in safe mode, making it possible to detect and clean them.
Now the hard part, you need to change how you use the computer, you will have cleaned/cured the symptoms, but not the root cause. The root cause is that you have Administrative rights to your user account, why? Make sure you know the local admin account password, or create another account with admin rights. Once that is done, change your account to limited user rights, this will limit yours and any virus/malware access to key pieces of your system. When you want to install new software/hardware, use the admin account.
One of the ways to protect your comp. is do not click to any link if you are not sure about it, and the same with accessing a new website, or running a software, etc.

What major themes and inspirations are reflected in Kelly Carpenter's recent songwriting
------------correct----------------------
r of various selections from Kelly Carpenter’s instrumental CD, “Draw Me Close”, originally released in 2001 and re-released in 2009. Kelly wrote the title song “Draw Me Close”, a contemporary worship song, in 1994 and it has since become a worship classic, sung in churches around the world. It is available for purchase in the Store.
Here is an alternate take of “Waiting” from my 2011 instrumental release “Passage”. For fun, I added some audio FX. So close your eyes and imagine yourself sitting by a stream in the sun, gentle breeze through the trees, birds singing. Enjoy!
Here is footage from the CD release concert on Nov 18, 2011 at Fremont Abbey in Seattle. Here they perform a cover of David Ruis’ “Whom Have I But You?” with a stunning intro by Bryn Cannon and a wonderful guitar outro by Scott A. Burnett.
“Recently, I wrote a song calling for peace, inspired by things that I have thinking and feeling lately that finally had to find expression. This song is more than just about ending war, it is also about ending injustice, and I felt compelled to include images of figures over the past century who took a nonviolent stand against injustice: Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi, and Nelson Mandela.”
Lately I have been into writing anthemic-sounding songs. Here’s the latest work in progress titled “The Games”. This is free to download, just keep in mind that it is still very rough.
Here is a video montage of several songs from Kelly’s 2011 watershed release “Passage”. Footage from the studio sessions in Vancouver, Canada is included.
A downtempo piece with a haunting Celtic-style melody.

0 percent of them, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.
Some people have trouble holding their urine in (incontinence), while others can't fully empty their bladder (retention).
Failing to empty the bladder completely raises the risk of developing a urinary tract infection (UTI), which can cause worsening of MS symptoms, as well as discomfort when urinating, needing to urinate frequently, and releasing only small amounts of urine.
If not treated quickly, a urinary tract infection can in turn lead to a kidney infection, which is a medical emergency.
Sometimes people with MS have trouble swallowing, known as dysphagia. When the timing of a swallow is off, or the muscles involved in swallowing are weak, foods and liquids may enter the airway instead of the esophagus, where they belong.
If the person cannot cough forcefully enough to expel them, the food and liquid can end up in the lungs. This can lead to aspiration pneumonia, a serious condition that can require hospitalization.
Symptoms of aspiration pneumonia may include chest pain, fever, shortness of breath, and coughing up foul-smelling phlegm. You should seek medical help if you experience these symptoms.
Many MS symptoms, including balance problems, muscle weakness, fatigue, dizziness, blurred vision, and numbness, raise the risk of falling.
Falls, in turn, raise the risk of serious injuries, such as broken bones and head trauma. Falling can also lead to fear of falling, which typically causes a person to become less active, weaker, and even more prone to falling.
While not all falls can be prevented, many can, through a range of strategies to build leg strength, improve balance, fall-proof your home, and address potential causes of dizziness.
People with MS who spend most of their time sitting or lying down need to be aware of — and take steps to prevent — pressure sores. Also known as bedsores or pressure ulcers, pressure sores are areas of damaged skin caused by applying pressure to the area for too long.
They tend to develop in areas where the bones are close to the skin, such as the heels, tailbone, shoulder blades, and elbows. A combination of moving more often, using special cushions or mattresses, and checking your skin every day can help to prevent pressure sores or catch them early.
Depression is common among people who have MS, and not just because it’s stressful to have an unpredictable, progressive disease.
Depression in MS may be a direct result of the immune system's attack on the protective myelin sheaths that envelop nerve fibers, causing behavioral changes, including depression.
Multiple sclerosis can also change what is known as the body's neuroendocrine system, which oversees hormone release, including hormones implicated in depression, such as serotonin.
Additionally, the medicines used to treat MS, such as interferon beta, can also cause depression.
And sometimes depression develops as a result of the stresses and challenges associated with having MS.
The good news: No matter what its underlying cause, depression in people with MS can be treated with psychotherapy, medication, or a combination of the two.
The effects of MS — its symptoms and their severity — vary greatly from person to person. How MS will affect any one person is impossible to predict.
Although MS can sometimes be a debilitating disease, the majority of people who have it don't become severely disabled, according to the National MS Society.
Many people with MS are able to maintain their mobility with the help of assistive devices, such as canes or crutches, often supplemented with scooters or motorized wheelchairs for long distances. About a third of people with MS completely lose their ability to walk.
People with MS who have the best prognosis are usually those who:
Studies that have examined causes of death among people with MS have found pulmonary (lung) infections to be a primary cause of excessive death in this population, and one study found that sepsis is a major cause of MS-related deaths. (6,7)
Sepsis is a life-threatening, whole-body inflammation that is triggered by a severe infection. It most commonly occurs in people with a weakened immune system.
But with better treatments now available for MS, the gap in life expectancy for people with MS may decrease. There are now several MS medications that can slow the progression of the disease and reduce the frequency and severity of relapses.
Treating MS involves treating relapses — acute episodes of inflammation — usually with high doses of steroids; using disease-modifying therapies to prevent relapses and disease progression; and treating the symptoms of MS using medication, physical therapy, other types of rehabilitative therapies, a healthy lifestyle, complementary treatments, and often counseling for depression or anxiety.
For people who have relapsing-remitting MS, a handful of disease-modifying drugs can slow the progression of multiple sclerosis and lower the frequency and severity of acute attacks. For people with primary-progressive MS (PPMS), only one medication, Ocrevus (ocrelizumab), has been shown to reduce the likelihood of disability progression.
MS is not a rare disease, but it’s not that common, either. It’s no surprise, then, that many people know very little about it, and that sometimes what they know is wrong. In addition, scientists’ understanding of MS — what raises the risk of getting it, how best to treat it, and how to live well with it — has advanced considerably in recent years. So even some doctors may hold outdated beliefs about MS. For people who live with the disease, it’s important to know what’s what.
A healthy diet for people with multiple sclerosis is not that different from a healthy diet for anyone. Basic good nutrition — sufficient calories from a mix of lean proteins, whole-grain carbohydrate sources, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats (from fish, nuts, seeds, and oil) — can go a long way toward maintaining your energy levels and helping to prevent such chronic diseases as type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Certain foods may also help manage symptoms associated with MS, such as high-fiber foods helping to relieve constipation.
When you have MS, connecting with others who have it can be therapeutic. Numerous organizations exist to help bring people with MS together, provide information about MS, and support scientific research that’s aimed at improving MS treatment and may one day lead to a cure. Other organizations have the mission of helping individuals find financial assistance for their medical needs.

Google will make to request transportation via mobile devices much easier with the latest update of their Google Maps app, in which you’ll be able to order a cab without leaving the app.
Previously, the app could only give you an estimate of the fair price and help you through the first steps of the process, but with this update, now you will able to complete the full process.
This capability will be part of the redesign ride services area of the application, in which instead of a list of services, you will see an on-screen map with the nearby drivers. Also, there’s no word about when or if it ever will include other transportation alternatives like Lyft again as an option. Users will also get important functionalities like, for example, choosing the type of car that you need for the service (POOL, uberX, uberXL, SELECT, BLACK o LUX).
Using the new option is super simple. You just need to sign in with your Uber account, and that’s pretty much it, you’ll be ready to request your Uber.
While this can translate into a boost for the application’s traffic, usage, and presence, the people from Uber will

Hi and welcome to my cooking portion! I am so happy some of you are interested with my simple home-cooked meals! They are boring, I may have to tell you in advance as I don't include much seafood in any of my recipe because...I am allergic to it!
So recently, I am really into potatoes and corn combo! Thankfully, the household love this combination as well so I've decided to create my own "Potato Croquettes" as side dish, since I got leftover corn kernels from recent cooking, I've decided to add in for some extra crunch and sweetness. Feel free to change the ingredients to ham, bacon or just leave it to plain potato croquettes!
- Corn kernels (optional)
- Corn starch
- Al

Fleas are a serious and potentially dangerous outdoor pest. These parasites bite and drink blood from both human and animal hosts, sometimes transmitting deadly bacteria that can lead to devastating illnesses.
While there are several flea-repellent methods and remedies you can use to help control fleas and protect your family and pets, it can be tricky to get rid of fleas entirely from around your property.
Because fleas are so common, and because they may be more common in some regions than others, it’s important to have a good game plan for flea protection and control. This is especially true when it comes to protecting your pets.
Both dogs and cats can be victims of flea bites, especially if they are unprotected with flea medications or flea collars. However, cats tend to be most at risk for flea infestations and flea bites, especially outdoor cats who spend the majority of their time in areas where wild animals may roam and transmit fleas.
In today’s article, we are going to talk about the best cat flea shampoo to help protect your cat. But before we begin, let’s first take a moment to talk about fleas.
Let’s get started!
But First, Let’s Talk About Fleas
Unprotected cats are commonly prone to suffering from fleas and flea bites.
Fleas are small, parasitic insects that live in grassy areas like woodlands, fields, and backyards. They have no wings and thus they cannot fly, but these pests can jump. In fact, fleas can jump up to 200 times their body size, which is about 13 inches.
Fleas also contain small barbs on their legs that help them cling to hosts, and they survive on blood hosts that include mammals like humans, wild animals, and pets like cats and dogs.
There are over 2,000 different species of fleas across the world, and they are problematic in nearly every continent except for Antarctica.
Though not all fleas are deadly, some can be. In the United States, fleas are known to carry some serious diseases that they can spread to both people and pets.
The most common flea in the United States is known as the “cat flea”, or the Ctenocephalides felis. The cat flea, in spite of its name, can be problematic for a variety of animals and sometimes even people.
But where do fleas come from?
Most cats will pick up fleas while outdoors, but outdoor cats are not the only cats at risk for fleas and fleabites. Even indoor cats can be at risk for fleas, especially if other pets bring fleas indoors, or if you bring our cat outdoors to play in the yard or go on a walk. It takes only a moment to pick up a flea, and a single pregnant flea can lead to an entire infestation on your cat or inside your home.
Fleas often find their way into your yard or property after being brought there by wild animals. Wild animal hosts for fleas include a number of animals like raccoons, deer, rabbits, mice, squirrels, rats, and more.
This means that even if you are vigilant and take care to keep your yard flea-free, you can never be certain that fleas are not on your property from one moment to the next.
If a cat picks up fleas, they could potentially bring them into your home and transmit them to other pets in the house and even to you or your loved ones.
Though fleas are incredibly small, they can have a big impact on the health of our furry family members and even on us.
Keep reading more to learn about the dangers of fleas to people and pets.
The Dangers Of Fleas For Cats, Dogs, And Even People
Unprotected cats can transmit fleas to people and other pets in the home.
As we just mentioned, fleas are a serious problem in not only the United States but also the world. Not only are fleas serious pests, but they are also quite dangerous. Fleas can carry and transmit a number of deadly diseases to both people and pets, including diseases like Murine Typhus, Tularemia, Bubonic Plague, and Tungiasis.
Of these diseases, the most common disease transmitted by fleas to cats in the United States is Murine Typhus.
Murine Typhus is caused due to Rickettsia typhi, a bacteria that is carried by infected wild animals, and even feral cats. Wild animals that can carry Rickettsia typhi tend to include animals like rats, opossums, raccoons, and other common wild animals that live in both suburban and urban areas.
Cat typhus, also known as feline panleukopenia, has a wide variety of symptoms that can range from mild to severe. Symptoms can take up to seven days to present themselves in your cat, and they include nausea, diarrhea, shivering, fever, vomiting, lethargy, and loss of appetite.
Typhus can be deadly in cats, but it is also treatable if you recognize the symptoms quickly. Most importantly, typhus is preventable when you utilize the tools and medications provided by your veterinarian, as well as other forms of pest control to repel and manage fleas in the area.
With that in mind, it’s time to talk about cat flea shampoo.
What Is Cat Flea Shampoo And Does It Really Work?
Cat shampoos can work to prevent and protect your cat from fleas when used properly.
Cat flea shampoo can be somewhat controversial, depending on who you speak with. While many people rave about cat flea shampoo products, not everyone agrees that cat flea shampoos are the best forms of flea prevention or protection for cats.
With that being said, there are some cat flea shampoo products that have proven effective against fleas and ticks, and some shampoos can even provide a longer-lasting solution to flea prevention than typical pet shampoos.
Cat flea shampoo products work most often by utilizing chemical ingredients designed to kill fleas and ticks on contact. Many of these types of cat flea shampoo products can take up to 48 hours to work, but they are often made to kill fleas, eggs, and nymphs, as well as other pests like lice.
Some cat flea shampoo products work only to kill fleas on contact once your cat has already contracted fleas. Other cat flea shampoo products can help to protect your cat from fleas for up to 28 days after application.
We should note here that most cat flea shampoo products contain chemical ingredients like insecticides, which can have adverse side effects on your cat. If you’re concerned about using a cat flea shampoo that contains insecticide chemicals, you can try using natural cat flea shampoo products that work using special oils and other natural, plant-based ingredients.
However, some natural cat flea shampoo products may not be as effective as chemical cat flea shampoo products, and it’s important to do your research before deciding which option is best for you and your cat.
Furthermore, sensitive cats can still have an adverse reaction to natural products as well. If you’re not sure about the best type of flea prevention and protection for your cat, it’s best to speak with a trusted veterinarian.
However, if you have decided that cat flea shampoo is the best option for you and your furry friend, we have listed several of our top-rated products below.
Take a look.
The Best Cat Flea Shampoo, According To Experts
It should be noted that not all cat shampoos for fleas are safe for kittens under the age of 12 weeks.
Remember, not all cat flea shampoo products are designed to work equally. Furthermore, many cat flea shampoo products work using chemical ingredients.
When you are looking for a cat flea shampoo for your unique pet, be sure to read the ingredients and consider the unique sensitivities of your cat.
Also, be aware that not all cat flea shampoo products work to provide long-term protection from fleas and ticks. When deciding which product you want to use to protect your pet, it’s important to consider your cat’s lifestyle, how often your cat is outside, and whether or not your cat is sensitive to certain ingredients.
Last, be sure to speak with your veterinarian about other forms of flea and tick protection and control, especially if you live in a region that is known for its prevalence of fleas and ticks.
Now, without further ado, let’s take a look at some of the best cat flea s

1. Item operates on a standard 3-pin plug. We can change it to a 15A (round plug) if required. Kindly let us know in the remarks when buying.
2. As item is designed for fast heating (2,300W), multi-plugging is not recommended. If the fryer unit "trips" your power supply, it likely means that your socket does not have sufficient power for the fryer. Use another socket instead.
3. Warranty: 3 Months Warranty on Heating Element Against Manufacturer's Defect.

I’ve heard from one student that Windows Movie Maker may have trouble importing the downloaded internet video files. Dr Andy recommends the K-Lite Codec pack which will add support for playing most video types (but might nag you to edit your Windows Registry, ugh).
The other option is to convert the videos you downloaded to AVI, which Movie Maker can open- you can use MPEG stream clip to export to AVI – or google around a bit for free avi converters (there are online tools and downloadable ones)

So, a little blogging this morning followed by some pampering at the hairdressers followed by some lunch and an overly large glass of wine.
I’ve been playing around on the internet ever since, mainly Tumblr and Youtube and in doing so I found a couple of videos i’d book marked a while ago.
Anyone who reads my blog will know I currently have quite a thing for Domhnall Gleeson (second to Adam Driver) and that General Hux gets me quite hot under the collar.
I also have a thing for Panic at the Disco. My current favourite car sounds that I loved to rock out to, especially when I’m on my own.
Now, one of my favourite Panic at the Disco tracks is Emperor’s New Clothes.
Every word uttered in this track makes me think of General Hux because

------------question-----------------------
What are some common symptoms that may affect people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and what complications can arise from these symptoms
------------correct----------------------
0 percent of them, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.
Some people have trouble holding their urine in (incontinence), while others can't fully empty their bladder (retention).
Failing to empty the bladder completely raises the risk of developing a urinary tract infection (UTI), which can cause worsening of MS symptoms, as well as discomfort when urinating, needing to urinate frequently, and releasing only small amounts of urine.
If not treated quickly, a urinary tract infection can in turn lead to a kidney infection, which is a medical emergency.
Sometimes people with MS have trouble swallowing, known as dysphagia. When the timing of a swallow is off, or the muscles involved in swallowing are weak, foods and liquids may enter the airway instead of the esophagus, where they belong.
If the person cannot cough forcefully enough to expel them, the food and liquid can end up in the lungs. This can lead to aspiration pneumonia, a serious condition that can require hospitalization.
Symptoms of aspiration pneumonia may include chest pain, fever, shortness of breath, and coughing up foul-smelling phlegm. You should seek medical help if you experience these symptoms.
Many MS symptoms, including balance problems, muscle weakness, fatigue, dizziness, blurred vision, and numbness, raise the risk of falling.
Falls, in turn, raise the risk of serious injuries, such as broken bones and head trauma. Falling can also lead to fear of falling, which typically causes a person to become less active, weaker, and even more prone to falling.
While not all falls can be prevented, many can, through a range of strategies to build leg strength, improve balance, fall-proof your home, and address potential causes of dizziness.
People with MS who spend most of their time sitting or lying down need to be aware of — and take steps to prevent — pressure sores. Also known as bedsores or pressure ulcers, pressure sores are areas of damaged skin caused by applying pressure to the area for too long.
They tend to develop in areas where the bones are close to the skin, such as the heels, tailbone, shoulder blades, and elbows. A combination of moving more often, using special cushions or mattresses, and checking your skin every day can help to prevent pressure sores or catch them early.
Depression is common among people who have MS, and not just because it’s stressful to have an unpredictable, progressive disease.
Depression in MS may be a direct result of the immune system's attack on the protective myelin sheaths that envelop nerve fibers, causing behavioral changes, including depression.
Multiple sclerosis can also change what is known as the body's neuroendocrine system, which oversees hormone release, including hormones implicated in depression, such as serotonin.
Additionally, the medicines used to treat MS, such as interferon beta, can also cause depression.
And sometimes depression develops as a result of the stresses and challenges associated with having MS.
The good news: No matter what its underlying cause, depression in people with MS can be treated with psychotherapy, medication, or a combination of the two.
The effects of MS — its symptoms and their severity — vary greatly from person to person. How MS will affect any one person is impossible to predict.
Although MS can sometimes be a debilitating disease, the majority of people who have it don't become severely disabled, according to the National MS Society.
Many people with MS are able to maintain their mobility with the help of assistive devices, such as canes or crutches, often supplemented with scooters or motorized wheelchairs for long distances. About a third of people with MS completely lose their ability to walk.
People with MS who have the best prognosis are usually those who:
Studies that have examined causes of death among people with MS have found pulmonary (lung) infections to be a primary cause of excessive death in this population, and one study found that sepsis is a major cause of MS-related deaths. (6,7)
Sepsis is a life-threatening, whole-body inflammation that is triggered by a severe infection. It most commonly occurs in people with a weakened immune system.
But with better treatments now available for MS, the gap in life expectancy for people with MS may decrease. There are now several MS medications that can slow the progression of the disease and reduce the frequency and severity of relapses.
Treating MS involves treating relapses — acute episodes of inflammation — usually with high doses of steroids; using disease-modifying therapies to prevent relapses and disease progression; and treating the symptoms of MS using medication, physical therapy, other types of rehabilitative therapies, a healthy lifestyle, complementary treatments, and often counseling for depression or anxiety.
For people who have relapsing-remitting MS, a handful of disease-modifying drugs can slow the progression of multiple sclerosis and lower the frequency and severity of acute attacks. For people with primary-progressive MS (PPMS), only one medication, Ocrevus (ocrelizumab), has been shown to reduce the likelihood of disability progression.
MS is not a rare disease, but it’s not that common, either. It’s no surprise, then, that many people know very little about it, and that sometimes what they know is wrong. In addition, scientists’ understanding of MS — what raises the risk of getting it, how best to treat it, and how to live well with it — has advanced considerably in recent years. So even some doctors may hold outdated beliefs about MS. For people who live with the disease, it’s important to know what’s what.
A healthy diet for people with multiple sclerosis is not that different from a healthy diet for anyone. Basic good nutrition — sufficient calories from a mix of lean proteins, whole-grain carbohydrate sources, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats (from fish, nuts, seeds, and oil) — can go a long way toward maintaining your energy levels and helping to prevent such chronic diseases as type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Certain foods may also help manage symptoms associated with MS, such as high-fiber foods helping to relieve constipation.
When you have MS, connecting with others who have it can be therapeutic. Numerous organizations exist to help bring people with MS together, provide information about MS, and support scientific research that’s aimed at improving MS treatment and may one day lead to a cure. Other organizations have the mission of helping individuals find financial assistance for their medical needs.

0 percent of them, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.
Some people have trouble holding their urine in (incontinence), while others can't fully empty their bladder (retention).
Failing to empty the bladder completely raises the risk of developing a urinary tract infection (UTI), which can cause worsening of MS symptoms, as well as discomfort when urinating, needing to urinate frequently, and releasing only small amounts of urine.
If not treated quickly, a urinary tract infection can in turn lead to a kidney infection, which is a medical emergency.
Sometimes people with MS have trouble swallowing, known as dysphagia. When the timing of a swallow is off, or the muscles involved in swallowing are weak, foods and liquids may enter the airway instead of the esophagus, where they belong.
If the person cannot cough forcefully enough to expel them, the food and liquid can end up in the lungs. This can lead to aspiration pneumonia, a serious condition that can require hospitalization.
Symptoms of aspiration pneumonia may include chest pain, fever, shortness of breath, and coughing up foul-smelling phlegm. You should seek medical help if you experience these symptoms.
Many MS symptoms, including balance problems, muscle weakness, fatigue, dizziness, blurred vision, and numbness, raise the risk of falling.
Falls, in turn, raise the risk of serious injuries, such as broken bones and head trauma. Falling can also lead to fear of falling, which typically causes a person to become less active, weaker, and even more prone to falling.
While not all falls can be prevented, many can, through a range of strategies to build leg strength, improve balance, fall-proof your home, and address potential causes of dizziness.
People with MS who spend most of their time sitting or lying down need to be aware of — and take steps to prevent — pressure sores. Also known as bedsores or pressure ulcers, pressure sores are areas of damaged skin caused by applying pressure to the area for too long.
They tend to develop in areas where the bones are close to the skin, such as the heels, tailbone, shoulder blades, and elbows. A combination of moving more often, using special cushions or mattresses, and checking your skin every day can help to prevent pressure sores or catch them early.
Depression is common among people who have MS, and not just because it’s stressful to have an unpredictable, progressive disease.
Depression in MS may be a direct result of the immune system's attack on the protective myelin sheaths that envelop nerve fibers, causing behavioral changes, including depression.
Multiple sclerosis can also change what is known as the body's neuroendocrine system, which oversees hormone release, including hormones implicated in depression, such as serotonin.
Additionally, the medicines used to treat MS, such as interferon beta, can also cause depression.
And sometimes depression develops as a result of the stresses and challenges associated with having MS.
The good news: No matter what its underlying cause, depression in people with MS can be treated with psychotherapy, medication, or a combination of the two.
The effects of MS — its symptoms and their severity — vary greatly from person to person. How MS will affect any one person is impossible to predict.
Although MS can sometimes be a debilitating disease, the majority of people who have it don't become severely disabled, according to the National MS Society.
Many people with MS are able to maintain their mobility with the help of assistive devices, such as canes or crutches, often supplemented with scooters or motorized wheelchairs for long distances. About a third of people with MS completely lose their ability to walk.
People with MS who have the best prognosis are usually those who:
Studies that have examined causes of death among people with MS have found pulmonary (lung) infections to be a primary cause of excessive death in this population, and one study found that sepsis is a major cause of MS-related deaths. (6,7)
Sepsis is a life-threatening, whole-body inflammation that is triggered by a severe infection. It most commonly occurs in people with a weakened immune system.
But with better treatments now available for MS, the gap in life expectancy for people with MS may decrease. There are now several MS medications that can slow the progression of the disease and reduce the frequency and severity of relapses.
Treating MS involves treating relapses — acute episodes of inflammation — usually with high doses of steroids; using disease-modifying therapies to prevent relapses and disease progression; and treating the symptoms of MS using medication, physical therapy, other types of rehabilitative therapies, a healthy lifestyle, complementary treatments, and often counseling for depression or anxiety.
For people who have relapsing-remitting MS, a handful of disease-modifying drugs can slow the progression of multiple sclerosis and lower the frequency and severity of acute attacks. For people with primary-progressive MS (PPMS), only one medication, Ocrevus (ocrelizumab), has been shown to reduce the likelihood of disability progression.

Dartford MP slams "poor" Southeastern's passenger repayment service
PUBLISHED: 09:35 04 March 2016 | UPDATED: 09:47 04 March 2016
The comments came in a debate on Wednesday
Rail service Southeastern has been criticised by Dartford’s MP Gareth Johnson, who said the company had “all but given up on getting its franchise renewed.”
At a House of Commons debate on Wednesday, Mr Johnson asked the rail minister, Claire Perry, to consider the way the company’s ‘delay repay’ scheme works.
It currently compensates passengers who have suffered a 30 minute delay.
But Mr Johnson believes the rail service should offer repayment after 15 minutes.
The Conservative MP said: “Southeastern’s performance this year has so far been particularly poor. Their trains are consistently late, are cancelled or miss stops.
“It is not good enough. There has to be a fairer compensation system for passengers when delays occur.
“A fifteen-minute delay is still significant and so compensation should begin at that point rather than the current thirty minutes.
“We should not allow for trains to be delayed for say 25 minutes without there being any consequence for Southeastern.”

Still can’t make it past the host stand at Graydon Carter’s Waverly Inn? No luck scoring a decent table at Minetta Tavern between 5:30 and 11pm? Take heart, scenester. The Lion is much less likely to turn you away. The latest addition to the new power pantheon may be Gotham’s most democratic high-profile restaurant. While the Waverly features just a tiny lounge to accommodate gawkers and won’t take reservations by phone, the bar at the Lion is surrounded by tables for walk-ins, and the phone lines are wide open.
Though you may still have a tough time landing a prime table for dinner—we managed to snag seats pretty easily on a Sunday evening—the reception is uncharacteristically warm for a place seeking Page Six immortality. Our waiter was so genial, he could have been stolen from a Danny Meyer establishment. A bartender on another evening was just as fraternal, pouring a generous drink while gushing over the burger I’d ordered. This despite a crush of publishing minions fighting their way to the bar—necks craning to catch a glimpse of every arrival—while co-owner and Men’s Health editor Dave Zinczenko held court among them.
While the magazine honcho is a partner in the Lion with NBC’s Dan Abrams, this is first and foremost a John DeLucie establishment. The chef—still the co-owner of the Waverly—is an imposing presence, greeting friends in the dining room one minute, expediting dishes the next.
His new restaurant, inspired by the West Village landmark that thrived at this brownstone locale in the ’60s (also the gay joint where Barbra Streisand made her singing debut), offers a reimagining of that bohemian haunt. The dining room is decked out in an eclectic montage of modern masterworks, Daily News crime snaps, and portraits of bearded men.
Like the city’s other clubby spots, the food takes a backseat to the scene. Which isn’t to say that it’s not often delicious. Like the Minetta Tavern’s straightforward menu, the selections are all fairly classic, and for the most part, exceptionally well done.
DeLucie’s continental cuisine—old-fashioned with modern finesse—looks to Spain, France, Italy and the U.S. Artichoke fritters are actually crispy tapas-style croquettes oozing lemony bchamel. Green and white matchstick asparagus with optimal snap are paired, in another straight-up starter, with velvety hollandaise sauce and an egg so delicately poached, the yolk practically breaks itself.

nancial Tips and Ideas from WireLend:
Don't Save Your Credit Card Numbers On Your Online Accounts
When your credit card numbers are saved to your online accounts, it's a lot easier to impulse buy when your information is already handy and just a click away. The best way to break Online impulse shopping is to simply remove your credit card numbers from your online accounts. That way when you're tempted to spend you'll be forced to get up and seek out your credit card, forcing you to really think whether or not you really need the item you've been window shopping.
Save Your Earned Income Credit
Income tax season is the check some of us look forward to each year. Before you make any plans about what you want to buy, consider saving all the money you’re getting back from Uncle Sam. Actually, don’t use that money at all. Let it marinate in your bank account or set up an IRA. Income tax money is a good boost to your overall balance in the bank. Take it a step further and complete your own taxes online. The instructions are simple and specific. The price is much cheaper than sitting in an office with a tax expert.

ile reducing costs--more simply put, doing more with less. A modern approach to enterprise technology, from the core architecture to the user experience, is required for all of those things.
You may have read in recent months about these transformations underway at European companies, with news articles on Grant Thornton, Diageo, Sanofi, and others. We'll hear from customers at Workday Rising Europe over the next few days on transformations taking place within their organisations, and several sessions in the programme are designed to help customers network with one another and share best practices in person.
We'll have exciting things to talk to attendees about, too, such as Workday Big Data Analytics and updates on Workday Payroll for UK, Workday Payroll for France, Workday Recruiting, and our next update, Workday 22. And of course, we'll have plenty of discussions around using Workday Human Capital Management and Financial Management to improve processes, work more efficiently, and gain more insights within customer organisations.
I'm looking forward to a fantastic Workday Rising Europe, and to a year of strong growth in the European region for our company. We have a huge opportunity before us, and the best is yet to come. Day by day, we are welcoming new citizens to the cloud.

------------question-----------------------
What significant contributions did Jackie Chan make for disaster relief in the first eight months of 2010
------------correct----------------------
Action star Jackie Chan’s high-speed activity doesn’t stop when the cameras do. An enthusiastic supporter of hundreds of charities including UNICEF, Operation Smile and his own Jackie Chan Charitable Foundation, Chan offers the Look To The Stars writers an incredible challenge just trying to keep on top of his good works!
Chan spends countless hours helping others, and has been known to drop everything to find out how he can be of service after disasters strike. He raises millions of dollars to help those in need. In the first 8 months of 2010, he raised $36 million to help people across the globe, from Haiti to Singapore:
- Donated 5 million RMB (US $732,000) to help Haiti earthquake victims.
- Worked with WildAid to support preservation of endangered tigers.
- Donation of school supplies to “Charming Schools” in China
- Raised US $5.2 million in donations for the Singapore Thong Chai Medical Institution
- Helped raise US 29 million for drought relief in China.
- Visited Qinghai, China to bring food, water, and supplies to victims of the April 14, 6.9 magnitude earthquake
- Participated in the “Artistes 414 Fundraising Campaign” concert to raise money for victims of the April 14th earthquake in China
- Charity mission to Tongren in the Guizhou province of China to bring much-needed water and supplies to the drought stricken area.
2009 saw Chan using much of his spare time to visit the remotest parts of China on his Dragon’s Heart Charity Missions.
The Dragon's Heart Foundation strives to meet the needs of poverty-stricken children and the elderly in the hardest-to-reach areas of the immense country. Chan has made several trips to villages in these remote locations, bringing warm clothing, wheelchairs and school supplies, and helping to build schools.
In February of 2008, the Rush Hour star was on hand to donate 450 down coats to The Salvation Army for victims of the China snowstorms, and since 2004, Jackie’s charity has built 20 Dragon’s Heart Schools, providing education to some of China’s poorest citizens.
“Before, I didn’t like charity. I just wanted to be famous and to earn more money,” says Chan. “My friends taught me and now I like to do charity. Even when I am sleeping, I think how I can help other people. Every human being has to learn how to do charity.”
Jackie founded the Jackie Chan Charitable Foundation in 1988 to help young people in a variety of worthy causes, including medical services, aid to victims of natural disaster or illness, scholarships and youth activities.
Upon hearing about the 2007 Yunnan earthquake, Jackie immediately began making phone calls to find out what supplies were needed and how he could help.
In 2006, Chan:
- Made a considerable donation to the Civil Aviation Institute in Guanghan, China to fund programs for student pilots and airline staff
- Filmed a Public Service Announcement to warn children about the dangers of Avian Flu
- Visited the Yunan Province of China for the opening cerem

------------question-----------------------
What are the common early symptoms experienced by people diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS)
------------correct----------------------
Multiple sclerosis, or MS, is a disease of the central nervous system that can cause symptoms throughout the body. Most experts believe it is an autoimmune condition, in which the immune system mistakenly attacks normal tissues in the body.
In the case of MS, the immune system attacks the myelin sheath that normally protects nerve fibers in the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve. The underlying nerve fibers can also be damaged or destroyed in this attack.
As the attack progresses, the myelin sheath becomes inflamed and gradually is destroyed, leaving areas of patchy scar tissue (sclerosis) that disrupt the electrical impulses between the brain and other parts of the body.
The term “multiple sclerosis” refers to the multiple areas of scar tissue — often called “lesions” — that develop along affected nerve fibers and that are visible in MRI scans. The literal meaning of “sclerosis” is “pathological hardening of tissue.”
The lesions caused by MS, and the resulting disruption of nerve impulses throughout the body, are what cause most of the symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis.
The nerve damage that occurs in MS can lead to a broad variety of symptoms. Some common early symptoms include visual problems, difficulties with balance and walking, numbness and tingling, and heat intolerance.
Less common symptoms include problems speaking or swallowing, itchy skin or altered sensations, and tremor.
In making an MS diagnosis, a doctor considers a person’s history of symptoms, along with the results of MRI scans and other medical tests.
The cause of MS is unknown — no one knows what sets off the immune reaction that leads to MS lesions in the first place. But it is thought that some combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental causes is necessary to trigger the disease.
Some researchers suspect the immune attack is triggered by certain kinds of viral infections. Others point to low vitamin D levels as a contributing cause. Cigarette smoking is also known to raise the risk of developing MS. (1)
Because there’s no national registry for multiple sclerosis, the true prevalence of MS in the United States is unknown. Most organizations estimate it at 400,000, but new research suggests the number of Americans with MS may be closer to 1 million.
Most people who are diagnosed with MS have no known risk factors. Approximately 20 percent of people with MS have a family member who has it, but even having an identical twin with MS increases the risk by only 20 to 40 percent. So even though having a family history of MS raises the risk somewhat, MS is not considered a genetic or hereditary disease.
Some other risk factors for MS include being a woman, vitamin D deficiency, obesity, having an autoimmune condition, smoking, exposure to the Epstein-Barr virus, having multiple concussions during adolescence, and living further away from the equator.
While anyone can develop MS, many of those who have it share the following characteristics:
Age The majority experience their first symptoms between the ages of 20 and 40.
Race Caucasians have long been believed to be more than twice as likely as other races to develop MS. But the underrepresentation of racial and ethnic minorities in clinical trials calls this belief into question.
Gender MS is two to three times more common in women as in men. (2)
Climate MS is five times more common in temperate climates — like the northern United States, Canada, and Europe — than in tropical climates.
Genes People whose close relatives have MS are more susceptible to developing the disease, but there is no evidence the disease is directly inherited.
Scientists have long described different types of MS, the most common being relapsing-remitting MS, primary-progressive MS, and secondary-progressive MS. But in recent years there’s a growing consensus that these are not distinct types of MS, but rather points along a continuum. At some points, inflammation is the predominant characteristic of the disease, while at others, neurodegeneration — in which old injuries to the brain and spinal cord worsen — predominates.
Nonetheless, most people with MS are still diagnosed with a particular type of the disease.
This type of MS is characterized by periods of active inflammation in the central nervous system, during which symptoms worsen (and new symptoms may develop), alternating with periods when symptoms are less acute.
The times when symptoms worsen are known as relapses, flares, or exacerbations. As a relapse ends, the severity of symptoms diminishes, but a person can be left with new, permanent symptoms.
The quiet periods between relapses are called remissions. Remissions may last for months or years before a relapse occurs.
RRMS is the most common type of MS — estimates vary, but between 80 and 90 percent of people with MS are diagnosed with this relapsing-remitting course of the disease, and most people with RRMS eventually develop secondary-progressive MS.
This type of MS is generally considered a second phase of RRMS, in which there is symptom progression and increased disability. People with SPMS may continue to have relapses, although they may be less frequent than in RRMS.
Most people who are diagnosed with RRMS will eventually transition to SPMS, but each person’s experience with it — whether or not they have relapses and how much progression, or disease worsening, occurs — will be unique.
In PPMS there is no initial relapse that signals the beginning of the disease. Instead, MS symptoms gradually appear over time.
Those who have PPMS generally do not experience acute exacerbations or have distinct remissions, but they may have temporary plateaus during which symptoms lessen somewhat.
About 10 to 15 percent of people with MS are diagnosed with PPMS, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine.
A small percentage of people with MS have a benign form of the disease, in which symptoms progress very little over the course of a person's lifetime, after the initial attack.
There’s some controversy over how (or whether) to classify people with benign MS, since the progress of the disease can vary over a person’s lifetime, according to the National MS Society.
A small number of people with MS have malignant MS, which is marked by the rapid formation of lesions in the brain and spine, causing severe symptoms, disability, and possibly death.
Beyond the direct effects of MS symptoms — of which there are many and of varying severity — there can be additional consequences of some symptoms.
Bladder problems are very common in people with MS, affecting at least 8

Southeastern said: “The specification and letting of rail contracts is a matter for government. We are focused on working with Network Rail – who are responsible for infrastructure such as the track and signalling - to deliver an improved service for passengers.
“Under our current contract with the Department for Transport, we will be investing more than £70m in better services, including refurbishing trains and stations, more employees at our stations and better quality information.
“We will now work closely with the Department for Transport and Transport for London as they develop these proposals further.
“The Delay Repay scheme offering compensation to passengers delayed by 30 mins or more is approved by the Department for Transport and hardwired into our franchise agreement. Any changes to this scheme are a matter for the Department for Transport rather than individual operators and we will wait for further information from them.
“We look at all compensation claims on a case by case basis and additional goodwill gestures are paid to passengers who are excessively delayed, held on trains for lengthy periods or who occur expenses that are within our responsibility.

When did WHO first learn about the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19
------------correct----------------------
COVID-19 is the disease caused by a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. WHO first learned of this new virus on 31 December 2019, following a report of a cluster of cases of ‘viral pneumonia’ in Wuhan, People’s Republic of China.
Among those who develop symptoms, most (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. About 15% become seriously ill and require oxygen and 5% become critically ill and need intensive care.
Complications leading to death may include respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, thromboembolism, and/or multiorgan failure, including i

Workday Rising Europe: Welcoming New Citizens to the Cloud
Today we are hosting the first Workday Rising Europe in London, designed specifically for our customers in Europe. This event will also benefit others wanting to learn more about Workday from our team members and customers.
It's also my first Workday Rising! Having heard about these legendary customer events in the U.S., I know our London gathering will be a great one. The interest in Workday Rising Europe among customers and prospective customers has exceeded our expectations, and all of us at Workday are incredibly honoured by such enthusiasm.
Yet I'm not surprised. I joined Workday earlier this year as president, EMEA, attracted by the company's culture, strategy, and market opportunity. Two months later, what I find most inspiring about Workday is our customers. I've met with many of them since January, and I'm amazed by their excitement and willingness to share how they're using and benefitting from Workday. It's clear that the Workday real cloud and our power of one play an important part in their desire to share experiences as citizens of the cloud. I have no doubt the customer panels at Workday Rising Europe will be the highlight of the event!
I also think our European customers realise they're helping drive significant change across their regions and industries.

It’s hard to believe that it’s been 20 years, but it has. I wrote what has become my signature song, “Draw Me Close, in January of 1994. I came home from church on a Sunday, January 9th to be exact, and felt somewhat discouraged.
Here’s the final promo video for The Noël Project. This one features short clips from all the songs on the Project. Enjoy!
Here’s another promo video for The Noël Project. This one features us working on a little ditty called “Jingle This”, a fun retro-Motown/hip-hop groove with the refrain from “Angels We Have Heard On High” whistled by a small cadre of angelic fans. Please share with your friends. Everybody wants more holiday music.
We are quite happy to announce that the first promotional video is out for Kelly’s upcoming holiday release “The Noël Project”. Take a look and share, share, share with your friends. Slated for a November 15 release date, we will start taking pre-orders in mid-October. Enjoy!
I’m scouring the continents for people who would like to add some whistling to this track. That’s right, I would like you to whistle on my upcoming holiday record, The Noël Project.
Work on The Noël Project, the upcoming holiday album, is coming along nicely. Please enjoy a rough mix of Kelly’s adaptation of Bach’s “Jesu Joy of Man’s Desiring”.
Have a listen to the first taste of my upcoming Christmas record, codenamed “Project Noël”. Yes, it may be the end of July, but I’m visualizing mistletoe and sugar plum fairies.
Here is one of those improvisational piano pieces I came up with that I later added some atmospheric pads and woodwinds to.

What type of applications does Workday provide, and which sectors do they cater to
------------correct----------------------
ile reducing costs--more simply put, doing more with less. A modern approach to enterprise technology, from the core architecture to the user experience, is required for all of those things.
You may have read in recent months about these transformations underway at European companies, with news articles on Grant Thornton, Diageo, Sanofi, and others. We'll hear from customers at Workday Rising Europe over the next few days on transformations taking place within their organisations, and several sessions in the programme are designed to help customers network with one another and share best practices in person.
We'll have exciting things to talk to attendees about, too, such as Workday Big Data Analytics and updates on Workday Payroll for UK, Workday Payroll for France, Workday Recruiting, and our next update, Workday 22. And of course, we'll have plenty of discussions around using Workday Human Capital Management and Financial Management to improve processes, work more efficiently, and gain more insights within customer organisations.
I'm looking forward to a fantastic Workday Rising Europe, and to a year of strong growth in the European region for our company. We have a huge opportunity before us, and the best is yet to come. Day by day, we are welcoming new citizens to the cloud.

What is the power requirement for the fryer and what happens if it's plugged into an insufficient socket
------------correct----------------------
mH
Capacity: 4.5L to 5L
Temperature: +70 degC to +180degC
Power: 220-240V/2,300 Watts (3-Pin Plug)
Wire Mesh Basket x 1, Oil Tank Cover x 1, SS Base Grate x 1
1. Item operates on a standard 3-pin plug. We can change it to a 15A (round plug) if required. Kindly let us know in the remarks when buying.
2. As item is designed for fast heating (2,300W), multi-plugging is not recommended. If the fryer unit "trips" your power supply, it likely means that your socket does not have sufficient power for the fryer. Use another socket instead.
3. Warranty: 3 Months Warranty on Heating Element Against Manufacturer's Defect.

------------question-----------------------
What is the release date for Kelly's upcoming holiday album 'The Noël Project'
------------correct----------------------
It’s hard to believe that it’s been 20 years, but it has. I wrote what has become my signature song, “Draw Me Close, in January of 1994. I came home from church on a Sunday, January 9th to be exact, and felt somewhat discouraged.
Here’s the final promo video for The Noël Project. This one features short clips from all the songs on the Project. Enjoy!
Here’s another promo video for The Noël Project. This one features us working on a little ditty called “Jingle This”, a fun retro-Motown/hip-hop groove with the refrain from “Angels We Have Heard On High” whistled by a small cadre of angelic fans. Please share with your friends. Everybody wants more holiday music.
We are quite happy to announce that the first promotional video is out for Kelly’s upcoming holiday release “The Noël Project”. Take a look and share, share, share with your friends. Slated for a November 15 release date, we will start taking pre-orders in mid-October. Enjoy!
I’m scouring the continents for people who would like to add some whistling to this track. That’s right, I would like you to whistle on my upcoming holiday record, The Noël Project.
Work on The Noël Project, the upcoming holiday album, is coming along nicely. Please enjoy a rough mix of Kelly’s adaptation of Bach’s “Jesu Joy of Man’s Desiring”.
Have a listen to the first taste of my upcoming Christmas record, codenamed “Project Noël”. Yes, it may be the end of July, but I’m visualizing mistletoe and sugar plum fairies.
Here is one of those improvisational piano pieces I came up with that I later added some atmospheric pads and woodwinds to.
Here is a sample

It’s hard to believe that it’s been 20 years, but it has. I wrote what has become my signature song, “Draw Me Close, in January of 1994. I came home from church on a Sunday, January 9th to be exact, and felt somewhat discouraged.
Here’s the final promo video for The Noël Project. This one features short clips from all the songs on the Project. Enjoy!
Here’s another promo video for The Noël Project. This one features us working on a little ditty called “Jingle This”, a fun retro-Motown/hip-hop groove with the refrain from “Angels We Have Heard On High” whistled by a small cadre of angelic fans.

SMO ‚Äî The papers are in and now we wait.
A motion to dismiss City Hall‚Äôs lawsuit against the Federal Aviation Administration over the future of Santa Monica Airport will not require a hearing.
Judge John F. Walter is opting to make a decision based on the written arguments filed by City Hall‚Äôs attorneys and the FAA, City Attorney Marsha Moutrie told the Daily Press.
In October, City Hall announced it would sue the federal government to retain full control of the airport‚Äôs future.
Neighboring residents have long complained about the noise and pollution created by the propellor planes and jets. Others fear for their safety, pointing out that the runway is only a few hundred feet from homes. In September, a jet veered off the runway into a hangar. The hangar caught fire causing the roof to collapse and all four aboard were killed.
City Hall owns the land but the FAA says that various agreements obligate the space to continue to operate as an airport.
Last month, the FAA asked the judge to toss the lawsuit, claiming that City Hall knew of the federal government‚Äôs intentions for the airport half a century ago. If City Hall wanted to sue, the FAA said, it should have been within 12 years of when they realized those intentions.
City Hall responded to the motion, pointing out that while they knew the federal government intended to operate SMO as an airport for decades, it was only a few years ago, in 2008, that they learned its intentions
