Bah humbug! The holiday season is the most magical time of the year for a lot of people, but some celebrities have more in common with Scrooge than Santa Claus.
Miley Cyrus has been candid about her struggles around Christmas and wants her fans to know they aren’t alone. The “Prisoner” singer shared a “Sad Christmas Song” in December 2019, which she penned during a lonely period in her life.
“A sad Christmas song I wrote a few years back right before the holidays,” Cyrus wrote via Instagram at the time. “Was feeling like s–t cause I couldn’t be with the one I loved. Even with a house full of family and friends I still felt alone. In ways that still feels relevant and someone reading this right now could possibly relate!”
She added, “If you feel lonely this season just know YOU ARE COMPLETELY MADE OF MAGIC! You are as special as a snowflake, beautifully unique and I hope inside your soul feels light, hope, peace, and joy knowing how singularly amazing YOU are! Love always wins!”
One year later, Cyrus revealed she wanted to have a “goth Christmas” vibe

Listen to this post
The battle between old-school nostalgia and modern gadgetry has been raging for centuries, but it seems to have reached a fever pitch in recent decades, given our rapid improvements in technology, increase in consumer demand, and cultural divides between old and new. Vinyl or MP3? Satellite or cable? Books or Kindles? Batman or Superman?
This struggle between modernity and tradition is particularly obvious in the world of film, where aging film buffs and modern indie film fans frequently duke it out over which type of film is better – 35 mm, 24mm, 70mm, IMAX, digital…?
With the recent resurgence of throwback film techniques (most notably, Quentin Tarantino’s use of 70mm film to shoot his 2015 western thriller The Hateful Eight – see the clip above), a whole new generation of people are being exposed to some nearly forgotten film styles, and an ancient debate is heating up once again.
What is 70mm Film?
As the advertisements for Tarantino’s latest film proudly proclaimed, the movie would be available for viewing in “Glorious 70mm – Ultra Panavision 70”, and most people had no idea what they meant. Well, 70mm is just another variety of analogue film, more specifically, a film reel with frames that are 70mm in width. The gauge for most motion pictures is 35mm, and while most movies are still wonderful to watch, the difference when you jump to a 70mm gauge is quite noticeable.
The resolution of 70mm film is much better than 35mm, providing a richer visual experience and extremely detailed images that are a joy to watch. This type of film also changes the aspect ratio of the film, stretching it to a wider 2.2:1 ratio, rather than the typical 1.35:1 (known as the Academy ratio) or 16:9 (widescreen ratio). This makes 70mm films ideal for larger and wider screens (for example, IMAX films shoot on a special type of 70mm film).
Now, it’s important to remember that Tarantino is far from the first person to use 70mm film for a movie; in fact, the technology dates back to the very beginning of cinema. Throughout film history, when a director wanted to shoot an epic film, such as Ben-Hur or Lawrence of Arabia, they would choose to shoot on 70mm film. This was perfect for the Panavision movie palaces that featured extremely wide screens and could accommodate the wider image of these early “blockbusters”. However, as the decades passed, movie theaters evolved (and shrank), the popularity of the lighter and less expensive 35mm film grew, and 70mm film fell from popularity, despite its undeniably better quality.
The equipment to transport, store, and play 70mm film was expensive, bulky, and difficult to manipulate, as were the cameras u

ame initial equation as above but now we replace the desired grade, D, with the Minimum Grade, Min, as shown below:
Min*WT = C*WC + F*WF = C*WC + 0%*WF = C*WC
Dividing WT by both sides and inputting the known terms, we thus have:
Min = C*WC / WT = 70% * 60% / 100% = (70*60/100) % = 42%
Maximum Possible Course Grade
The maximum possible course grade is for the case when you obtain 100% in the final exam, which when assuming there are no bonus marks, is the highest possible grade on the final exam. Also, the maximum possible course grade, Max, is shown below to be just simply the minimum possible course grade plus the weight of the final:
Max*WT = C*WC + F*WF = C*WC + 100% * WF
Dividing by WT , which is the equal to 100%, we obtain:
Max = C*WC / WT + 100% * WF / 100% = C*WC / WT + WF = Min + WF
Thus the Max is simply the Min plus the Weight of the Final and inputting the percentages we get:
Max = 42% + 40% = 82%
Option 2: You Don't Know your Current Grade
An example of our grade calculator for the case when you don’t know your Current Grade is shown below:
In this example, because the question "do you know your current grade?" is answered "no", an extra window appears which has a table that you can manually input all your course work grades and weights in terms of assignments, midterms, homework, labs, etc. Notice that when you input your scores, the grades automatically updates, and vice versa too if you input the grades then your scores automatically update too!
The only difference in this example from the example in Option 1 above is that the Current Grade and Weight of the Final are automatically calculated based on the course work that is inputted in the table. In this example, there are 4 assignments with grades 100%, 85%, 83.8%, and 75% along with their respective weights of 4%, 10%, 8%, and 20%.
The first calculation that is solved is the Weight of the Course Work, otherwise known earlier as the Weight of the Current Grade, WC, and that calculation is simply the sum of the weights of all the course work as shown below:
WC = W1 + W2 + W3 + W4 = (4 + 10 + 8 + 20) % = 42%
The Weight of the Final, WF, is calculated simply as the difference of the Total Weight, WT, and the Weight of the Current Grade:
WT = WC + WF
Rearranging to solve for WF and inputting the percentages we get:
WF = WT - WC = 100% - 42% = 58%
The next calculation solved is Current Grade, C, which solved as the weighted average of all the course work as shown below where the course work grades and weights are abbreviated as G1, G2, G3, G4 and W1, W2, W3, W4:
Dividing both sides by WC and inputting the percentages we obtain:
C = (G1*W1 + G2*W2 + G3*W3 + G4*W4 ) / WC = (100% * 4% + 85% * 10% + 83.8% * 8% + 75% * 20% ) / 42%
C ≈ 81.44%
Now that the Current Grade and Weight of the Final are calculated, the Final Exam Grade as well as the Min and Max possible grades are calculated in exactly the same way as in Option 1:
F = (D*WT - C*WC ) / WF = (80% * 100% - 81.44% * 42%) / 58%
F ≈ 78.96%
Min = C*WC / WT = 70% * 60% / 100% = 81.44% * 42% / 100% ≈ 34.20%
Max = Min + WF = 34.2% + 58% ≈ 92.20%
Bonus Part: Graph and Table of all Possible Course Grades
A bonus feature of our grade calculator is a table and graph showing all the possible course grades you can end up with as well as the associated final exam grades needed. The graph and table can be viewed after calculating your final exam grade. The calculations used in the table and chart are the exact same as the ones we just solved above but the desired grade is a variable that changes throughout the table.

What Is A Medicare Advantage Plan?
It’s Fall in Texas and up comes a commercial on the television, depicting seniors overly excited about their Medicare insurance plan benefits, jumping up and down eerily like they just won the lottery. Ever wonder what those ads are for? Chances are those ads are about Medicare Advantage plans (also known as Medicare Part C), which are offered by private insurance companies and approved by Medicare. Nearly 22 million Americans are on a Medicare Advantage plan currently. In a nutshell, they allow you to get all the coverage Original Medicare (Parts A and B) offers, plus additional benefits and services all in one single plan, such as prescription drug coverage (Part D), often for no additional premium. It is important to remember, that if you join a Medicare Advantage plan, you will still have Medicare. You just will get your coverage from your Medicare Advantage Plan, rather than Original Medicare.
How Do Medicare Advantage Plans Work Specifically?
When one joins a Medicare Advantage plan, let’s say here in Texas for instance, Medicare will pay a fixed amount each month to the insurance company and in return, the insurance companies must follow Medicare’s coverage rules (good thing). The Medicare Advantage plans also have yearly contracts with Medicare. Medicare Advantage plans can however charge different out-of-pocket costs and also have different rules for how one gets services (such as needing a referral to see a specialist). These rules can change each year. Your Medicare Advantage plan must notify you about any changes before the start of the next enrollment year, referred to as the “Annual Notice of Change” (ANOC) by September 30th. Case in point, Aetna Medicare in certain areas of Texas had changed plan numbers for a popular PPO plan late in 2019 and notified all those affected in writing ahead of time that they needed to enroll in the updated Aetna Medicare PPO plan or find a different insurance carrier.The most important thing to keep in mind is that if someone joins a Medicare Advantage plan, they will have the same rights and protections that you would have otherwise under Original Medicare.
I Heard Medicare Advantage Plans Include Extra Benefits, Is That True?
The answer is most likely yes, as benefits differ by plan and frankly by state. One plan offered in Texas may not have the same extra benefits as one in Florida or California but in general, many Medicare Advantage plans include prescription drug coverage, routine vision , hearing, and dental. Some also will include transportation benefits, telemedicine virtual visits so one can “visit” a doctor from the comfort of their home, a monthly allowance for over-the-counter items, and fitness memberships such as Silver Sneakers, that will give you complimentary access to local in-network facilities, such as Gold’s Gym in San Antonio, Texas for example. These extra’s are unique to Medicare Advantage plans, as Original Medicare will not cover them.
How Do I Become Eligible For Medicare Advantage Plans?
You’re eligible for a Medicare Advantage plan if you are enrolled in both Original Medicare Parts A and B, live in the plan’s service area, and you do not have end-stage renal disease (kidney failure). To learn how to acquire Medicare Parts A &B, visit our Medicare 101 page. An important note for 2021, is that folks that have ESRD will be able to get on a Medicare Advantage plan. Be sure to double-check that a plan is available in your local area, whether that is San Antonio, Texas, Pensacola, Florida, or even Los Angeles, California. On this note, unlike a Medicare Supplement, Medicare Advantage plans are not the same in every state, so if you move from let’s say Texas to California, you will have to re-enroll in a new Medicare Advantage plan in that area.
What Do Medicare Advantage Plans Cost?
Let’s start with the basics first. As you learned from our Medicare 101 page and from above, you must have both Medicare Part A&B to be on a Medicare Advantage plan. For many Americans, Part A is premium free because they worked at least 10 years (40 quarters) and payed Medicare taxes during that time and Part B is dependent on your adjusted gross income from 2 years prior, but typically is $148.50 a month in 2021. Many Americans deduct their Part B premiums from Social Security automatically but we do meet folks who delay their Social Security benefit, in which case they will pay their Part B premiums quarterly.
Medicare Advantage plans themselves may or may not have a premium, depending on the plan you choose. Typically, HMO’s will be premium-free, and PPO’s will have a premium but this depends on the specific Medicare Advantage plans in your area. You may also run into Medicare Advantage plans that could help pay for some or all of your Part B premium, referred to as a “Medicare Part B premium reduction”. Next, after analyzing Medicare Advantage premiums (if any), you will want to look internally at the policy, to see if you have a deductible (a set amount you pay before certain services are covered), copayment’s/coinsurance’s (a fixed amount or percentage you pay for services, such as $30 to see a primary care doctor), and look at what the annual out-of-pocket maximum is for your plan (the most someone could pay in a calendar year in copay’s/co-insurance’s, before the insurance company covers you 100%). As you learned from our Medicare 101 page, Original Medicare has some real let downs, notably no maximum out of pocket like Medicare Advantage plans have in every plan, typically from $3,400 -$6,700. Some important documents that you want to look at are the Summary of Benefits (SOB) which will give you a general outline of your plan, as well as the Evidence of Coverage (EOC), which goes more in-depth on what your plan will cover.
As you will learn below, if someone meets certain income requirements (Medicaid-level), they could potentially qualify to enroll in Medicare Advantage plans that are tailored to low-income Americans called Special Needs Plans (SNP’s). They could potentially not have any costs on a Medicare Advantage plan, such as copay’s/coinsurance’s.
What Are The Payment Stages If My Medicare Advantage Plan Has Drug Coverage Built Into The Plan?
Stage #1- Deducible Stage:
During this stage, if your plan has a deductible, you usually pay the full cost of your drugs up to the deductible amount. This in general, applies to drugs on tiers 3, 4, and 5. Once you reach the deductible amount, you pay a co-payment or co-insurance in the initial coverage stage.
Stage #2- Initial Coverage Stage:
During this stage, the plan pays its share of the cost and you pay a co-payment or co-insurance (your share of the cost) for each prescription you fill until your total drug costs reach $4,130. Once you reach $4,130, you enter the coverage gap or “donut hole”.
Stage #3- Coverage Gap Stage:
During this stage, you receive limited coverage on certain drugs. You’ll also get a discount on brand-name drugs and generic drugs. This stage continues until your yearly out-of-pocket drug costs reach $6,550. Once your yearly out-of-pocket costs reach $6,550, you move to catastrophic coverage.
Stage #4- Catastrophic Coverage Stage

------------question-----------------------
What does the writer reflect on during their trip to Utah and the shooting locations they visited
------------correct----------------------
aken within one hour, and you can see how the sky changed!
That afternoon and evening I got to hang out with my friend Michelle Olmstead. She is also very talented, and what's funny is we live only a half an hour away from each other and have never gotten together in Utah to go shoot.
We wanted to shoot sunset at the Snake River Overlook, but alas, there wasn't a cloud in the sky by the mountains, so the sunset was rather sub-par. I settled for some silhouette shots, trying to get those beautiful rays. Remember how I said to always look behind? Well, that evening when I looked behind me, it was gorgeous skies and clouds.
I also went down Mormon Row for a few barn shots in the late afternoon/early evening. It was spectacular!
Our last morning there, I woke up early again (yawn...) to go capture sunrise at Schwabacher's Landing. The iconic spot of the Tetons. It was gorgeous!
Well, it was a lovely trip! I can't wait to go back again and shoot there!

What characteristics of George Harrison’s songwriting are highlighted in the text segment
------------correct----------------------
the egos at play within the group that would eventually signal their demise.
- Top 10 Farewell Tours That Weren’t
- The Top 10 Best Pink Floyd Roger Waters Songs
- Is this a previously unreleased Nirvana song?
- Jeff Lynne’s ELO to play Wembley Stadium
5. Within You Without You (1967)
Once more, into the mystic. This Indian-influenced, sitar-led swirl demonstrated Harrison’s growing love for an alternative culture. While other fellow travellers such as Donavon flirted with the sitar, it was Harrison who placed it most successfully in the pop/rock idiom. This Sgt Pepper track is a prime example.
4. Taxman (1966)
Surprisingly, it was Macca who supplied the strident guitar solo of this vibrant opener to the Revolver album. Harrison meanwhile, offered a wry observation of the British tax system – ‘’and you’re working for nobody but me’’. Listen carefully for namechecks for those political buffoons of the day messrs’ Wilson and Heath.
3. Here Comes The Sun (1969)
Written in Eric Clapton’s garden when Harrison sagged off from attending meetings at their Apple HQ, his increasing frustration of life as a fab one flowered into a truly uplifting composition. He added some subtle moog synth effects to a song that is always guaranteed to brighten up the bleakest of days.
2. Something (1969)
Built around the phrase ‘’Something in the way she moves’’ (borrowed from a song by Apple Records artist James Taylor), Harrison’s own maturing songwriting talent created one of the Beatles’ most-covered songs, with Frank Sinatra proclaiming it to be ‘’the greatest love song of the last 50 years’’. In late 1969 it was extracted from the Abbey Road album to become a worldwide hit.
1. While My Guitar Gently Weeps (1968)
This White Album epic started life as a gentle acoustic piece. In rocking it up, he called upon the services of the then Cream member Eric Clapton. Their duel guitar battle is a truly thrilling coda and has ensured that this song remains at the forefront of his considerable Beatle achievements.

What were the main focuses of the protests in Kiev that began in response to government actions towards the European Union
------------correct----------------------
For months though the harsh winter, tens of thousands of citizens took to the center of the capital to protest their government backing out from completing a years long negotiation with the European Union.
What started as a limited protest in the main square of the nation's capital Kiev last fall changed into an entirely different protest with the abuse of peaceful protesters turning the entire saga where it is today into one squarely focused on two major issues: human rights and corruption.
This pulled directly at Da Horsey's heartstrings and this video of a Ukrainian woman from Kiev went viral on YouTube as she asked for international support in their cause seeking freedom against selfish politicians calling them barbarians.
Later her foreshadowing of violence against the people would prove prescient but what wasn't is the fast paced outcome of events overthrowing the president within days of an interim agreement.
The people wouldn't accept a president remaining in office, even on an interim basis who had set loose armed snipers killing dozens in the center of the capital.
To this point, they have won - standing on their own and sacrificing their bodies and lives against a cynical foe.
In her words...

What actions are the members of the government and citizens of Ukraine seeking in response to corruption and crimes against humanity
------------correct----------------------
ee from a dictatorship. We want to be free from the politicians who work only for themselves... just for saving their power... We are civilized people but our government are barbarians.. We want our courts not to be corrupted. We want to be free."
The former president, who within 48 hours went from colluding with state security forces placing snipers around the Maidan where tens of thousands refused to be intimidated from all over the country seeing dozens upon dozens among them killed and hundreds more wounded now has a warrant out for his arrest for his crimes against humanity.
The reforming government in Ukraine is seeking an international court to try the case.
MSV was present in 2004 in the Maidan during the Orange Revolution and saw the spirit of freedom first hand.
It left an indelible mark and appreciation for our freedoms here. Those freedoms must be actively defended.
A convenient little conspiracy has existed for more than a year attempting to destroy voices who have spoken out against corruption and its major underwriter.
Do you think that's where it ends? It didn't fare so well for another "untouchable" did it?

The former BJP MP and party rebel from Kullu Mr. Mehashwer Singh stated that his relation with the Congress MLA and his younger minister brother Mr. Karan Singh was just misunderstood. “I have skipped the oath taking ceremony of his younger brother because he was not invited for the searing ceremony formally.”
During three and half years of Congress government, Mr. Singh had cordial relation with Mr. Virbhadra Singh however, it was suddenly deteriorated with induction of Mr. Karan Singh in the state cabinet. Now the subsequent development followed by the takeover of Raghunath temple from the family trust of Mr. Singh by the state Congress rule reveals that relation between the HLP Leader and 6 time chief minister Mr. Virbhadra Singh is no more cordial.
The cabinet decisions of takeover has been taken at the time of virtual overture of royal scion of Kullu into BJP or form third front against the Congress regime with Aam Aadmi Party and other third forces in the state.

------------question-----------------------
Why is the Winnipeg School Division considering adding an International Baccalaureate program in French
------------correct----------------------
Winnipeg’s largest school division will consider adding an International Baccalaureate program in French to keep students from leaving their studies in French immersion.
Officials with the Winnipeg School Division say they will study the feasibility of offering the enriched university entrance-focused program, in light of division numbers that show the number of students in French immersion begins to drop as they approach high school.
One theory is that students are signing up for an IB or advanced-placement program instead, which are only offered in English. In kindergarten to Grade 12 French immersion programs, the majority of instruction is done in French.
“We know that the numbers are dropping. We just want to take a little bit deeper [look] into ‘why does that happen?'” said WSD trustee Jamie Dumont, who adds there are likely a number of reasons behind the drop-off in French immersion enrolment.
Numbers showing the decline were previously shared with trustees at a closed-door meeting. CBC asked for those numbers, but the division did not reproduce the statistics on Friday.
Despite the drop in numbers as students approach high school, overall enrolment in French immersion in the division has increased significantly in the past decade.
The number of French immersion students went from 3,353 in 2008-09 to 4,717 in September 2018, the division says.

) Plans-PPO plans use a network of providers but you are able to go outside the network to seek care, usually at higher cost-sharing, such as 50% co-insurance. You can also see a specialist, without needing a referral from your primary care doctor. You may also be able to utilize specialty facilities like M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, if they are willing to bill out-of-network with your PPO plan. In most cases, prescription drugs are covered in Medicare PPO plans. If you find out you don’t have drug coverage with your plan, you cannot join a stand-alone prescription drug plan (Part D).
Special Needs Plans (SNP’s)-These plans provide benefits and services to people with specific diseases, certain health care needs (like Diabetes), or limited incomes (such as on Medicaid). SNP’s cover the same services that all Medicare Advantage plans cover, but you will have to continuously meet the special conditions to stay on this type of plan. For example, if I am on a Medicare Advantage SEP Dual plan (low income), and I lose Medicaid, this could result in me having to go back to a regular Medicare Advantage plan. With these types of plans, you generally must get care from providers in the network, but some SNP’s may be PPO plans that allow you to go out-of-network. There will be a strong emphasis on managed care with these plans, so referrals will most likely be needed to see a specialist. All SNP’s must provide prescription drug coverage.
Private Fee-For-Service (PFFS) Plans- This kind of Medicare Advantage plan allows you to go to any Medicare-approved provider that accepts the plan’s payment terms and will agree to treat you. If your PFFS plan has a network, these providers have already agreed to the plan’s terms. You will not need a referral to see a specialist with this type of plan. Keep in mind that in a medical emergency, the nearest provider must treat you. In most cases, prescription drugs are covered in Medicare PPFS plans. If you find out you don’t have drug coverage with your plan, you cannot join a stand-alone prescription drug plan (Part D).
Medical Savings Account (MSA) Plans-MSA plans combine a high-deductible insurance plan with a medical savings account that you can use to pay for your health care costs. Besides the Part A&B services that MSA plans must cover, some plans may offer additional benefits like dental coverage for an extra cost. With an MSA plan, you can choose your health care providers. You will need to get a separate stand-alone prescription drug plan (Part D) with this plan option.
When Can I Sign Up For A Medicare Advantage Plan?
You can sign up for a Medicare Advantage plan during the enrollment periods below:
Initial Enrollment Period-When you first become eligible for Medicare, you can sign up during what is referred to as the Initial Enrollment Period (IEP). This 7-month period begins 3 months before you turn 65, the month of your 65th birthday, and ends 3 months after you turn 65. This period is crucial, because you have to make a decision on how you want to receive your Medicare benefits (ie. Medicare Advantage or Medicare Supplement). So when does coverage start? Well it depends on when you enroll. If you sign up during the first 3 months of your IEP, in most cases, your coverage starts the first day of your birthday month. So if I enroll on March 24th and my birthday month is April, my Medicare Advantage plan would start April 1st. If you enrolled after the initial 3 months, your start date for coverage will be delayed. After enrolling during your IEP, any plan changes can only be made at certain times of the year, as you’ll learn below.
Annual Enrollment Period-Remember when we talked earlier about those commercials on television, depicting seniors overly excited about their Medicare plan benefits? Well, this is the time of the year when seniors will be bombarded with such ads on television, in the mail, online, and on the phone. Because October 15th- December 7th, anyone who has Medicare can join, switch, or drop a Medicare Advantage plan. Coverage will begin on January 1st, so long as you enrolled before the end of December 7th. We caution you to be wary of all the noise you will hear during this time, and to analyze if your Medicare Advantage plan is still working out for you. It never hurts to see what is out there, but be sure to check that all your doctors, medications, and so forth are covered, despite what the fast-talking agent says! Often here in San Antonio, Texas and beyond, we hear horror stories of dishonest agents who were careless in their assistance with seniors, and put them on plans that were less than ideal for them, or suddenly become “unreachable” after they get the sale. Be careful!
Open Enrollment Period- This period allows you to switch from one Medicare Advantage plan to another (with or without drug coverage), disenroll from a Medicare Advantage plan and go back to Original Medicare. If you choose to do so, you can then join a Medicare prescription drug plan. You cannot however, go from Original Medicare to a Medicare Advantage plan/Medicare prescription drug plan, or switch from one Medicare prescription drug plan to another. This period runs from January 1st through March 31st each year. You can only make one change during this period, and any changes made will be effective the first of the month after the insurance company gets your request. If you are having second-thoughts about a Medicare Advantage plan you choose during AEP, this would be a great opportunity to try out a new plan without having to wait a long time.
Special Enrollment Period- In certain situations, you may be able to join, switch, or drop a Medicare Advantage plan during this period. You must qualify due to certain reasons, such as having both Medicare and Medicaid, receiving “Extra Help” from the government with your Part D drugs, changing where you live and having to enroll in a different Medicare Advantage plan such as from Texas to California, leaving employer coverage, etc. It is vital to pay close attention to deadlines you have during this enrollment period. For instance, you have a 2-month window after your work coverage ends, to acquire a Medicare Advantage plan. If someone is on a SNP plan (remember above) that is tailored for folks on Medicare/Medicaid, they can change to another SNP plan one time during these periods: January-March, April-June, July-September.
Do I Need To Enroll Each Year?
This is a question we get asked often here in San Antonio, Texas, and the short answer is that your plan automatically renews each year as long as you pay the premium and the plan is available in your service area. You do not have to do anything to your coverage, but make sure that the plan is meeting your ongoing needs.
What Are Star Ratings And Why Do They Matter?
Star ratings are a way for consumers to compare the relative quality of care of Medicare Advantage plans. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issues the ratings based on:
- Administrative Results
- Clinical Outcomes
- Plan Member Surveys
Every Medicare Advantage plan receives star ratings from one star (lowest) to five stars (highest). CMS also issues an overall star rating for each plan. This matters because if you run into a plan with a low star rating, you might want to research why! This system also matters on the opposite spectrum, because if you run into a 5-star Medicare Advantage plan in your area, such as in San Antonio, Texas, this creates a Special Enrollment Period in its own right, as between December 8th and November 30th, you can enroll in a 5-star plan, one time.
Do Agents/Brokers Get Paid To Enroll Me On A Medicare Advantage Plan?
Yes. We are real straight-forward folks here at The Harrin Group and want to give you a behind-the-scenes look at compensation. Basically, an agent or broker gets compensated from the insurance company he/she is representing, for every new Medicare Advantage plan enrollment. While we won’t go into exa

------------question-----------------------
What are the main reasons for filmmakers preferring digital film over traditional 70mm film in today's market
------------correct----------------------
sed to shoot with that type of film. Today, there are limited resources in terms of projectors that can play 70mm film, let alone projectionists trained to expertly show these types of films on a regular basis.
Essentially, 35mm film did to 70mm film what digital film is currently doing to 35mm film… making it obsolete. 35mm film was more manipulable for different formats, and could be squeezed and bent more easily without distortion, unlike 70mm film.
The Digital Revolution
Traditional motion pictures are recorded on analog film frames, whereas digital film is recorded as digital video images. That is a fundamental difference that creates a very different visual experience for movie-goers who prefer “the real thing”. Digital film is captured like a digital photograph, using light sensors and digital receptors to resolve the image, but that’s only the very basic version.
High-definition video (Hi-def) has even better resolution, and this has since been followed up by 2K and 4K, creating an arms race to create the most incredibly clear and detailed movies on the market. Digital film is useful and preferred in many instances because it can be crunched down to whatever size is most convenient, without losing much resolution. For example, a new movie that is shot on digital film, rather than celluloid film, can be manipulated and shrunk to fit on the screen of a tablet or smartphone without compromising picture quality.
In a mobile, device-oriented society, this flexible capability makes it more profitable and sensible for most directors to shoot films in a digital format. Even most old movies have been re-recorded in digital formats for that same reason – ease of distribution and consumption.
One might think that with our ever-advancing digital technology, the resolution would be far better in a high-definition digital film, making the discussion of 70mm vs. digital superfluous. However, high-format celluloid films (70mm) have relatively comparable, if not better, resolution than high-definition digital films. There is also an authentic edge to old-school cinematography, which is often lost in the glossy, sterile, and polished appearance of digital projection.
While neither of these two formats can be called “better” than the other, the decision of whether to support or see a digital film vs. a 70mm film truly comes down to personal preference. For traditional film lovers, a movie shot in 70mm will always be superior to the plasticized images of a digital film, whereas superhero blockbuster fans are almost certainly digital film supporters, considering those CGI effects and epic battle scenes would likely be impossible without digital magic!

In the dye room this morning we reground the fourth and final exhaust dyestuff for the Turkey Red samples and heated it to temperature so that it could cool before dyeing tomorrow. Debbie has hung the Turkey Red-prepared cloth in the college smoking shelter – which might well discourage smokers from entering and be very good for overall Welsh health.
Many madder recipes state that one should not raise the temperature of the dyepot above a certain point or the colours will turn brown. On the other hand, many recipes have silk or wool boiling for as much as an hour. So what’s going on?
Jill Goodwin advises a maximum of 158 F (70 C). We were careful to follow her recipe yesterday, but today someone suggested we should boil one of the Goodwin skeins to see if it would affect the colour.
So we did, and it didn’t…. and it set us thinking where such advice originates and under what, if any, circumstances it might be true.
Our visit to the museum was interesting but short and there were far too many of us for a comfortable visit. Nevertheless, I enjoyed watching the spinning mule in action, and touring the finishing and weaving sheds. Across in the field was a tenterframe for stretching and finishing cloth, and a windhouse for drying more delicate fabric. The tenterframe looked squeaky-new and unhistoric (do Ikea offer a selection?) but gave some idea of how the field might once have looked.
I came across a set of natural-dyed yarns produced by David and Margaret Redpath who, until 2002, ran Wallis Mill i

environment for the youth organization. U. Shahan described the lifelong friendships that the AYF fostered along with the organization’s struggle during the times of a non-free and independent Armenia. U. Nairi explained how far the organization has come and how the AYF has affected each of the lives of its members so deeply. After the keynote speakers, U. George Aghjayan gave remarks on behalf of the AYF’s parent organization, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation.
Once the remarks concluded, the dance portion of the night kicked off. As coffee and dessert were served, a band filled with AYF alumni of different generations got the crowd out of their seats and onto the dance floor. Active and former AYF members alike joined in to dance traditional Armenian line dances. At one point the legendary John Berberian took the stage to perform a guest appearance on the oud. As the dancefloor roared on, attendees continued reminiscing and taking pictures, creating new AYF memories and strengthening old ones. Once the dance ended, an after party was held at a nearby bar where attendees could get in one last drink and bite to eat together before calling it a night.
All in all, the AYF 85th Anniversary Gala was a smashing success. Past, present, and future members old and young gathered to celebrate the organization that has had such an effect on their lives. The spirit of the AYF was palpable throughout the event and the organization’s outlook looks bright. Here’s to another 85 years of the AYF-YOARF!

What highlights were featured during the AYF's 85th Anniversary Gala
------------correct----------------------
AYF’s 85th Anniversary Gala Filled with Memories and Fun
For 85 years, the Armenian Youth Federation has been an organization of family, traditions and growth. On Saturday, July 21, 2018 that growth was celebrated by the very families who created those traditions. The AYF-YOARF’s 85th Anniversary Gala brought multiple generations of AYF lifers together in Warwick, Rhode Island for a night of nostalgia, outlook, and a good old fashioned AYF barehantes.
The night began with a cocktail hour. Upon arrival, guests reconnected with old friends and discussed their time in the AYF over drinks and mezze. At the front of the cocktail hour area stood a table curated with AYF memorabilia from years past. Guests flipped through previous Olympic ad books, looked at printed pictures from events past, and read from old AYF song books. On one of the back walls played a slideshow of pictures which hundreds of members submitted of their fondest AYF memories. Along each of the back walls hung informational posters detailing AYF chapters past and present. A step and repeat with the AYF logo and an image of Karekin Nejdeh (the organization’s founder) was the perfect place to capture a group shot of another great AYF event.
After the cocktail hour came dinner and the program, emceed by U. Josh Tevekelian. U. Josh described his experiences within the organization and the lessons it has taught him that have stuck with him to this day. He then introduced the night’s keynote speakers, U. Rosemary Alashaian, U. Shahan Avedian, and U. Nairi Khachatourian. Each speaker represented a different AYF generation in the room. U. Rosemary spoke of her days in the AYF during its relative infancy and creating a family

environment for the youth organization. U. Shahan described the lifelong friendships that the AYF fostered along with the organization’s struggle during the times of a non-free and independent Armenia. U. Nairi explained how far the organization has come and how the AYF has affected each of the lives of its members so deeply. After the keynote speakers, U. George Aghjayan gave remarks on behalf of the AYF’s parent organization, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation.
Once the remarks concluded, the dance portion of the night kicked off. As coffee and dessert were served, a band filled with AYF alumni of different generations got the crowd out of their seats and onto the dance floor. Active and former AYF members alike joined in to dance traditional Armenian line dances. At one point the legendary John Berberian took the stage to perform a guest appearance on the oud. As the dancefloor roared on, attendees continued reminiscing and taking pictures, creating new AYF memories and strengthening old ones. Once the dance ended, an after party was held at a nearby bar where attendees could get in one last drink and bite to eat together before calling it a night.
All in all, the AYF 85th Anniversary Gala was a smashing success. Past, present, and future members old and young gathered to celebrate the organization that has had such an effect on their lives. The spirit of the AYF was palpable throughout the event and the organization’s outlook looks bright. Here’s to another 85 years of the AYF-YOARF!

Join us on November 28th, 2018 at 1:00 pm CST for a 30 minute webinar where Precision Software's Olivier Joncas will discuss FTA compliance and perform a live demonstration of our FTA software solution. To register, please click here.
Why Should You Attend?
FTA compliance offers a clear commercial advantage — preferential duties. When goods qualify for preferential treatment, duties are reduced or eliminated. If you can sell or import products with zero tariffs, you can reduce cost and maximize profit.
But It’s Too Complicated!
Free trade agreement compliance can be complicated and time-consuming. Here’s a quick rundown. Preferential rules of origin are used to determine origin of goods under an FTA. These rules of origin use criteria like tariff shift, regional value content, de minimis and so forth. To qualify their goods, manufacturers must pull production bills of material (BOMs) and perform content calculations. If their goods qualify, they must prepare and disseminate FTA certificates of origin. They may also need to reassess their products multiple times during the year. Changes to legislation, costs, BOMs or suppliers can impact whether or not a finished product qualifies under an FTA.
Doing all of this manually is certainly a challenge. That is why most organizations don’t bother. Only 30 percent of multinationals take advantage of all the FTAs that they could. Think about that — 70 percent of multinationals are ignoring a competitive advantage.
Free trade agreements are not static. To give you an example, here are some FTA news stories, all from this week.
The WTO recognizes more than 450 FTAs. For a multinational working across the globe, keeping up with all FTA legislation and remaining compliant can seem too much like hard work.
There is An Easier Way
Yes, FTA compliance can be complicated. But it doesn’t have to be. It is possible to automate the most complex and time-consuming aspects of FTA compliance. Join us on November 28th, 2018 at 1:00 pm CST for a 30 minute webinar. Olivier Joncas

Panel: Check Instead: the Colonial Matrix of Power!*
The panel discussion will deal with following issues:
What are the (violent) cultural/artistic interventions in spaces outside of the First Capitalist World that are taking place in the present? What is the logic behind interventions of private financial institutions in artistic and cultural space of so-called Southeastern Europe? What is their relation to public institutions? How can we understand these interventions within the framework of re-awakened Austrian imperialist aspirations? How are interventions by actors other than governments and private financial institutions (for example artists, curators) connected to coloniality and western exceptionalism? How would an artistic intervention which de-links from the global capitalist understanding of intervention look like? What are or would be counter-strategies?

Check Instead: the Colonial Matrix of Power!* is a collaborative project by Branko Andrić, Sheri Avraham, Iris Borovčnik, Lina Dokuzović, Christian Gangl, Miltiadis Gerothanasis, Ana Hoffner, Tatiana Kai-Browne, Baris Kiziltoprak, Marissa Lobo, Nataša Mackuljak, Ivana Marjanović, Maria Muhar, Marion Oberhofer, Ervin Tahirović, Majda Turkić, Reinhard Uttenthaler
The project consists of the workshop that took place in November and December 2009 in VBKÖ, an exhibition in the VBKÖ in December 2009, upcoming panel discussion within the 100 YEARS – VBKÖ program and presentation of the project within the Rundgang, Academy of Fine Arts Vienna. The project is part of Squatting Teachers initiative within the context of the university protests. It is organized by Ana Hoffner and Ivana Marjanovic and supported by the Post Conceptual Art Practices Class, Academy of Fine Arts Vienna.
The notion of representation in the history of exhibition production in Western Europe has often been based on sexist and racist stereotypes and is directly related to the coloniality of power. With the changes in Europe and globally over the last few decades (such as EU integration), new tendencies in the mode o

What temperature does Jill Goodwin recommend as a maximum for dyeing, and what experiment did the speakers conduct with one of her skeins
------------correct----------------------
In the dye room this morning we reground the fourth and final exhaust dyestuff for the Turkey Red samples and heated it to temperature so that it could cool before dyeing tomorrow. Debbie has hung the Turkey Red-prepared cloth in the college smoking shelter – which might well discourage smokers from entering and be very good for overall Welsh health.
Many madder recipes state that one should not raise the temperature of the dyepot above a certain point or the colours will turn brown. On the other hand, many recipes have silk or wool boiling for as much as an hour. So what’s going on?
Jill Goodwin advises a maximum of 158 F (70 C). We were careful to follow her recipe yesterday, but today someone suggested we should boil one of the Goodwin skeins to see if it would affect the colour.
So we did, and it didn’t…. and it set us thinking where such advice originates and under what, if any, circumstances it might be true.
Our visit to the museum was interesting but short and there were far too many of us for a comfortable visit. Nevertheless, I enjoyed watching the spinning mule in action, and touring the finishing and weaving sheds. Across in the field was a tenterframe for stretching and finishing cloth, and a windhouse for drying more delicate fabric. The tenterframe looked squeaky-new and unhistoric (do Ikea offer a selection?) but gave some idea of how the field might once have looked.
I came across a set of natural-dyed yarns produced by David and Margaret Redpath who, until 2002, ran Wallis Mill i

What advantages does 70mm film have compared to 35mm film
------------correct----------------------
Listen to this post
The battle between old-school nostalgia and modern gadgetry has been raging for centuries, but it seems to have reached a fever pitch in recent decades, given our rapid improvements in technology, increase in consumer demand, and cultural divides between old and new. Vinyl or MP3? Satellite or cable? Books or Kindles? Batman or Superman?
This struggle between modernity and tradition is particularly obvious in the world of film, where aging film buffs and modern indie film fans frequently duke it out over which type of film is better – 35 mm, 24mm, 70mm, IMAX, digital…?
With the recent resurgence of throwback film techniques (most notably, Quentin Tarantino’s use of 70mm film to shoot his 2015 western thriller The Hateful Eight – see the clip above), a whole new generation of people are being exposed to some nearly forgotten film styles, and an ancient debate is heating up once again.
What is 70mm Film?
As the advertisements for Tarantino’s latest film proudly proclaimed, the movie would be available for viewing in “Glorious 70mm – Ultra Panavision 70”, and most people had no idea what they meant. Well, 70mm is just another variety of analogue film, more specifically, a film reel with frames that are 70mm in width. The gauge for most motion pictures is 35mm, and while most movies are still wonderful to watch, the difference when you jump to a 70mm gauge is quite noticeable.
The resolution of 70mm film is much better than 35mm, providing a richer visual experience and extremely detailed images that are a joy to watch. This type of film also changes the aspect ratio of the film, stretching it to a wider 2.2:1 ratio, rather than the typical 1.35:1 (known as the Academy ratio) or 16:9 (widescreen ratio). This makes 70mm films ideal for larger and wider screens (for example, IMAX films shoot on a special type of 70mm film).
Now, it’s important to remember that Tarantino is far from the first person to use 70mm film for a movie; in fact, the technology dates back to the very beginning of cinema. Throughout film history, when a director wanted to shoot an epic film, such as Ben-Hur or Lawrence of Arabia, they would choose to shoot on 70mm film. This was perfect for the Panavision movie palaces that featured extremely wide screens and could accommodate the wider image of these early “blockbusters”. However, as the decades passed, movie theaters evolved (and shrank), the popularity of the lighter and less expensive 35mm film grew, and 70mm film fell from popularity, despite its undeniably better quality.
The equipment to transport, store, and play 70mm film was expensive, bulky, and difficult to manipulate, as were the cameras u

f representation have appeared. Forces are put together not only to investigate what the creativity of the “developing Other” is about, but also what the “developing Other’s” emancipation is about, or better yet, where the developing Other is now on the scale of the implementation of neo-liberal values.
In 2009 numerous exhibitions have been staged, artworks produced and symposia organized, as Europe was in the euphoria of celebrating the triumph of capitalism: the anniversary of twenty years of the fall of the Berlin Wall. One such project is the Gender Check exhibition, investigating femininity and masculinity in Eastern European art since the 1960s, initiated by the Erste Foundation at the MUMOK.
Our intervention takes such projects as a point of departure for a critical reflection of the ongoing Western investigation and control of democratic values and social emancipation in countries that recently joined, and those which are about to join the EU (as well as in other regions). Exhibiting role models of femininity and masculinity in Eastern Europe follows a strict logic of identity politics as they make it possible to identify, fragmentize, categorize and make the Other visible, and therefore, controllable.
Parallel to that investigation and control of political values, state-legitimized racism and patriarchal models of exclusion in Western countries are perpetually reproduced. Both practices, inside and outside of Western imperial centers, follow the same logic of strengthening former colonial powers through systematic exploitation and marginalization. We can find a continuity of colonial practices in the way that the “Eastern” and “Southern” worlds are perceived as uncivilized, underdeveloped and barbaric and how migrants are constantly supervised, accused and criminalized in Western countries themselves. These institutionalized racist processes, in addition to the constructed exceptionality of Western Europe as progressive and emancipated, are never checked.

y across the square from the entrance to the massive Union Station, home to trains and subway lines.
Between subway lines, street cars and good shoes, we saw many other great sights.
The hotel is also in walking distance of Bay Street and the business district, as well as fine examples of older architecture.
Most will wait for another post, but here’s a preview at some particularly striking properties – in the Annex, on our way to the St. Lawrence Market, and at the University of Toronto.
Be prepared to be impressed with this property’s showers. As was the case when I stayed with this brand in Québec City, the oversized rain shower is exposed to the general living area – but you have the option of capturing privacy with wooden blinds on the shower’s outer walls.
I love Molton Brown toiletries, and we both appreciated the his-and-hers closets and ample storage.
Style and Great Little Touches
The brand also offers some of the healthier Continental breakfasts you might find on offer and, yes, those are three rows of apples adjacent to our elevator. We appreciated stellar service from Karyl at breakfast both mornings, and Concierge Tatiana was very helpful with directions and suggestions.
I find Le Germain to be big on little touches. Turndown service includes water and boxed chocolates, and there are urns in the hallways for those who would like to top up their carafes. We’re off to the Big Apple next, but are already looking forward to returning to this property.

What Is A Medicare Advantage Plan?
It’s Fall in Texas and up comes a commercial on the television, depicting seniors overly excited about their Medicare insurance plan benefits, jumping up and down eerily like they just won the lottery. Ever wonder what those ads are for? Chances are those ads are about Medicare Advantage plans (also known as Medicare Part C), which are offered by private insurance companies and approved by Medicare. Nearly 22 million Americans are on a Medicare Advantage plan currently. In a nutshell, they allow you to get all the coverage Original Medicare (Parts A and B) offers, plus additional benefits and services all in one single plan, such as prescription drug coverage (Part D), often for no additional premium. It is important to remember, that if you join a Medicare Advantage plan, you will still have Medicare. You just will get your coverage from your Medicare Advantage Plan, rather than Original Medicare.
How Do Medicare Advantage Plans Work Specifically?
When one joins a Medicare Advantage plan, let’s say here in Texas for instance, Medicare will pay a fixed amount each month to the insurance company and in return, the insurance companies must follow Medicare’s coverage rules (good thing). The Medicare Advantage plans also have yearly contracts with Medicare. Medicare Advantage plans can however charge different out-of-pocket costs and also have different rules for how one gets services (such as needing a referral to see a specialist). These rules can change each year. Your Medicare Advantage plan must notify you about any changes before the start of the next enrollment year, referred to as the “Annual Notice of Change” (ANOC) by September 30th. Case in point, Aetna Medicare in certain areas of Texas had changed plan numbers for a popular PPO plan late in 2019 and notified all those affected in writing ahead of time that they needed to enroll in the updated Aetna Medicare PPO plan or find a different insurance carrier.The most important thing to keep in mind is that if someone joins a Medicare Advantage plan, they will have the same rights and protections that you would have otherwise under Original Medicare.
I Heard Medicare Advantage Plans Include Extra Benefits, Is That True?
The answer is most likely yes, as benefits differ by plan and frankly by state. One plan offered in Texas may not have the same extra benefits as one in Florida or California but in general, many Medicare Advantage plans include prescription drug coverage, routine vision , hearing, and dental. Some also will include transportation benefits, telemedicine virtual visits so one can “visit” a doctor from the comfort of their home, a monthly allowance for over-the-counter items, and fitness memberships such as Silver Sneakers, that will give you complimentary access to local in-network facilities, such as Gold’s Gym in San Antonio, Texas for example. These extra’s are unique to Medicare Advantage plans, as Original Medicare will not cover them.
How Do I Become Eligible For Medicare Advantage Plans?
You’re eligible for a Medicare Advantage plan if you are enrolled in both Original Medicare Parts A and B, live in the plan’s service area, and you do not have end-stage renal disease (kidney failure). To learn how to acquire Medicare Parts A &B, visit our Medicare 101 page. An important note for 2021, is that folks that have ESRD will be able to get on a Medicare Advantage plan. Be sure to double-check that a plan is available in your local area, whether that is San Antonio, Texas, Pensacola, Florida, or even Los Angeles, California. On this note, unlike a Medicare Supplement, Medicare Advantage plans are not the same in every state, so if you move from let’s say Texas to California, you will have to re-enroll in a new Medicare Advantage plan in that area.
What Do Medicare Advantage Plans Cost?
Let’s start with the basics first. As you learned from our Medicare 101 page and from above, you must have both Medicare Part A&B to be on a Medicare Advantage plan. For many Americans, Part A is premium free because they worked at least 10 years (40 quarters) and payed Medicare taxes during that time and Part B is dependent on your adjusted gross income from 2 years prior, but typically is $148.50 a month in 2021. Many Americans deduct their Part B premiums from Social Security automatically but we do meet folks who delay their Social Security benefit, in which case they will pay their Part B premiums quarterly.
Medicare Advantage plans themselves may or may not have a premium, depending on the plan you choose. Typically, HMO’s will be premium-free, and PPO’s will have a premium but this depends on the specific Medicare Advantage plans in your area. You may also run into Medicare Advantage plans that could help pay for some or all of your Part B premium, referred to as a “Medicare Part B premium reduction”. Next, after analyzing Medicare Advantage premiums (if any), you will want to look internally at the policy, to see if you have a deductible (a set amount you pay before certain services are covered), copayment’s/coinsurance’s (a fixed amount or percentage you pay for services, such as $30 to see a primary care doctor), and look at what the annual out-of-pocket maximum is for your plan (the most someone could pay in a calendar year in copay’s/co-insurance’s, before the insurance company covers you 100%). As you learned from our Medicare 101 page, Original Medicare has some real let downs, notably no maximum out of pocket like Medicare Advantage plans have in every plan, typically from $3,400 -$6,700. Some important documents that you want to look at are the Summary of Benefits (SOB) which will give you a general outline of your plan, as well as the Evidence of Coverage (EOC), which goes more in-depth on what your plan will cover.
As you will learn below, if someone meets certain income requirements (Medicaid-level), they could potentially qualify to enroll in Medicare Advantage plans that are tailored to low-income Americans called Special Needs Plans (SNP’s). They could potentially not have any costs on a Medicare Advantage plan, such as copay’s/coinsurance’s.
What Are The Payment Stages If My Medicare Advantage Plan Has Drug Coverage Built Into The Plan?
Stage #1- Deducible Stage:
During this stage, if your plan has a deductible, you usually pay the full cost of your drugs up to the deductible amount. This in general, applies to drugs on tiers 3, 4, and 5. Once you reach the deductible amount, you pay a co-payment or co-insurance in the initial coverage stage.
Stage #2- Initial Coverage Stage:
During this stage, the plan pays its share of the cost and you pay a co-payment or co-insurance (your share of the cost) for each prescription you fill until your total drug costs reach $4,130. Once you reach $4,130, you enter the coverage gap or “donut hole”.
Stage #3- Coverage Gap Stage:
During this stage, you receive limited coverage on certain drugs. You’ll also get a discount on brand-name drugs and generic drugs. This stage continues until your yearly out-of-pocket drug costs reach $6,550. Once your yearly out-of-pocket costs reach $6,550, you move to catastrophic coverage.
Stage #4- Catastrophic Coverage Stage

During this stage, you receive limited coverage on certain drugs. You’ll also get a discount on brand-name drugs and generic drugs. This stage continues until your yearly out-of-pocket drug costs reach $6,550. Once your yearly out-of-pocket costs reach $6,550, you move to catastrophic coverage.
Stage #4- Catastrophic Coverage Stage

What new features are included in the Kolab 2.3.0 server
------------correct----------------------
“For the plane in the fog, the mountain is unforeseeable, but then it is suddenly very real, and inevitable.”
Simon Forster, Minister for foreign relations
WHAT IS KOLAB?
Kolab is a personal information management solution, also referred to as groupware. It can provide and manage your information including email, address books, calendars and tasks.
The Kolab server acts as the central information repository and thanks to its uniquely powerful design can host up to tens of thousands, theoretically even hundreds of thousands of users.
All these users can freely share email, address books, calendars and/or tasks with all, some, or none of the other users. This allows Kolab to provide the support base for a wide variety of activities, such as coordinating appointments, working on common projects and ensuring consistency in customer contact.
The new Kolab 2.3.0 server includes a lot of new features, namely:
- Z-push synchronization for mobile devices
- A reworked webadmin
- The possibility to have multiple accounts with the same name.
- Modular packaging of the webclient
- Many updated core components
- Tons of bug fixes
A detailed list of changes is available here
Because of the changes in LDAP, upgrading from 2.2.4 is not trivial and requires manual intervention. Please make sure you read and follow the upgrade instructions in http://files.kolab.org/server/release/kolab-server-2.3.0/sources/1st.README
Documentation and OpenPKG packages are available from here as shown on http://kolab.org/download.html.
Binary packages for Debian GNU/Linux 6.0 (Squeeze/stable) and 5.0 (Lenny/oldstable) on x86 platforms can be found next to the sources.

Tour at Lake Lucerne
In the morning the welcome briefing and the bike distribution take place. This tour leads over some smooth hill next to the lake from where you have wonderful views on Lake Lucerne and the famous mountain pasture Rigi. Green meadows and calm streets make the city seem very far away.
After some kilometres you reach Küssnacht with its lake promenade and continue to Weggis where the ship brings you to the other side of the lake. From here you cycle to the peninsula Horw, from where it is easy to cycle back to the city.
From the town centre of Lucerne you go through a small village called Emmenbrücke and up to a small quiet hill, where you find many beautiful farm houses.
There are some ups and downs in this part but you have a lovely view on the close mountain panorama. After some time you reach the monastery Werthenstein und from here you roll smoothly back to Lucerne.
Today’s goal is the picturesque town Sursee situated on the shore of Lake Sempach. You cycle past small villages on calm streets and past farms and meadows until you reach the lake.
Sursee is a perfect spot for a lunch break. Take your time to walk through the lovely town centre and try some Swiss specialities. The way back leads on the shore of the lake.
Visit Lake Zug
The first part of this route is already known from the first days tour. As soon as you reach Küssnacht you make your way to Lake Zug and go on a boat tour to the city of Zug. From here you cycle along the shore until you reach a quiet path back to

It is interesting to note that former Chief Minister and leader of Opposition Mr. Prem Kumar Dhumal had bitter relation with Mr. Singh who may oppose his u-turn in the party. Other camp of Lead by Former Union Minister Mr. Shanta Kumar and Jagat Prakesh Nadda want to take back Mr. Singh into the party fold as latter have been reported to have closed door meeting with the HLP leader in the past.

Grade Calculator Tutorial
This article, as well as the in the embedded video below, contain a simple tutorial on how to use our Grade Calculator as well as a thorough breakdown of the calculations behind it.
How to use our Grade Calculator
Our grade calculator is very easy to use and it involves two different options for calculating the final exam grade needed to obtain a desired overall course grade. These options are listed below:
1) If you know your Current Grade, select Yes (note that this is the current course grade before taking your final exam)
2) If you don't know your Current Grade, Select No
For the second option, you would need to know all the scores or grades of your course work such as assignments, midterms, labs, homework, etc. Once you input these, as well as the weight or worth of each course work, our calculator automatically calculates your Current Grade as well as the Weight of the Final. The breakdown of the calculations behind both options are shown in the sections below.
Option 1: You Know your Current Grade
An example of our grade calculator for when you know your current grade is shown to the right. The example has inputs of 80% for the Desired Grade, 70% for the Current Grade, and 40% for the Weight of the Final Exam. The resulting Grade Needed on the Final Exam is calculated, which is 95%, as well as the minimum and maximum attainable course grades, which are 42% and 82% respectively.
The calculation for solving the Grade Needed on the Final Exam follows the concept of a weighted averaged and the resulting equation used is shown below:
Desired Grade * Total Weight = Current Grade * Weight of Current Grade + Final Grade * Weight of Final Grade
If we simplify the equation above by abbreviating each of the terms we get:
D*WT = C*WC + F*WF
Now the concept of "weights" simply means how big of a chunk of the total possible grade is any given grade worth. In our case the total possible grade, or total weight (WT) is just 100% and is broken down into two parts: Course Work (which is represented by the Weight of Current Grade (WC) and the Weight of the Final Exam (WF). Thus we have:
WT = WC + WF
WT = 100%, WF = 40%
Rearranging to solve for WC we get:
WC = WT - WF = 100% - 40% = 60%
Percentages as Units
Another important note to consider is that percentages can be viewed in the same way as any other unit, such as feet, inches, kilograms, pounds, etc., because in this case the conversion is simply dividing the percentage by 100. Thus 100% = 100/100 = 1 and 7% = 7/100 = 0.07. The idea behind percentages is to represent ratios and fractions in terms of being a fraction of the number 100 because it is often times easier to understand this way. For example, the fraction 4/5 = 0.80 = (0.80 *100)% = 80% and always equals 80/100. Thus the fraction 80/100, although the same as 4/5, is easier to comprehend because it deals with the very common number 100.
Solving for the Final Exam Grade
Now to get back on track with the derivation above for the Final Exam Grade, F, needed to get a Desired Grade, D, we can simply rearrange the equation shown above and input the known terms as follows:
D*WT = C*WC + F*WF
F = (D*WT - C*WC ) / WF = (80% * 100% - 70% * 60%) / 40%
Now if we consider the percentages, %, simply as units and cancel accordingly as well as factor out the remaining percentage unit, we obtain:
F = (80*100% - 70*60%) / 40 = (80*100/40 - 70*60/40) % = 95%
Thus we need 95% on the final exam to obtain a desired overall course grade of 80%.
Minimum Possible Course Grade
The minimum possible grade is for the case when you obtain 0% on your final exam, or in other words, the lowest possible grade on your final exam. In this case use the s

------------answer-----------------------
>>BY JESSICA WILKERSON, PhD Candidate in History, UNC-Chapel Hill I recently had a conversation with a family member—let’s call her Sally—who is convinced that our cousin, who is poor and struggles with drug addiction, got pregnant so that she could receive more Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, or food stamps. “You think she sees a baby as her ticket to more food?” I asked, perplexed. “Well, she probably sells her food stamps for drugs,” Sally explained. I responded that I’m pretty sure that would be very difficult, if not impossible, but it’s no use: Sally is convinced that our cousin—who has been so crippled by drug addiction that she cannot work and has lost custody of her children—is manipulating the system. Without any evidence that this is the case (reports show that “trafficking” food stamps is extremely rare), this is Sally’s ready anecdote that food stamps are ineffective.
Sally is not alone, and she is not unreasonable for thinking that the program is flawed. The public debate on the food stamp program often focuses on problems, from stories of widespread abuse, to >>reports linking food stamps to obesity and diabetes, to warnings that the program is a fundamental cause of the nation’s debt. Such reports have only multiplied as debates on the Farm Bill—legislation that funds agriculture and nutrition programs—reignited in Congress with the last extension set to expire in January. The message thus far has been that cuts are in order (beyond the $5 billion that went into effect on November 1). The Senate has proposed $4.5 billion in additional cuts in the coming decade while the House proposed $40 billion.
The history of food stamps is too often missing in these debates. In the early 1960s a series of studies showed that hunger and malnutrition were pervasive in poor regions of the country. Doctors reported high rates of anemia in infants, stunted growth and low hemoglobin levels in children, and pregnant women suffering from nutritional deficiencies. Prompted by these findings, national public figures addressed the question: What can we do about hunger and malnutrition in our nation? That question motivated President Lyndon B. Johnson and his administration to oversee the Food Stamp Act of 1964, legislation that built on food assistance programs established during the Great Depression. In his statement upon signing the legislation, Johnson declared that in a nation like ours, with abundant food, no child should go hungry. With the right amount of cooperation between state and federal governments, hunger was a problem that could be solved.
The effects of the Food Stamp Act were not immediate. As we continue to consider the role of food assistance in our society, we should remember the many poor and working mothers who fought for better access to food stamps in the 1960s. In the years just after the Food Stamp Act passed, there were many problems with the program. Families had to purchase food stamps, making them unavailable for the most cash-poor households. Moreover, not all counties offered the program, so many people did without.
In 1968 Senator Robert F. Kennedy joined civil rights and labor groups to investigate poverty-related hunger across the nation. At the public hearings, mothers from Texas, Kentucky, Georgia, and South Carolina testif

What are the two options provided by the Grade Calculator for calculating the final exam grade needed to obtain a desired overall course grade
------------correct----------------------
Grade Calculator Tutorial
This article, as well as the in the embedded video below, contain a simple tutorial on how to use our Grade Calculator as well as a thorough breakdown of the calculations behind it.
How to use our Grade Calculator
Our grade calculator is very easy to use and it involves two different options for calculating the final exam grade needed to obtain a desired overall course grade. These options are listed below:
1) If you know your Current Grade, select Yes (note that this is the current course grade before taking your final exam)
2) If you don't know your Current Grade, Select No
For the second option, you would need to know all the scores or grades of your course work such as assignments, midterms, labs, homework, etc. Once you input these, as well as the weight or worth of each course work, our calculator automatically calculates your Current Grade as well as the Weight of the Final. The breakdown of the calculations behind both options are shown in the sections below.
Option 1: You Know your Current Grade
An example of our grade calculator for when you know your current grade is shown to the right. The example has inputs of 80% for the Desired Grade, 70% for the Current Grade, and 40% for the Weight of the Final Exam. The resulting Grade Needed on the Final Exam is calculated, which is 95%, as well as the minimum and maximum attainable course grades, which are 42% and 82% respectively.
The calculation for solving the Grade Needed on the Final Exam follows the concept of a weighted averaged and the resulting equation used is shown below:
Desired Grade * Total Weight = Current Grade * Weight of Current Grade + Final Grade * Weight of Final Grade
If we simplify the equation above by abbreviating each of the terms we get:
D*WT = C*WC + F*WF
Now the concept of "weights" simply means how big of a chunk of the total possible grade is any given grade worth. In our case the total possible grade, or total weight (WT) is just 100% and is broken down into two parts: Course Work (which is represented by the Weight of Current Grade (WC) and the Weight of the Final Exam (WF). Thus we have:
WT = WC + WF
WT = 100%, WF = 40%
Rearranging to solve for WC we get:
WC = WT - WF = 100% - 40% = 60%
Percentages as Units
Another important note to consider is that percentages can be viewed in the same way as any other unit, such as feet, inches, kilograms, pounds, etc., because in this case the conversion is simply dividing the percentage by 100. Thus 100% = 100/100 = 1 and 7% = 7/100 = 0.07. The idea behind percentages is to represent ratios and fractions in terms of being a fraction of the number 100 because it is often times easier to understand this way. For example, the fraction 4/5 = 0.80 = (0.80 *100)% = 80% and always equals 80/100. Thus the fraction 80/100, although the same as 4/5, is easier to comprehend because it deals with the very common number 100.
Solving for the Final Exam Grade
Now to get back on track with the derivation above for the Final Exam Grade, F, needed to get a Desired Grade, D, we can simply rearrange the equation shown above and input the known terms as follows:
D*WT = C*WC + F*WF
F = (D*WT - C*WC ) / WF = (80% * 100% - 70% * 60%) / 40%
Now if we consider the percentages, %, simply as units and cancel accordingly as well as factor out the remaining percentage unit, we obtain:
F = (80*100% - 70*60%) / 40 = (80*100/40 - 70*60/40) % = 95%
Thus we need 95% on the final exam to obtain a desired overall course grade of 80%.
Minimum Possible Course Grade
The minimum possible grade is for the case when you obtain 0% on your final exam, or in other words, the lowest possible grade on your final exam. In this case use the s

------------question-----------------------
What standard did the Court find should apply to causes of action arising pursuant to Section 287.780 regarding workers' compensation discrimination
------------correct----------------------
rkers’ compensation rights. This Section does not contain the words “exclusively”, “solely” or “only” to support the exclusive causation standard. Therefore, prior cases that required exercise of workers’ compensation rights as the exclusive cause of discharge have flawed reasoning as they are unsupported by the plain language in the Statute and should not be followed.
The Court found the “contributing factor” standard should apply to causes of action that arise pursuant to Section 287.780. This standard serves two purposes: first, the contributory factor language is consistent with the legislature’s use of the phrase “in any way” and fulfills the purpose of the Statue, and second, this standard now aligns workers’ compensation discrimination with other Missouri employment discrimination laws. The Court noted there can be no tolerance for employment discrimination in the work place and that this was illegal and reprehensible. Employer’s argument was that abandoning the exclusive causation standard would permit an employee who was fired for legitimate reasons such as tardiness, absenteeism or incompetence at work to still be able to maintain a cause of action for discharge if the worker could persuade a fact finder that, in addition to other causes, a cause of discharge was the exercise of rights under the workers’ compensation law.
This case decision offers employees more protection in exercising their workers’ compensation rights and less fear from being terminated or discriminated against in their employment. It also demonstrates the law will not tolerate even a portion of an employer’s motivation to be discriminatory when discharging an employee.

What steps are recommended for checking the integrity of downloaded files from the Kolab Server release
------------correct----------------------
ropped because it is no longer supported by Debian ether.
As soon as they have synced, you can also use the the mirrors listed on http://kolab.org/mirrors.html
You can check the integrity of the downloaded files by importing our file distribution key and verify the OpenPGP signature and SHA1 checksums:
$ wget https://ssl.intevation.de/Intevation-Distribution-Key.asc
$ gpg –import Intevation-Distribution-Key.asc
$ gpg –verify SHA1SUMS.sig
$ sha1sum -c SHA1SUMS
This release marks the end of a long development cycle. After over 2 years, the master and the stable branch are (more or less) in sync again. We
introduced many new features and fixed a large number of bugs. We tested the release intensively but due to the massive code changes, we might have missed something or even introduced new bugs.
Before you use this release in a critical environment, we’d like you to test it. Please report any problems you encounter in our bug tracker: https://bugzilla.kolabsys.com/
Depending on the number and severity of bugs, we will issue an updated release soon. We already have a number of fixes in the queue such as the today’s Z-push 1.5.2 release, so Kolab 2.3.1 will come soon.
I’d like to thank a few people for their help, namely and in no particular order:
– Paul and Georg, for giving me the chance to work on a great project like Kolab
– Bernhard for his coordination
– Thomas and Sascha for their support, especially during this week
– Bogo for the awesome new look of the webadmin
– Jeroen for his input and providing me the infrastructure I need
– Gunnar for responding so fast to the issues we spotted
Without these people the Kolab Server 2.3 would not be possible. Thank everybody for your hard work!

This release marks the end of a long development cycle. After over 2 years, the master and the stable branch are (more or less) in sync again. We
introduced many new features and fixed a large number of bugs. We tested the release intensively but due to the massive code changes, we might have missed something or even introduced new bugs.
Before you use this release in a critical environment, we’d like you to test it. Please report any problems you encounter in our bug tracker: https://bugzilla.kolabsys.com/
Depending on the number and severity of bugs, we will issue an updated release soon. We already have a number of fixes in the queue such as the today’s Z-push 1.5.2 release, so Kolab 2.3.1 will come soon.
I’d like to thank a few people for their help, namely and in no particular order:
– Paul and Georg, for giving me the chance to work on a great project like Kolab
– Bernhard for his coordination
– Thomas and Sascha for their support, especially during this week
– Bogo for the awesome new look of the webadmin
– Jeroen for his input and providing me the infrastructure I need
– Gunnar for responding so fast to the issues we spotted
Without these people the Kolab Server 2.3 would not be possible. Thank everybody for your hard work!

n Pembrokeshire. It was the last commercial mill in Wales to dye with plant materials. The dye garden behind the wool museum was sadly neglected and overgrown with weeds, although some madder was struggling plantfully on.
The Quilt Centre at Lampeter is in the old Town Hall. Currently, and until November, a collection of antique Welsh quilts is on display with work by Kaffe Fassett and other contemporary quiltmakers. There was a time when this modern work would have held all my attention, but now I am old and grey it was the monochrome historic textiles I found the most beautiful. The collection has been put together by Jen Jones, who realised several years ago that these lovely bedcovers were being discarded as having no value. In a short address to the group, Jen said that she had once seen a farmer using an old quilt to keep a sick cow warm. The Quilt Centre exhibition was superbly done, with work suspended at different angles and heights from an immensely high ceiling. Complexities of lighting were skilfully handled so that nothing appeared overshadowed.
In Calico Kate, a shop for quilting enthusiasts almost next door, I found a set of printed cottons in the blue and white derived from the traditional patterns of resist-dyed indigo. These fabrics seem to be following me around: see this post from earlier this year.
A reminder to anyone following in real time that you can follow AGWSD Summer School at Carmarthen through the posts of several students here on Twitter, using the hashtag #wsdsschoo

What inspired the author after attending Forage
------------correct----------------------
am on, that I have creative license to change things about my practice when things aren't working. Every project and opportunity in my life can viewed as a creative venture (thank you Doug Jones for this reminder)- to learn and grow and also perhaps to fund the next creative opportunity I embark on. Sometimes the opportunities that come across my door demand change, and other times I recognize that I'll need to channel change in order for me to be prepared for potential opportunity or growth.
I came home after Forage feeling completely inspired and overwhelmed at the same time. I needed these pep talks, the encouragement, and the advice more then I thought, but I also am more aware of the out-comes of each decision I need to make for the next stage of my creative life to begin.
The most amazing part of being at Forage was meeting a new community of artists and makers who are making really exciting work. I look forward to connecting with them and introducing a few of them here on my blog too.

What is Jason Donaldson struggling with in his Christian life
------------correct----------------------
MONTGOMERY, AL — According to sources, local man Jason Donaldson is feeling defeated in his Christian walk as he continues to struggle with sin over and over again. Also, he hasn't read or opened his Bible since January 2 of this year.
"Why can't I resist temptation? Why do I struggle so much?" he said as his leather-bound copy of God's Word collected dust under his bed. "This is too hard? Why won't God speak to me? Is he even real?"
Donaldson has reached out to several of his closest friends and family members for answers as to what he might be doing wrong.
"Have you tried therapy?" said his second cousin in a lengthy text message. "My best friend's wife's

When he left I took over his position and created with our clients a professional, friendly and pro-reactive relationship.

------------question-----------------------
What motivated President Lyndon B. Johnson to oversee the Food Stamp Act of 1964
------------correct----------------------
>>BY JESSICA WILKERSON, PhD Candidate in History, UNC-Chapel Hill I recently had a conversation with a family member—let’s call her Sally—who is convinced that our cousin, who is poor and struggles with drug addiction, got pregnant so that she could receive more Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, or food stamps. “You think she sees a baby as her ticket to more food?” I asked, perplexed. “Well, she probably sells her food stamps for drugs,” Sally explained. I responded that I’m pretty sure that would be very difficult, if not impossible, but it’s no use: Sally is convinced that our cousin—who has been so crippled by drug addiction that she cannot work and has lost custody of her children—is manipulating the system. Without any evidence that this is the case (reports show that “trafficking” food stamps is extremely rare), this is Sally’s ready anecdote that food stamps are ineffective.
Sally is not alone, and she is not unreasonable for thinking that the program is flawed. The public debate on the food stamp program often focuses on problems, from stories of widespread abuse, to >>reports linking food stamps to obesity and diabetes, to warnings that the program is a fundamental cause of the nation’s debt. Such reports have only multiplied as debates on the Farm Bill—legislation that funds agriculture and nutrition programs—reignited in Congress with the last extension set to expire in January. The message thus far has been that cuts are in order (beyond the $5 billion that went into effect on November 1). The Senate has proposed $4.5 billion in additional cuts in the coming decade while the House proposed $40 billion.
The history of food stamps is too often missing in these debates. In the early 1960s a series of studies showed that hunger and malnutrition were pervasive in poor regions of the country. Doctors reported high rates of anemia in infants, stunted growth and low hemoglobin levels in children, and pregnant women suffering from nutritional deficiencies. Prompted by these findings, national public figures addressed the question: What can we do about hunger and malnutrition in our nation? That question motivated President Lyndon B. Johnson and his administration to oversee the Food Stamp Act of 1964, legislation that built on food assistance programs established during the Great Depression. In his statement upon signing the legislation, Johnson declared that in a nation like ours, with abundant food, no child should go hungry. With the right amount of cooperation between state and federal governments, hunger was a problem that could be solved.

>>BY JESSICA WILKERSON, PhD Candidate in History, UNC-Chapel Hill I recently had a conversation with a family member—let’s call her Sally—who is convinced that our cousin, who is poor and struggles with drug addiction, got pregnant so that she could receive more Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, or food stamps. “You think she sees a baby as her ticket to more food?” I asked, perplexed. “Well, she probably sells her food stamps for drugs,” Sally explained. I responded that I’m pretty sure that would be very difficult, if not impossible, but it’s no use: Sally is convinced that our cousin—who has been so crippled by drug addiction that she cannot work and has lost custody of her children—is manipulating the system. Without any evidence that this is the case (reports show that “trafficking” food stamps is extremely rare), this is Sally’s ready anecdote that food stamps are ineffective.
Sally is not alone, and she is not unreasonable for thinking that the program is flawed. The public debate on the food stamp program often focuses on problems, from stories of widespread abuse, to >>reports linking food stamps to obesity and diabetes, to warnings that the program is a fundamental cause of the nation’s debt. Such reports have only multiplied as debates on the Farm Bill—legislation that funds agriculture and nutrition programs—reignited in Congress with the last extension set to expire in January. The message thus far has been that cuts are in order (beyond the $5 billion that went into effect on November 1). The Senate has proposed $4.5 billion in additional cuts in the coming decade while the House proposed $40 billion.
The history of food stamps is too often missing in these debates. In the early 1960s a series of studies showed that hunger and malnutrition were pervasive in poor regions of the country. Doctors reported high rates of anemia in infants, stunted growth and low hemoglobin levels in children, and pregnant women suffering from nutritional deficiencies. Prompted by these findings, national public figures addressed the question: What can we do about hunger and malnutrition in our nation? That question motivated President Lyndon B. Johnson and his administration to oversee the Food Stamp Act of 1964, legislation that built on food assistance programs established during the Great Depression. In his statement upon signing the legislation, Johnson declared that in a nation like ours, with abundant food, no child should go hungry. With the right amount of cooperation between state and federal governments, hunger was a problem that could be solved.
The effects of the Food Stamp Act were not immediate. As we continue to consider the role of food assistance in our society, we should remember the many poor and working mothers who fought for better access to food stamps in the 1960s. In the years just after the Food Stamp Act passed, there were many problems with the program. Families had to purchase food stamps, making them unavailable for the most cash-poor households.

AYF’s 85th Anniversary Gala Filled with Memories and Fun
For 85 years, the Armenian Youth Federation has been an organization of family, traditions and growth. On Saturday, July 21, 2018 that growth was celebrated by the very families who created those traditions. The AYF-YOARF’s 85th Anniversary Gala brought multiple generations of AYF lifers together in Warwick, Rhode Island for a night of nostalgia, outlook, and a good old fashioned AYF barehantes.
The night began with a cocktail hour. Upon arrival, guests reconnected with old friends and discussed their time in the AYF over drinks and mezze. At the front of the cocktail hour area stood a table curated with AYF memorabilia from years past. Guests flipped through previous Olympic ad books, looked at printed pictures from events past, and read from old AYF song books. On one of the back walls played a slideshow of pictures which hundreds of members submitted of their fondest AYF memories. Along each of the back walls hung informational posters detailing AYF chapters past and present. A step and repeat with the AYF logo and an image of Karekin Nejdeh (the organization’s founder) was the perfect place to capture a group shot of another great AYF event.
After the cocktail hour came dinner and the program, emceed by U. Josh Tevekelian. U. Josh described his experiences within the organization and the lessons it has taught him that have stuck with him to this day. He then introduced the night’s keynote speakers, U. Rosemary Alashaian, U. Shahan Avedian, and U. Nairi Khachatourian. Each speaker represented a different AYF generation in the room. U. Rosemary spoke of her days in the AYF during its relative infancy and creating a family

ied about their hardships and why they needed food assistance. Many of them outlined in painstaking detail how they spent every penny—on food, medicine, bills, school expenses—and how they often ran out of money and food by the end of the month. Those who received food stamps noted that without them, their lives would have been even more difficult. Food insecurity was often a starting point for women to discuss the many facets of poverty. Their testimonies underscored the lack of well-paying jobs for women, how they often made tough choices about how to spend money as they juggled food and medical expenses, and how they faced financial collapse when a husband died or left a family.
Other women campaigned at their state capitals and county courthouses, demanding that food stamp offices open in their communities. For rural women especially, with no public transportation, poor roads, and miles between them and food stamp offices, traveling to offices was a hardship, one more in a litany of burdens.
Women’s persistent efforts to make the system more responsive to those most in need led up to the 1977 Food Stamp Act, a bipartisan bill which made food stamps more accessible to poor families. Women also played a role in the establishment of the program Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) which assists low-income mothers with children up to age five.
The women who testified to make the food assistance programs work better were not attempting to cheat the system. As one woman testified at a hearing in Kentucky, “Of course I want to pay if I can and I feel that anybody that can pay it should pay it, but right now we just can’t.” It was probably not easy for women to stand before public officials and tick off their household expenses, share their personal hardships, or admit that they could not always feed their children. But they did so because then, just as now, there were pervasive myths that people on welfare and food stamps were lazy, dependent on government, and undeserving of public assistance, even as their experiences as well as the data revealed a complex portrait of poverty.
Because of those women and the public officials who listened to them, food stamps have become one of the most successful social programs in our country. While the SNAP program can be improved, its limitations do not take away from the fact that severe malnutrition, a surprisingly prevalent problem in the 1960s, has been nearly wiped out, according to the >>Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Despite the program’s successes in preventing severe food insecurity, once again we are coming to a moment when years of hard work is being called into question and >>SNAP recipients are facing severe cuts to public assistance. Myths about the food stamp program distract us from that success story. They render invisible the history of how poor and working mothers helped to usher in a program that has shielded thousands from hunger, malnutrition, and the harshest effects of poverty.

What activities are included in the tour at Lake Lucerne, and where does it continue after Sursee
------------correct----------------------
Tour at Lake Lucerne
In the morning the welcome briefing and the bike distribution take place. This tour leads over some smooth hill next to the lake from where you have wonderful views on Lake Lucerne and the famous mountain pasture Rigi. Green meadows and calm streets make the city seem very far away.
After some kilometres you reach Küssnacht with its lake promenade and continue to Weggis where the ship brings you to the other side of the lake. From here you cycle to the peninsula Horw, from where it is easy to cycle back to the city.
From the town centre of Lucerne you go through a small village called Emmenbrücke and up to a small quiet hill, where you find many beautiful farm houses.
There are some ups and downs in this part but you have a lovely view on the close mountain panorama. After some time you reach the monastery Werthenstein und from here you roll smoothly back to Lucerne.
Today’s goal is the picturesque town Sursee situated on the shore of Lake Sempach. You cycle past small villages on calm streets and past farms and meadows until you reach the lake.
Sursee is a perfect spot for a lunch break. Take your time to walk through the lovely town centre and try some Swiss specialities. The way back leads on the shore of the lake.
Visit Lake Zug
The first part of this route is already known from the first days tour. As soon as you reach Küssnacht you make your way to Lake Zug and go on a boat tour to the city of Zug. From here you cycle along the shore until you reach a quiet path back to

What motivated the author to choose Hôtel Le Germain Maple Leaf Square for their weekend visit in Toronto
------------correct----------------------
We’ve just spent a great weekend in Toronto, and are delighted that we tried a property new to us: Hôtel Le Germain Maple Leaf Square.
Readers will know I was highly impressed with my first stay with Hôtel Le Germain, in Québec City late this Spring. It was that experience that had us weighing two Hôtel Le Germain options in Toronto for this weekend visit.
It was a tough choice but, in the end, we went with the newer of the two properties for this visit. This 167-room luxury hotel is part of the Maple Leaf Square, which is home to the Air Canada Centre. While Sia performed there last night, the venue is also home to the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Raptors, the city’s pro hockey and basketball teams. Now you’ll understand the prints over the headboards.
This city loves its hockey, and we were also a short stroll from Canada’s Hockey Hall of Fame.
Speaking of our national sport, I was delighted to spot our own Don Cherry just seconds after we stepping off our plane in Toronto. While known for his colourful attire on television, Mr. Cherry was likely the most elegantly dressed man in the airport.
Our room also offered us an unobstructed view of the landmark CN Tower, seen here from one of our walks, just behind the Roy Thomson Hall.
Hotel Concierge Tatiana was helpful with directions, and we also joined family to make our way to more than a few great locales, including High Park, above and below.
Fall colours were on great display, as you can see.

What activities and experiences did attendees enjoy during the AYF 85th Anniversary Gala

environment for the youth organization. U. Shahan described the lifelong friendships that the AYF fostered along with the organization’s struggle during the times of a non-free and independent Armenia. U. Nairi explained how far the organization has come and how the AYF has affected each of the lives of its members so deeply. After the keynote speakers, U. George Aghjayan gave remarks on behalf of the AYF’s parent organization, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation.
Once the remarks concluded, the dance portion of the night kicked off. As coffee and dessert were served, a band filled with AYF alumni of different generations got the crowd out of their seats and onto the dance floor. Active and former AYF members alike joined in to dance traditional Armenian line dances. At one point the legendary John Berberian took the stage to perform a guest appearance on the oud. As the dancefloor roared on, attendees continued reminiscing and taking pictures, creating new AYF memories and strengthening old ones. Once the dance ended, an after party was held at a nearby bar where attendees could get in one last drink and bite to eat together before calling it a night.
All in all, the AYF 85th Anniversary Gala was a smashing success. Past, present, and future members old and young gathered to celebrate the organization that has had such an effect on their lives. The spirit of the AYF was palpable throughout the event and the organization’s outlook looks bright. Here’s to another 85 years of the AYF-YOARF!

AYF’s 85th Anniversary Gala Filled with Memories and Fun
For 85 years, the Armenian Youth Federation has been an organization of family, traditions and growth. On Saturday, July 21, 2018 that growth was celebrated by the very families who created those traditions. The AYF-YOARF’s 85th Anniversary Gala brought multiple generations of AYF lifers together in Warwick, Rhode Island for a night of nostalgia, outlook, and a good old fashioned AYF barehantes.
The night began with a cocktail hour. Upon arrival, guests reconnected with old friends and discussed their time in the AYF over drinks and mezze. At the front of the cocktail hour area stood a table curated with AYF memorabilia from years past. Guests flipped through previous Olympic ad books, looked at printed pictures from events past, and read from old AYF song books. On one of the back walls played a slideshow of pictures which hundreds of members submitted of their fondest AYF memories. Along each of the back walls hung informational posters detailing AYF chapters past and present. A step and repeat with the AYF logo and an image of Karekin Nejdeh (the organization’s founder) was the perfect place to capture a group shot of another great AYF event.
After the cocktail hour came dinner and the program, emceed by U. Josh Tevekelian. U. Josh described his experiences within the organization and the lessons it has taught him that have stuck with him to this day. He then introduced the night’s keynote speakers, U. Rosemary Alashaian, U. Shahan Avedian, and U. Nairi Khachatourian. Each speaker represented a different AYF generation in the room. U. Rosemary spoke of her days in the AYF during its relative infancy and creating a family

Why Should You Attend?
FTA compliance offers a clear commercial advantage — preferential duties. When goods qualify for preferential treatment, duties are reduced or eliminated. If you can sell or import products with zero tariffs, you can reduce cost and maximize profit.
But It’s Too Complicated!
Free trade agreement compliance can be complicated and time-consuming. Here’s a quick rundown. Preferential rules of origin are used to determine origin of goods under an FTA. These rules of origin use criteria like tariff shift, regional value content, de minimis and so forth. To qualify their goods, manufacturers must pull production bills of material (BOMs) and perform content calculations. If their goods qualify, they must prepare and disseminate FTA certificates of origin. They may also need to reassess their products multiple times during the year. Changes to legislation, costs, BOMs or suppliers can impact whether or not a finished product qualifies under an FTA.
Doing all of this manually is certainly a challenge. That is why most organizations don’t bother. Only 30 percent of multinationals take advantage of all the FTAs that they could. Think about that — 70 percent of multinationals are ignoring a competitive advantage.
Free trade agreements are not static. To give you an example, here are some FTA news stories, all from this week.
The WTO recognizes more than 450 FTAs. For a multinational working across the globe, keeping up with all FTA legislation and remaining compliant can seem too much like hard work.
There is An Easier Way
Yes, FTA compliance can be complicated. But it doesn’t have to be. It is possible to automate the most complex and time-consuming aspects of FTA compliance. Join us on November 28th, 2018 at 1:00 pm CST for a 30 minute webinar. Olivier Joncas

He may have been labelled the ‘quiet one’ but when George Harrison spoke, he deserved to be listened to. He wasn’t as prolific as the Lennon/McCartney partnership, but his songs played an increasingly important part of The Beatles’ legacy. Here are ten of his best songs.
10. If I Needed Someone (1966)
The jingle jangle ring of Rickenbacker guitar that lights up this Revolver album track was said to be influenced by The Byrds’ The Bells Of Rhymney. Some trademark Beatles harmonies made this song an easy target for fellow hitmakers The Hollies to cover – however at the time, their version was lambasted by Harrison and barely scraped into the top twenty.
9. It’s All Too Much (1967)
Tune in and turn on for a classic slice of LSD influenced psych. Recorded in June 1967, this chugging singalong was eventually used on Yellow Submarine over a year later. By then, the Beatles had gone back to simpler sounds. This Harrison freak out is therefore a memorable ode to the summer of love. In 1976, Steve Hillage covered the song on his L album.
8. Long, Long, Long (1968)
A dreamy lament which can be found languishing on side four of the Beatles White Album. Be sure to seek it out, as this is one of Harrison’s most affecting lyrical themes. Note the added effect at the close of the song – the sound of a wine bottle reverberating on top of an amp.
7. Blue Jay Way (1967)
Harrison’s contribution to their Magical Mystery Tour TV film was a suitably phased psychedelic journey. It tells the tale of ‘a fog upon LA’ as Harrison, on a visit to Los Angeles in August 1967, awaited the arrival of Beatles publicist Derek Taylor. Blue Jay Way was the name of the street in Hollywood Hills where he was staying.
6. I Me Mine (1970)
This pleasing waltz time rocker was one of the very last Beatles song to be worked on. Harrison, McCarney and Starr gathered at Abbey Road early in January 1970 to complete the song for the Let It Be movie. Significantly, John was away peace campaigning at the time. Lyrically, it hinted at

What is the formula used to calculate the maximum possible course grade, Max, and how is it derived from the minimum possible course grade, Min
------------correct----------------------
ame initial equation as above but now we replace the desired grade, D, with the Minimum Grade, Min, as shown below:
Min*WT = C*WC + F*WF = C*WC + 0%*WF = C*WC
Dividing WT by both sides and inputting the known terms, we thus have:
Min = C*WC / WT = 70% * 60% / 100% = (70*60/100) % = 42%
Maximum Possible Course Grade
The maximum possible course grade is for the case when you obtain 100% in the final exam, which when assuming there are no bonus marks, is the highest possible grade on the final exam. Also, the maximum possible course grade, Max, is shown below to be just simply the minimum possible course grade plus the weight of the final:
Max*WT = C*WC + F*WF = C*WC + 100% * WF
Dividing by WT , which is the equal to 100%, we obtain:
Max = C*WC / WT + 100% * WF / 100% = C*WC / WT + WF = Min + WF
Thus the Max is simply the Min plus the Weight of the Final and inputting the percentages we get:
Max = 42% + 40% = 82%
Option 2: You Don't Know your Current Grade
An example of our grade calculator for the case when you don’t know your Current Grade is shown below:
In this example, because the question "do you know your current grade?" is answered "no", an extra window appears which has a table that you can manually input all your course work grades and weights in terms of assignments, midterms, homework, labs, etc. Notice that when you input your scores, the grades automatically updates, and vice versa too if you input the grades then your scores automatically update too!
The only difference in this example from the example in Option 1 above is that the Current Grade and Weight of the Final are automatically calculated based on the course work that is inputted in the table. In this example, there are 4 assignments with grades 100%, 85%, 83.8%, and 75% along with their respective weights of 4%, 10%, 8%, and 20%.
The first calculation that is solved is the Weight of the Course Work, otherwise known earlier as the Weight of the Current Grade, WC, and that calculation is simply the sum of the weights of all the course work as shown below:
WC = W1 + W2 + W3 + W4 = (4 + 10 + 8 + 20) % = 42%
The Weight of the Final, WF, is calculated simply as the difference of the Total Weight, WT, and the Weight of the Current Grade:
WT = WC + WF
Rearranging to solve for WF and inputting the percentages we get:
WF = WT - WC = 100% - 42% = 58%
The next calculation solved is Current Grade, C, which solved as the weighted average of all the course work as shown below where the course work grades and weights are abbreviated as G1, G2, G3, G4 and W1, W2, W3, W4:
Dividing both sides by WC and inputting the percentages we obtain:
C = (G1*W1 + G2*W2 + G3*W3 + G4*W4 ) / WC = (100% * 4% + 85% * 10% + 83.8% * 8% + 75% * 20% ) / 42%
C ≈ 81.44%
Now that the Current Grade and Weight of the Final are calculated, the Final Exam Grade as well as the Min and Max possible grades are calculated in exactly the same way as in Option 1:
F = (D*WT - C*WC ) / WF = (80% * 100% - 81.44% * 42%) / 58%
F ≈ 78.96%
Min = C*WC / WT = 70% * 60% / 100% = 81.44% * 42% / 100% ≈ 34.20%
Max = Min + WF = 34.2% + 58% ≈ 92.20%
Bonus Part: Graph and Table of all Possible Course Grades
A bonus feature of our grade calculator is a table and graph showing all the possible course grades you can end up with as well as the associated final exam grades needed. The graph and table can be viewed after calculating your final exam grade. The calculations used in the table and chart are the exact same as the ones we just solved above but the desired grade is a variable that changes throughout the table.

What was special about the narrator's trip to Grand Teton National Park
------------correct----------------------
Photography is the story I fail to put into words.
But in case you want to read my words too...
Northern Utah Photographer and Videographer
So, it's been quite awhile since we made our trip to Grand Teton National Park, and I'm finally getting around to posting it here.
I LOVE the Tetons! The mountains are just so rugged and beautiful, the air is fresh and the wildlife is usually abundant!
The Tetons are most definitely one of my favorite places! This trip though, was extra special! I met a couple of photography gal pals and went shooting with them. The above picture was taken from Signal Mountain--and I woke up at 4 am to get there for the sunrise. It was magical, to say the least! Not only did the sky perform, I got to hang out with my talented friend, Kristen Ryan. (Go check out her website here...you won't regret it!)
The sunrise was stunning looking at the Tetons, as well as when I turned around and looked behind me. These pictures were all t

------------question-----------------------
What actions did women take to improve food assistance programs and what challenges did they face in accessing these services
------------correct----------------------
ied about their hardships and why they needed food assistance. Many of them outlined in painstaking detail how they spent every penny—on food, medicine, bills, school expenses—and how they often ran out of money and food by the end of the month. Those who received food stamps noted that without them, their lives would have been even more difficult. Food insecurity was often a starting point for women to discuss the many facets of poverty. Their testimonies underscored the lack of well-paying jobs for women, how they often made tough choices about how to spend money as they juggled food and medical expenses, and how they faced financial collapse when a husband died or left a family.
Other women campaigned at their state capitals and county courthouses, demanding that food stamp offices open in their communities. For rural women especially, with no public transportation, poor roads, and miles between them and food stamp offices, traveling to offices was a hardship, one more in a litany of burdens.
Women’s persistent efforts to make the system more responsive to those most in need led up to the 1977 Food Stamp Act, a bipartisan bill which made food stamps more accessible to poor families. Women also played a role in the establishment of the program Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) which assists low-income mothers with children up to age five.
The women who testified to make the food assistance programs work better were not attempting to cheat the system. As one woman testified at a hearing in Kentucky, “Of course I want to pay if I can and I feel that anybody that can pay it should pay it, but right now we just can’t.” It was probably not easy for women to stand before public officials and tick off their household expenses, share their personal hardships, or admit that they could not always feed their children. But they did so because then, just as now, there were pervasive myths that people on welfare and food stamps were lazy, dependent on government, and undeserving of public assistance, even as their experiences as well as the data revealed a complex portrait of poverty.
Because of those women and the public officials who listened to them, food stamps have become one of the most successful social programs in our country. While the SNAP program can be improved, its limitations do not take away from the fact that severe malnutrition, a surprisingly prevalent problem in the 1960s, has been nearly wiped out, according to the >>Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Despite the program’s successes in preventing severe food insecurity, once again we are coming to a moment when years of hard work is being called into question and >>SNAP recipients are facing severe cuts to public assistance. Myths about the food stamp program distract us from that success story. They render invisible the history of how poor and working mothers helped to usher in a program that has shielded thousands from hunger, malnutrition, and the harshest effects of poverty.

Their testimonies underscored the lack of well-paying jobs for women, how they often made tough choices about how to spend money as they juggled food and medical expenses, and how they faced financial collapse when a husband died or left a family.
Other women campaigned at their state capitals and county courthouses, demanding that food stamp offices open in their communities. For rural women especially, with no public transportation, poor roads, and miles between them and food stamp offices, traveling to offices was a hardship, one more in a litany of burdens.
Women’s persistent efforts to make the system more responsive to those most in need led up to the 1977 Food Stamp Act, a bipartisan bill which made food stamps more accessible to poor families. Women also played a role in the establishment of the program Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) which assists low-income mothers with children up to age five.
The women who testified to make the food assistance programs work better were not attempting to cheat the system. As one woman testified at a hearing in Kentucky, “Of course I want to pay if I can and I feel that anybody that can pay it should pay it, but right now we just can’t.” It was probably not easy for women to stand before public officials and tick off their household expenses, share their personal hardships, or admit that they could not always feed their children. But they did so because then, just as now, there were pervasive myths that people on welfare and food stamps were lazy, dependent on government, and undeserving of public assistance, even as their experiences as well as the data revealed a complex portrait of poverty.
Because of those women and the public officials who listened to them, food stamps have become one of the most successful social programs in our country. While the SNAP program can be improved, its limitations do not take away from the fact that severe malnutrition, a surprisingly prevalent problem in the 1960s, has been nearly wiped out, according to the >>Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Despite the program’s successes in preventing severe food insecurity, once again we are coming to a moment when years of hard work is being called into question and >>SNAP recipients are facing severe cuts to public assistance. Myths about the food stamp program distract us from that success story. They render invisible the history of how poor and working mothers helped to usher in a program that has shielded thousands from hunger, malnutrition, and the harshest effects of poverty.

rkers’ compensation rights. This Section does not contain the words “exclusively”, “solely” or “only” to support the exclusive causation standard. Therefore, prior cases that required exercise of workers’ compensation rights as the exclusive cause of discharge have flawed reasoning as they are unsupported by the plain language in the Statute and should not be followed.
The Court found the “contributing factor” standard should apply to causes of action that arise pursuant to Section 287.780. This standard serves two purposes: first, the contributory factor language is consistent with the legislature’s use of the phrase “in any way” and fulfills the purpose of the Statue, and second, this standard now aligns workers’ compensation discrimination with other Missouri employment discrimination laws. The Court noted there can be no tolerance for employment discrimination in the work place and that this was illegal and reprehensible. Employer’s argument was that abandoning the exclusive causation standard would permit an employee who was fired for legitimate reasons such as tardiness, absenteeism or incompetence at work to still be able to maintain a cause of action for discharge if the worker could persuade a fact finder that, in addition to other causes, a cause of discharge was the exercise of rights under the workers’ compensation law.
This case decision offers employees more protection in exercising their workers’ compensation rights and less fear from being terminated or discriminated against in their employment. It also demonstrates the law will not tolerate even a portion of an employer’s motivation to be discriminatory when discharging an employee.

MONTGOMERY, AL — According to sources, local man Jason Donaldson is feeling defeated in his Christian walk as he continues to struggle with sin over and over again. Also, he hasn't read or opened his Bible since January 2 of this year.

Donaldson has reached out to several of his closest friends and family members for answers as to what he might be doing wrong.

Being unable to afford $1,000 per month for therapy, Donaldson has begun searching the internet for answers as to what might help him. In addition, he has read Jesus Calling by Sarah Young and tried meditation, but nothing seems to be working.
"If only God would speak to me in the times I needed to hear his voice most, this would be easier," said the frustrated man.
At publishing time, the man started watching Jordan Peterson videos and became very intrigued by these "biblical writings" the Canadian professor was talking about.

sed to shoot with that type of film. Today, there are limited resources in terms of projectors that can play 70mm film, let alone projectionists trained to expertly show these types of films on a regular basis.
Essentially, 35mm film did to 70mm film what digital film is currently doing to 35mm film… making it obsolete. 35mm film was more manipulable for different formats, and could be squeezed and bent more easily without distortion, unlike 70mm film.
The Digital Revolution
Traditional motion pictures are recorded on analog film frames, whereas digital film is recorded as digital video images. That is a fundamental difference that creates a very different visual experience for movie-goers who prefer “the real thing”. Digital film is captured like a digital photograph, using light sensors and digital receptors to resolve the image, but that’s only the very basic version.
High-definition video (Hi-def) has even better resolution, and this has since been followed up by 2K and 4K, creating an arms race to create the most incredibly clear and detailed movies on the market. Digital film is useful and preferred in many instances because it can be crunched down to whatever size is most convenient, without losing much resolution. For example, a new movie that is shot on digital film, rather than celluloid film, can be manipulated and shrunk to fit on the screen of a tablet or smartphone without compromising picture quality.
In a mobile, device-oriented society, this flexible capability makes it more profitable and sensible for most directors to shoot films in a digital format. Even most old movies have been re-recorded in digital formats for that same reason – ease of distribution and consumption.
One might think that with our ever-advancing digital technology, the resolution would be far better in a high-definition digital film, making the discussion of 70mm vs. digital superfluous. However, high-format celluloid films (70mm) have relatively comparable, if not better, resolution than high-definition digital films. There is also an authentic edge to old-school cinematography, which is often lost in the glossy, sterile, and polished appearance of digital projection.
While neither of these two formats can be called “better” than the other, the decision of whether to support or see a digital film vs. a 70mm film truly comes down to personal preference. For traditional film lovers, a movie shot in 70mm will always be superior to the plasticized images of a digital film, whereas superhero blockbuster fans are almost certainly digital film supporters, considering those CGI effects and epic battle scenes would likely be impossible without digital magic!

The Winnipeg School Division has more than 33,000 students in total, according to its latest annual report.
Recruit, retain more teachers
Dumont’s motion, which passed unanimously at the school board’s Dec. 2 board meeting, asks for a five-year analysis of enrolment levels, including students who transition to IB and advanced-placement programs instead. The feasibility of each program in French will be evaluated as well.
“If it’s something that through our analysis, we can see that would encourage our students to continue their high school education in French … I think that would be a benefit,” Dumont said.
Peter Dorrington, who sits on WSD’s French immersion district advisory council, told the board meeting that some parents feel the division focuses on enticing parents to enrol their kids, but not enough attention is paid afterwards.
The division is also being asked to address ways to recruit and retain French immersion teachers.
The motion suggests Winnipeg School Division consider a new program for prospective French immersion teachers modelled on the Build from Within program.
That program certifies Indigenous high school students with teaching aspirations to become educational assistants, in an effort to get more Indigenous teachers into classrooms.
Dumont’s motion will be referred to the division’s policy and program committee for further study

A very recent Missouri Supreme Court decision, John Templemire v. W&M Welding, Inc., 2014 Mo. LEXIS 111, determined the proper causation standard an employee must demonstrate to make a case for retaliatory discharge under the Missouri Workers’ Compensation Statute.
According to RSMo 287.780 “No employer or agent shall discharge or in any way discriminate against any employee for exercising any of his (or her) rights under this chapter. Any employee who has been discharged or discriminated against shall have a civil action for damages against his (or her) employer.” This means that an employer may not terminate an employee due to the fact that the employee has exercised his or her rights regarding a workers’ compensation claim against the employer.
The question was whether employee had to show his filing of a claim was the exclusive or only reason why employer fired him or her, or whether this filing of a claim caused or contributed to the discharge, even though it may not have been the only reason, for example, employee had disciplinary write-ups as well.
The Court went through a causation analysis, looking to the Missouri Human Rights Act (“the MHRA”) and public policy wrongful termination claims decisions. Several prior case decisions held that there must be an exclusive or direct causal relationship between plaintiff’s actions and defendant’s actions, i.e. that the exclusive cause of plaintiff’s discharge was the filing of her claim.
The Court in Templemire looked to the plain language of Section 287.780, which prohibits an employer from discharging or in any way discriminating against an employee for exercising his or her wo

A very recent Missouri Supreme Court decision, John Templemire v. W&M Welding, Inc., 2014 Mo. LEXIS 111, determined the proper causation standard an employee must demonstrate to make a case for retaliatory discharge under the Missouri Workers’ Compensation Statute.
According to RSMo 287.780 “No employer or agent shall discharge or in any way discriminate against any employee for exercising any of his (or her) rights under this chapter. Any employee who has been discharged or discriminated against shall have a civil action for damages against his (or her) employer.” This means that an employer may not terminate an employee due to the fact that the employee has exercised his or her rights regarding a workers’ compensation claim against the employer.
The question was whether employee had to show his filing of a claim was the exclusive or only reason why employer fired him or her, or whether this filing of a claim caused or contributed to the discharge, even though it may not have been the only reason, for example, employee had disciplinary write-ups as well.

am on, that I have creative license to change things about my practice when things aren't working. Every project and opportunity in my life can viewed as a creative venture (thank you Doug Jones for this reminder)- to learn and grow and also perhaps to fund the next creative opportunity I embark on. Sometimes the opportunities that come across my door demand change, and other times I recognize that I'll need to channel change in order for me to be prepared for potential opportunity or growth.
I came home after Forage feeling completely inspired and overwhelmed at the same time. I needed these pep talks, the encouragement, and the advice more then I thought, but I also am more aware of the out-comes of each decision I need to make for the next stage of my creative life to begin.
The most amazing part of being at Forage was meeting a new community of artists and makers who are making really exciting work. I look forward to connecting with them and introducing a few of them here on my blog too.

y across the square from the entrance to the massive Union Station, home to trains and subway lines.
Between subway lines, street cars and good shoes, we saw many other great sights.
The hotel is also in walking distance of Bay Street and the business district, as well as fine examples of older architecture.
Most will wait for another post, but here’s a preview at some particularly striking properties – in the Annex, on our way to the St. Lawrence Market, and at the University of Toronto.
Be prepared to be impressed with this property’s showers. As was the case when I stayed with this brand in Québec City, the oversized rain shower is exposed to the general living area – but you have the option of capturing privacy with wooden blinds on the shower’s outer walls.
I love Molton Brown toiletries, and we both appreciated the his-and-hers closets and ample storage.
Style and Great Little Touches
The brand also offers some of the healthier Continental breakfasts you might find on offer and, yes, those are three rows of apples adjacent to our elevator. We appreciated stellar service from Karyl at breakfast both mornings, and Concierge Tatiana was very helpful with directions and suggestions.
I find Le Germain to be big on little touches. Turndown service includes water and boxed chocolates, and there are urns in the hallways for those who would like to top up their carafes. We’re off to the Big Apple next, but are already looking forward to returning to this property.

Winnipeg’s largest school division will consider adding an International Baccalaureate program in French to keep students from leaving their studies in French immersion.
Officials with the Winnipeg School Division say they will study the feasibility of offering the enriched university entrance-focused program, in light of division numbers that show the number of students in French immersion begins to drop as they approach high school.
One theory is that students are signing up for an IB or advanced-placement program instead, which are only offered in English. In kindergarten to Grade 12 French immersion programs, the majority of instruction is done in French.
“We know that the numbers are dropping. We just want to take a little bit deeper [look] into ‘why does that happen?'” said WSD trustee Jamie Dumont, who adds there are likely a number of reasons behind the drop-off in French immersion enrolment.
Numbers showing the decline were previously shared with trustees at a closed-door meeting. CBC asked for those numbers, but the division did not reproduce the statistics on Friday.
Despite the drop in numbers as students approach high school, overall enrolment in French immersion in the division has increased significantly in the past decade.
The number of French immersion students went from 3,353 in 2008-09 to 4,717 in September 2018, the division says.

We’ve just spent a great weekend in Toronto, and are delighted that we tried a property new to us: Hôtel Le Germain Maple Leaf Square.
Readers will know I was highly impressed with my first stay with Hôtel Le Germain, in Québec City late this Spring. It was that experience that had us weighing two Hôtel Le Germain options in Toronto for this weekend visit.
It was a tough choice but, in the end, we went with the newer of the two properties for this visit. This 167-room luxury hotel is part of the Maple Leaf Square, which is home to the Air Canada Centre. While Sia performed there last night, the venue is also home to the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Raptors, the city’s pro hockey and basketball teams. Now you’ll understand the prints over the headboards.
This city loves its hockey, and we were also a short stroll from Canada’s Hockey Hall of Fame.
Speaking of our national sport, I was delighted to spot our own Don Cherry just seconds after we stepping off our plane in Toronto. While known for his colourful attire on television, Mr. Cherry was likely the most elegantly dressed man in the airport.
Our room also offered us an unobstructed view of the landmark CN Tower, seen here from one of our walks, just behind the Roy Thomson Hall.
Hotel Concierge Tatiana was helpful with directions, and we also joined family to make our way to more than a few great locales, including High Park, above and below.
Fall colours were on great display, as you can see.

aken within one hour, and you can see how the sky changed!
That afternoon and evening I got to hang out with my friend Michelle Olmstead. She is also very talented, and what's funny is we live only a half an hour away from each other and have never gotten together in Utah to go shoot.
We wanted to shoot sunset at the Snake River Overlook, but alas, there wasn't a cloud in the sky by the mountains, so the sunset was rather sub-par. I settled for some silhouette shots, trying to get those beautiful rays. Remember how I said to always look behind? Well, that evening when I looked behind me, it was gorgeous skies and clouds.
I also went down Mormon Row for a few barn shots in the late afternoon/early evening. It was spectacular!
Our last morning there, I woke up early again (yawn...) to go capture sunrise at Schwabacher's Landing. The iconic spot of the Tetons. It was gorgeous!
Well, it was a lovely trip! I can't wait to go back again and shoot there!

What kind of Christmas items did Miley Cyrus say she wanted to include in her all-black tree design
------------correct----------------------
for the holiday season.
“I want an all-black tree this year,” she explained on the KISS FM Breakfast Show in November 2020. “I wanna do, like, goth Christmas. I think instead of a garland do, like, rosaries, like, upside-down studded crosses and like, yeah, very goth, medieval kinda vibes.”
The Hannah Montana alum added that Christmas with her family always ends in “fistfights, and usually with each one of us removing ourselves and slamming the door in some way and a lot of apology texts.”
Cyrus added, “I mean we’re all kind of conspiracy theorists and I remember one year we got onto the topic of, like, aliens and it ended with my brothers not talking for a week and my mom crying.”
“At this time of year, I am careful not to switch on the radio because those novelty jingles make me homicidal and plunge me into the heart of Scrooge territory,” he said at the time. “I think Christmas turns us all into Scrooge. Everyone is trying to throw happy stuff at you, and that’s when I come over all humbug.”

------------question-----------------------
What specific aspect of French immersion education is Dumont's motion asking the Winnipeg School Division to analyze
------------correct----------------------
The Winnipeg School Division has more than 33,000 students in total, according to its latest annual report.
Recruit, retain more teachers
Dumont’s motion, which passed unanimously at the school board’s Dec. 2 board meeting, asks for a five-year analysis of enrolment levels, including students who transition to IB and advanced-placement programs instead. The feasibility of each program in French will be evaluated as well.
“If it’s something that through our analysis, we can see that would encourage our students to continue their high school education in French … I think that would be a benefit,” Dumont said.
Peter Dorrington, who sits on WSD’s French immersion district advisory council, told the board meeting that some parents feel the division focuses on enticing parents to enrol their kids, but not enough attention is paid afterwards.
The division is also being asked to address ways to recruit and retain French immersion teachers.
The motion suggests Winnipeg School Division consider a new program for prospective French immersion teachers modelled on the Build from Within program.
That program certifies Indigenous high school students with teaching aspirations to become educational assistants, in an effort to get more Indigenous teachers into classrooms.
Dumont’s motion will be referred to the division’s policy and program committee for further study

What was Jen Jones' contribution to the collection of quilts on display at the Quilt Centre in Lampeter
------------correct----------------------
n Pembrokeshire. It was the last commercial mill in Wales to dye with plant materials. The dye garden behind the wool museum was sadly neglected and overgrown with weeds, although some madder was struggling plantfully on.
The Quilt Centre at Lampeter is in the old Town Hall. Currently, and until November, a collection of antique Welsh quilts is on display with work by Kaffe Fassett and other contemporary quiltmakers. There was a time when this modern work would have held all my attention, but now I am old and grey it was the monochrome historic textiles I found the most beautiful. The collection has been put together by Jen Jones, who realised several years ago that these lovely bedcovers were being discarded as having no value. In a short address to the group, Jen said that she had once seen a farmer using an old quilt to keep a sick cow warm. The Quilt Centre exhibition was superbly done, with work suspended at different angles and heights from an immensely high ceiling. Complexities of lighting were skilfully handled so that nothing appeared overshadowed.
In Calico Kate, a shop for quilting enthusiasts almost next door, I found a set of printed cottons in the blue and white derived from the traditional patterns of resist-dyed indigo. These fabrics seem to be following me around: see this post from earlier this year.
A reminder to anyone following in real time that you can follow AGWSD Summer School at Carmarthen through the posts of several students here on Twitter, using the hashtag #wsdsschoo

What are the key issues the panel discussion titled 'Check Instead: the Colonial Matrix of Power!' will address regarding artistic and cultural interventions in Southeastern Europe
------------correct----------------------
Panel: Check Instead: the Colonial Matrix of Power!*
The panel discussion will deal with following issues:
What are the (violent) cultural/artistic interventions in spaces outside of the First Capitalist World that are taking place in the present? What is the logic behind interventions of private financial institutions in artistic and cultural space of so-called Southeastern Europe? What is their relation to public institutions? How can we understand these interventions within the framework of re-awakened Austrian imperialist aspirations? How are interventions by actors other than governments and private financial institutions (for example artists, curators) connected to coloniality and western exceptionalism? How would an artistic intervention which de-links from the global capitalist understanding of intervention look like? What are or would be counter-strategies?
Panelists from left to right: Ivana Marjanović (PhD student, Academy of Fine Arts Vienna), Ana Hoffner (artist), Therese Kaufmann (theoretician, eipcp Vienna), Marina Gržinić (artist and theoretician, Vienna/Ljubljana), Marissa Lobo (anonymous), Miltiadis Gerothanasis (anonymous)

The project is part of Squatting Teachers initiative within the context of the university protests. It is organized by Ana Hoffner and Ivana Marjanovic and supported by the Post Conceptual Art Practices Class, Academy of Fine Arts Vienna.
The notion of representation in the history of exhibition production in Western Europe has often been based on sexist and racist stereotypes and is directly related to the coloniality of power.

What is notable about as the contributions of George Harrison's songs to The Beatles' legacy
------------correct----------------------
He may have been labelled the ‘quiet one’ but when George Harrison spoke, he deserved to be listened to. He wasn’t as prolific as the Lennon/McCartney partnership, but his songs played an increasingly important part of The Beatles’ legacy. Here are ten of his best songs.
10. If I Needed Someone (1966)
The jingle jangle ring of Rickenbacker guitar that lights up this Revolver album track was said to be influenced by The Byrds’ The Bells Of Rhymney. Some trademark Beatles harmonies made this song an easy target for fellow hitmakers The Hollies to cover – however at the time, their version was lambasted by Harrison and barely scraped into the top twenty.
9. It’s All Too Much (1967)
Tune in and turn on for a classic slice of LSD influenced psych. Recorded in June 1967, this chugging singalong was eventually used on Yellow Submarine over a year later. By then, the Beatles had gone back to simpler sounds. This Harrison freak out is therefore a memorable ode to the summer of love. In 1976, Steve Hillage covered the song on his L album.
8. Long, Long, Long (1968)
A dreamy lament which can be found languishing on side four of the Beatles White Album. Be sure to seek it out, as this is one of Harrison’s most affecting lyrical themes. Note the added effect at the close of the song – the sound of a wine bottle reverberating on top of an amp.
7. Blue Jay Way (1967)
Harrison’s contribution to their Magical Mystery Tour TV film was a suitably phased psychedelic journey. It tells the tale of ‘a fog upon LA’ as Harrison, on a visit to Los Angeles in August 1967, awaited the arrival of Beatles publicist Derek Taylor. Blue Jay Way was the name of the street in Hollywood Hills where he was staying.
6. I Me Mine (1970)
This pleasing waltz time rocker was one of the very last Beatles song to be worked on. Harrison, McCarney and Starr gathered at Abbey Road early in January 1970 to complete the song for the Let It Be movie. Significantly, John was away peace campaigning at the time. Lyrically, it hinted at

What factors do star ratings for Medicare Advantage plans assess
------------correct----------------------
) Plans-PPO plans use a network of providers but you are able to go outside the network to seek care, usually at higher cost-sharing, such as 50% co-insurance. You can also see a specialist, without needing a referral from your primary care doctor. You may also be able to utilize specialty facilities like M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, if they are willing to bill out-of-network with your PPO plan. In most cases, prescription drugs are covered in Medicare PPO plans. If you find out you don’t have drug coverage with your plan, you cannot join a stand-alone prescription drug plan (Part D).
Special Needs Plans (SNP’s)-These plans provide benefits and services to people with specific diseases, certain health care needs (like Diabetes), or limited incomes (such as on Medicaid). SNP’s cover the same services that all Medicare Advantage plans cover, but you will have to continuously meet the special conditions to stay on this type of plan. For example, if I am on a Medicare Advantage SEP Dual plan (low income), and I lose Medicaid, this could result in me having to go back to a regular Medicare Advantage plan. With these types of plans, you generally must get care from providers in the network, but some SNP’s may be PPO plans that allow you to go out-of-network. There will be a strong emphasis on managed care with these plans, so referrals will most likely be needed to see a specialist. All SNP’s must provide prescription drug coverage.
Private Fee-For-Service (PFFS) Plans- This kind of Medicare Advantage plan allows you to go to any Medicare-approved provider that accepts the plan’s payment terms and will agree to treat you. If your PFFS plan has a network, these providers have already agreed to the plan’s terms. You will not need a referral to see a specialist with this type of plan. Keep in mind that in a medical emergency, the nearest provider must treat you. In most cases, prescription drugs are covered in Medicare PPFS plans. If you find out you don’t have drug coverage with your plan, you cannot join a stand-alone prescription drug plan (Part D).
Medical Savings Account (MSA) Plans-MSA plans combine a high-deductible insurance plan with a medical savings account that you can use to pay for your health care costs. Besides the Part A&B services that MSA plans must cover, some plans may offer additional benefits like dental coverage for an extra cost. With an MSA plan, you can choose your health care providers. You will need to get a separate stand-alone prescription drug plan (Part D) with this plan option.
When Can I Sign Up For A Medicare Advantage Plan?
You can sign up for a Medicare Advantage plan during the enrollment periods below:
Initial Enrollment Period-When you first become eligible for Medicare, you can sign up during what is referred to as the Initial Enrollment Period (IEP). This 7-month period begins 3 months before you turn 65, the month of your 65th birthday, and ends 3 months after you turn 65. This period is crucial, because you have to make a decision on how you want to receive your Medicare benefits (ie. Medicare Advantage or Medicare Supplement). So when does coverage start? Well it depends on when you enroll. If you sign up during the first 3 months of your IEP, in most cases, your coverage starts the first day of your birthday month. So if I enroll on March 24th and my birthday month is April, my Medicare Advantage plan would start April 1st. If you enrolled after the initial 3 months, your start date for coverage will be delayed. After enrolling during your IEP, any plan changes can only be made at certain times of the year, as you’ll learn below.
Annual Enrollment Period-Remember when we talked earlier about those commercials on television, depicting seniors overly excited about their Medicare plan benefits? Well, this is the time of the year when seniors will be bombarded with such ads on television, in the mail, online, and on the phone. Because October 15th- December 7th, anyone who has Medicare can join, switch, or drop a Medicare Advantage plan. Coverage will begin on January 1st, so long as you enrolled before the end of December 7th. We caution you to be wary of all the noise you will hear during this time, and to analyze if your Medicare Advantage plan is still working out for you. It never hurts to see what is out there, but be sure to check that all your doctors, medications, and so forth are covered, despite what the fast-talking agent says! Often here in San Antonio, Texas and beyond, we hear horror stories of dishonest agents who were careless in their assistance with seniors, and put them on plans that were less than ideal for them, or suddenly become “unreachable” after they get the sale. Be careful!
Open Enrollment Period- This period allows you to switch from one Medicare Advantage plan to another (with or without drug coverage), disenroll from a Medicare Advantage plan and go back to Original Medicare. If you choose to do so, you can then join a Medicare prescription drug plan. You cannot however, go from Original Medicare to a Medicare Advantage plan/Medicare prescription drug plan, or switch from one Medicare prescription drug plan to another. This period runs from January 1st through March 31st each year. You can only make one change during this period, and any changes made will be effective the first of the month after the insurance company gets your request. If you are having second-thoughts about a Medicare Advantage plan you choose during AEP, this would be a great opportunity to try out a new plan without having to wait a long time.
Special Enrollment Period- In certain situations, you may be able to join, switch, or drop a Medicare Advantage plan during this period. You must qualify due to certain reasons, such as having both Medicare and Medicaid, receiving “Extra Help” from the government with your Part D drugs, changing where you live and having to enroll in a different Medicare Advantage plan such as from Texas to California, leaving employer coverage, etc. It is vital to pay close attention to deadlines you have during this enrollment period. For instance, you have a 2-month window after your work coverage ends, to acquire a Medicare Advantage plan. If someone is on a SNP plan (remember above) that is tailored for folks on Medicare/Medicaid, they can change to another SNP plan one time during these periods: January-March, April-June, July-September.
Do I Need To Enroll Each Year?
This is a question we get asked often here in San Antonio, Texas, and the short answer is that your plan automatically renews each year as long as you pay the premium and the plan is available in your service area. You do not have to do anything to your coverage, but make sure that the plan is meeting your ongoing needs.
What Are Star Ratings And Why Do They Matter?
Star ratings are a way for consumers to compare the relative quality of care of Medicare Advantage plans. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issues the ratings based on:
- Administrative Results
- Clinical Outcomes
- Plan Member Surveys
Every Medicare Advantage plan receives star ratings from one star (lowest) to five stars (highest). CMS also issues an overall star rating for each plan. This matters because if you run into a plan with a low star rating, you might want to research why! This system also matters on the opposite spectrum, because if you run into a 5-star Medicare Advantage plan in your area, such as in San Antonio, Texas, this creates a Special Enrollment Period in its own right, as between December 8th and November 30th, you can enroll in a 5-star plan, one time.
Do Agents/Brokers Get Paid To Enroll Me On A Medicare Advantage Plan?
Yes. We are real straight-forward folks here at The Harrin Group and want to give you a behind-the-scenes look at compensation. Basically, an agent or broker gets compensated from the insurance company he/she is representing, for every new Medicare Advantage plan enrollment. While we won’t go into exa

What were some of the key topics covered at the Forage Symposium
------------correct----------------------
The Forage Symposium was a 3 day conference jam packed with guest speakers and panel discussions from participating makers, artists and designers. We covered topics like marketing your work, finding your audience, how to apply for grants, issues to consider with outsourcing, social media tips, selling online, and how to juggle family life while being a maker. When I say 'jam packed' I do mean that the schedule pretty much had us in a session from 10 am until 10 pm with small breaks for lunch and dinner. Hosted and planned by Mariko McCrae and her husband Brian in their beautiful studio- it was truly an amazing time to really reflect on what I do as a maker, a mom and a creative person.
At Forage I re-learned that a creative life is ever evolving (I think Bianca was the inspiration on this one)- whether it be in finding new inspiration, launching a new product, moving to a new studio space, or completely changing mediums. It felt empowering to be reminded that whatever stage of the journey I

What is the main focus of the projects discussed in the text about Eastern European art
------------correct----------------------
f representation have appeared. Forces are put together not only to investigate what the creativity of the “developing Other” is about, but also what the “developing Other’s” emancipation is about, or better yet, where the developing Other is now on the scale of the implementation of neo-liberal values.
In 2009 numerous exhibitions have been staged, artworks produced and symposia organized, as Europe was in the euphoria of celebrating the triumph of capitalism: the anniversary of twenty years of the fall of the Berlin Wall. One such project is the Gender Check exhibition, investigating femininity and masculinity in Eastern European art since the 1960s, initiated by the Erste Foundation at the MUMOK.
Our intervention takes such projects as a point of departure for a critical reflection of the ongoing Western investigation and control of democratic values and social emancipation in countries that recently joined, and those which are about to join the EU (as well as in other regions). Exhibiting role models of femininity and masculinity in Eastern Europe follows a strict logic of identity politics as they make it possible to identify, fragmentize, categorize and make the Other visible, and therefore, controllable.
Parallel to that investigation and control of political values, state-legitimized racism and patriarchal models of exclusion in Western countries are perpetually reproduced. Both practices, inside and outside of Western imperial centers, follow the same logic of strengthening former colonial powers through systematic exploitation and marginalization. We can find a continuity of colonial practices in the way that the “Eastern” and “Southern” worlds are perceived as uncivilized, underdeveloped and barbaric and how migrants are constantly supervised, accused and criminalized in Western countries themselves. These institutionalized racist processes, in addition to the constructed exceptionality of Western Europe as progressive and emancipated, are never checked.

5. Within You Without You (1967)
Once more, into the mystic. This Indian-influenced, sitar-led swirl demonstrated Harrison’s growing love for an alternative culture. While other fellow travellers such as Donavon flirted with the sitar, it was Harrison who placed it most successfully in the pop/rock idiom. This Sgt Pepper track is a prime example.
4. Taxman (1966)
Surprisingly, it was Macca who supplied the strident guitar solo of this vibrant opener to the Revolver album. Harrison meanwhile, offered a wry observation of the British tax system – ‘’and you’re working for nobody but me’’. Listen carefully for namechecks for those political buffoons of the day messrs’ Wilson and Heath.
3. Here Comes The Sun (1969)
Written in Eric Clapton’s garden when Harrison sagged off from attending meetings at their Apple HQ, his increasing frustration of life as a fab one flowered into a truly uplifting composition. He added some subtle moog synth effects to a song that is always guaranteed to brighten up the bleakest of days.
2. Something (1969)
Built around the phrase ‘’Something in the way she moves’’ (borrowed from a song by Apple Records artist James Taylor), Harrison’s own maturing songwriting talent created one of the Beatles’ most-covered songs, with Frank Sinatra proclaiming it to be ‘’the greatest love song of the last 50 years’’. In late 1969 it was extracted from the Abbey Road album to become a worldwide hit.
1. While My Guitar Gently Weeps (1968)
This White Album epic started life as a gentle acoustic piece. In rocking it up, he called upon the services of the then Cream member Eric Clapton. Their duel guitar battle is a truly thrilling coda and has ensured that this song remains at the forefront of his considerable Beatle achievements.

This release marks the end of a long development cycle. After over 2 years, the master and the stable branch are (more or less) in sync again. We
introduced many new features and fixed a large number of bugs. We tested the release intensively but due to the massive code changes, we might have missed something or even introduced new bugs.
Before you use this release in a critical environment, we’d like you to test it. Please report any problems you encounter in our bug tracker: https://bugzilla.kolabsys.com/
Depending on the number and severity of bugs, we will issue an updated release soon. We already have a number of fixes in the queue such as the today’s Z-push 1.5.2 release, so Kolab 2.3.1 will come soon.
I’d like to thank a few people for their help, namely and in no particular order:
– Paul and Georg, for giving me the chance to work on a great project like Kolab
– Bernhard for his coordination
– Thomas and Sascha for their support, especially during this week
– Bogo for the awesome new look of the webadmin
– Jeroen for his input and providing me the infrastructure I need
– Gunnar for responding so fast to the issues we spotted
Without these people the Kolab Server 2.3 would not be possible. Thank everybody for your hard work!
