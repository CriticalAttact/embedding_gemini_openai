What do use on powdery mildew?
3% hydrogen peroxide. You can spray it full strength, or do a 50/50 with water. Don’t spray when the sun is shining on the plant, you will burn the leafs.
You should harvest that now! If the plant doesnt have any new pistils showing there will be no further fattening! Not all trichomes show true amber either, so before you start losing trichomes to freezing temps and degradation you should harvest!
This image shows some hairs that are not brown and thus there is still some expansion happening, when they are all brown and no new ones being formed they will be at max expansion.

The Eighth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals just recently handed down a hugely important decision that has received far less attention than it deserves. The case concerned a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests through which radical environmental activists were seeking to obtain personal information about ranchers and farmers—including GPS coordinates to their home address, email addresses, personal phone numbers, and other sensitive information from which one might infer the state of their personal finances. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) initially began to release the requested information in batches, but was then hit with a lawsuit seeking to block further disclosures and to compel EPA to order the activists to return information that had been illegally released.
We filed last spring, arguing that the federal Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of sensitive information
about small business owners. Remarkably EPA and her allies argued small business owners utterly lack standing to challenge disclosure of sensitive records, which federal officers may compile on businesses. Our brief specifically took issue with that rationale
—emphatically making the case that small business owners retain personal privacy protections, notwithstanding their choice to engage in economic activit

The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly
So far this week I've blogged about the wonderful results you can get from sheet masks - The Good
I've also talked about some of the nasty results you can get from sheet masks - The Bad
And now we're going to talk about pimples - The Ugly
On my quest to get rid of those uglies I've come across acne patches. Acne patches are medicated treatments that you put on your pimples.
Here are a few brands I've tried & my opinions...
Warning - The language won't always be pretty!!
Sorry, but I wasn't able to document with pictures how these products work.
I'm going to begin with what I think is the most popular acne patch..
Nexcare Acne Dressing
This is what the box looks like.
Acne Dressing: Hydrocolloid dressing absorbs secretion and promotes healing of acne
The dressing protects acne from dirt and other contaminants
Waterproof and breathable
Clean and dry the skin and hands thoroughly.Remove the film at the back of an acne dressing and cover it on the acne. Fix it tightly by pressing on the rim.Replace when the acne dressing turns white (including full absorption of secretion).The acne dressing should be applied before wearing make-up.
Replace when the acne dressing turns white (indicating full absorption of secretion).If skin becomes red and swollen, or if burning, aching and other forms of irritation occur, cease using and seek medical advice at once.It is normal to find bubbles in the colloid.
One characteristic of Nexcare™ Acne dressing is that it turns white after absorbing the secretion. Replacement should be made once that happens. Check daily the acne's situation. After cleaning and drying, apply a new acne dressing. Even if the acne dressing turns white within a day, it should be replaced. No replacement is needed after the acne is healed.
I really was expecting a great product & this just wasn't it for me. Honestly I had such a hard time getting the patch to stick to my pimple that I don't even know if this product works well. You should use these patches while you sleep, but my patch didn't even make it longer than 2 hours. I heard a few tips as to how to get this to stick to your face, but I really didn't want to apply anything extra to my face. When this product is on your face it is quite noticeable.

For the Cyclones, the attacks hit particularly close to home given the proximity of MCU Park to the World Trade Center. On the first base side of MCU Park is the “Brooklyn Wall of Remembrance” which honors over 400 first responders with a connection to the Brooklyn area, who were killed on September 11, 2001.
“With the tenth anniversary coming up in a few months, the league thought it was a great way for all of us to come together in the same way our country did following the attacks,” said Cohen. “It’s our way of showing that the thousands of people we lost that day may be gone, but they are surely not forgotten.”
The New York-Penn League features seven teams from New York (Staten Island, Brooklyn, Hudson Valley, Batavia, Jamestown, Auburn and Tri-City), two in Pennsylvania and single teams in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland and Vermont. The short-season schedule begins June 17 and runs through Labor Day weekend.

derstated, yet respectful way.”
For the Cyclones, the attacks hit particularly close to home given the proximity of MCU Park to the World Trade Center. On the first base side of MCU Park is the “Brooklyn Wall of Remembrance” which honors over 400 first responders with a connection to the Brooklyn area, who were killed on September 11, 2001.
“With the tenth anniversary coming up in a few months, the league thought it was a great way for all of us to come together in the same way our country did following the attacks,” said Cohen. “It’s our way of showing that the thousands of people we lost that day may be gone, but they are surely not forgotten.”
The New York-Penn League features seven teams from New York (Staten Island, Brooklyn, Hudson Valley, Batavia, Jamestown, Auburn and Tri-City), two in Pennsylvania and single teams in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland and Vermont. The short-season schedule begins June 17 and runs through Labor Day weekend.

From the Principal
You would be hard done by not to know the Grand Bazaar is on this weekend. This celebration recognises our 150-year history, as well as the life of our current College community. Thanks in anticipation to all families and staff who have made preparations. If you haven’t been to one before, you won’t be disappointed – there is something for everyone. See you there!
Term 4 is a busy term for the College. With swimming lessons, graduations, picnics, exams and prize-givings, we will surely be worn out by its end. Despite its liveliness, in classrooms teachers are focusing on curriculum and ensuring students get the outcomes of which they are capable. It is important for the older students to maintain a homework routine, and every student should be reading outside of school each day.
Oscar Romero was made a saint over the weekend. He was a great man, who in the 1970s was called to lead the Catholic Church in El Salvador. When many were silent, Romero stood and proclaimed freedom, human rights and stood up to the political turbulence that was denigrating human life. These inspiring words are attributed to Oscar Romero, but they were never spoken by him…
In memory of Saint Oscar Romero (1917–1980)
A Future Not Our Own
It helps now and then to step back and take a long view.
The Kingdom is not only beyond our efforts,
it is beyond our vision.
We accomplish in our lifetime only a fraction
of the magnificent enterprise that is God’s work.
Nothing we do is complete, which is another way of
saying that the kingdom always lies beyond us.
No statement says all that could be said.
No prayer fully expresses our faith. No confession
brings perfection, no pastoral visit brings wholeness.
No program accomplishes the Church’s mission.
No set of goals and objectives include everything.
This is what we are about. We plant the seeds that one
day will grow. We water the seeds already planted
knowing that they hold future promise.
We lay foundations that will need further development.
We provide yeast that produces effects
far beyond our capabilities.
We cannot do everything, and there is a sense of
liberation in realising this.
This enables us to do something, and to do it very well.
It may be incomplete, but it is a beginning,
a step along the way, an opportunity for the Lord’s
grace to enter and do the rest.
We may never see the end results, but that is the
difference between the master builder and the worker.
We are workers, not master builders, ministers, not
messiahs. We are prophets of a future not our own.
God bless us as we go about building the Reign of God this term.

- Lucy Eade and Sophie Williams (Year 10), who have earned a CSIRO Gold CREST award for their independent science investigations. The nationally recognised award is the highest accolade an Australian student can receive for a science investigation in the CSIRO CREST (Creativity in Science, Engineering and Technology) program.
- Julia Gunn (Year 11), who has earned selection in the Tasmanian Van Demons hockey team, which participates in the Australian Hockey League. Julia is poised to make her national debut in just six-months’ time, when she lines up against Hockeyroos stars playing for the NSW Arrows today.
- Shreya Karunakara (Year 9), Estella Edwards (Year 7), Stefani Khoo (Year 7), Natalie De Cesare (Year 9) and Alyssa Lee (Year 9), who represented St Mary’s College and Tasmania at the International Tournament of Minds final held in Darwin. Fellow team members, Isabella Cox (Year 9) and Emily Walter (Year 8) were unable to attend the competition. While the girls didn’t win, they did an amazing job. More importantly, their teamwork and care for others was outstanding.
- Samantha Rickwood and Amelie Cox (Year 8), who competed in the Australian U16 Girls’ National Aged Club Championships, where they represented Tasmania in water polo.
- Taylah Pickett (Year 12), whose creative artwork was selected as part of Reconciliation Tasmania’s ‘Youth Speakout’ Project. Taylah has been invited to talk about her artwork at the Youth Speakout event, which is taking place tonight at the Hobart Town Hall.

ded to make this look a bit rustic too so I sponged the edges of the Very Vanilla and curled the CS a bit. The stars I covered with Crystal effects and sprinkled a little Dazzling Diamonds on them. I stamped some Gorgeous Grunge and them added my Washi Tape. I also used the WT to make little banners off the side of the tag. I think this could make a great Masculine Birthday card.

d just harvest now. From the pictures your plant looks ready. If your thinking of holding out longer, maybe try making a shelter to protect from frost and cold nights.
Good luck and happy growing
Thanks, just made it thru 3 days of rain, gonna push it til grey mold. Good weather comin
I hear ya. No mold yet but it’s gonna come, I’ll wait til then. Working on hack to see trikes better. Laser pointer lens on phone. What do use on powdery mildew?
@Vader [quote=“Vader, post:7, topic:55353”]
What do use on powdery mildew?
3% hydrogen peroxide. You can spray it full strength, or do a 50/50 with water. Don’t spray when the sun is shining on the plant, you will burn the leafs.
You should harvest that now! If the plant doesnt have any new pistils showing there will be no further fattening! Not all trichomes show true amber either, so before you start losing trichomes to freezing temps and degradation you should harvest!
This image shows some hairs that are not brown and thus there is still some expansion happening, when they are all brown and no new ones being formed they will be at max expansion.

This patch has just the right amount of stickiness to it, so the patch doesn't fall off when you sleep. I've tried these patches for whiteheads & I haven't seen any difference the next day.
These patches can be difficult to come by if you don't have a Face Shop in your area. =/
Cettua Acne Trouble Clear Patch w/ Tea Tree Oil
This is what the box looks like.
Contains Tea tree oil which helps to aid in the healing process of blemished skin and refreshed healthy skin. Contains Salicylic Acid, which removes keratin on the skin., where clogged pores with oil and impurities so helps to penetrate into skin and effectively treat acne by killing bacteria that cause pimple growth.
I use these patches on whiteheads, I don't feel that they work that well on cystic acne. These patches are my absolutely favorite!!! They truly remove all of the pus from pimple!! It's really gross, but it really does a great job. These patches don't have any smell & they have never left me skin with any irritation. Be warned that these patches are really sticky & they may be a little difficult to get off, you have to remove them gently or you could cause scarring. If you do try these, leave a reminder for yourself that you have this on!!! These little suckers are almost invisible come morning time. I think the combination of tea tree oil & salicylic acid is the reason why this product works so well.
You can buy these on ebay or at The Face Shop, the cost is about $6 per box.
FYI: I noticed at Rite Aid today that Clean & Clear & Acne Free also make acne patches..
Have you tried acne patches before..??

What decision did the Eighth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals recently make regarding FOIA requests and the disclosure of personal information about ranchers and farmers
------------correct----------------------
The Eighth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals just recently handed down a hugely important decision that has received far less attention than it deserves. The case concerned a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests through which radical environmental activists were seeking to obtain personal information about ranchers and farmers—including GPS coordinates to their home address, email addresses, personal phone numbers, and other sensitive information from which one might infer the state of their personal finances. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) initially began to release the requested information in batches, but was then hit with a lawsuit seeking to block further disclosures and to compel EPA to order the activists to return information that had been illegally released.
We filed last spring, arguing that the federal Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of sensitive information
about small business owners. Remarkably EPA and her allies argued small business owners utterly lack standing to challenge disclosure of sensitive records, which federal officers may compile on businesses. Our brief specifically took issue with that rationale
—emphatically making the case that small business owners retain personal privacy protections, notwithstanding their choice to engage in economic activit

Several factors can cause wethers to be more prone to calculi.
In the present study, although bucks had higher final and harvest BW, they failed to produce higher DP when compared to wethers. Differential body tissue growth in bucks and wethers may contribute to higher non-edible body parts that lowered DP in bucks and higher proportion of carcass fat (KPF; p<0.02) in wethers that may have contributed to higher DP in wether goats.
Of these, about 2,200 wethers were slaughtered to provide detailed carcass quality data, and 2,600 ewes are being evaluated for their maternal characteristics.
"Despite wether lambs being back on the year, ewe lambs were up PS6.50.
VICTORY: Teesside's Roger Williams on his way to winning the intermediate class at Wether Hill Farm
You have your commercial ranchers who are raising goats in quantities to take to market, there are people whose sole focus is on breeding animals, and you also have those who sell wethers to the 4-H and FFA exhibitors, not to forget those who do a combination of some or all of these.
The hillside market on the outskirts of Lairg reverberated to enthusiastic bidding for wethers from all the regular lowland buyers as lambs from crofters and farmers from across the country met better-thanexpected prices, although trade for ewe lambs became "pickier" as the day wound to a close and fell short of last year's outstanding sale.
The Scot, still to win a Major, is weighing up wether to use a new putter with a hole in the middle.
A younger or out of condition wether can do about 20% of its body weight.
Newcastle brought in Worrall as a tactical substitute for Wethers in heat seven but it was Etheridge who made the early lead, only for Lasse Bjerre to open the throttle and fly past the Bandit down the back straight in a Diamonds 2-4.
Steve Worrall scored paid 15 that night, Max Clegg also among the points with12 and Matty Wethers battling hard for seven riding against his former club.
A 5-1 for Newcastle by Matthew Wethers and Lasse Bjerre put Newcastle ahead again 28-2

Everything up to that point appears to work correctly.
Unfortunately, my company is blocking access to certain sites that may help, so I'm coming here. What does error code -12272 mean? Does it point to one particular aspect, like mismatched algorithms or keys that won't work? Does everything run over port 5222 or are there other ports involved?
Thank you for any guidance anyone can provide!

What significant issue did SABO want to investigate regarding young people's views on housing
------------correct----------------------
Big Data Analysis for SABO – the Swedish Association of Public Housing Companies.
SABO, the public housing companies' partner organization, wanted to better understand how young people view their homes, what they dream about, what type of housing they wanted and how big the housing question is in relation to other issues.
To address this, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of young people's discussion of accommodation in social media. Of the 30 million blogs posts analysed, 2.5 million were related to accommodation, compared to 1.5 million about fashion and shopping. Accommodation was thus the one of the biggest issues in social media. The blog analysis also found large differences in how young people search for housing –

What were the charges against Angel Rubio-Gonzalez in his appeal case
------------correct----------------------
674 F.2d 1067
10 Fed. R. Evid. Serv. 697
UNITED STATES of America, Plaintiff-Appellee,
Angel RUBIO-GONZALEZ, Defendant-Appellant.
United States Court of Appeals,
May 6, 1982.
Nicasio Dimas, Jr., San Antonio, Tex., for defendant-appellant.
Sidney Powell, Asst. U. S. Atty., San Antonio, Tex., for plaintiff-appellee.
Appeal from the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas.
Before RUBIN, SAM D. JOHNSON and GARWOOD, Circuit Judges.
GARWOOD, Circuit Judge:
Appellant Rubio-Gonzalez appeals his conviction, following a jury trial, on both counts of a two-count indictment charging violations of 8 U.S.C.A. § 1324(a)(3).1 The first count charged that on or about June 29, 1981, in Helotes, Texas, at D & B Materials Company, appellant, willfully and knowingly, did, and did attempt to, conceal, harbor and shield from detection Rodolfo Correa-Anaya, who, as appellant then knew, was an alien not duly admitted nor lawfully entitled to enter and reside in the United States. The second count was a duplication of the first except that it related to a different illegal alien, Felipe Torres-Cruz.
The evidence tended to show the following.2 Acting on information received by their San Antonio office, four Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) criminal investigators went to the D & B Materials Company premises in Helotes, Texas, on June 29, 1981, at approximately 1:30 p. m. to determine if illegal aliens were employed there. Investigators Marroquin and Osborn drove an unmarked car bearing government license plates, and investigators Garcia and Vasquez drove an unmarked van having government license plates and containing a wire cage-like panel separating the driver's seat from the rest of the van. When the agents arrived at D & B Materials Company, they stopped both vehicles at a trailer that appeared to be the office. Garcia went inside to advise that the agents were there and to ask permission to check the employees to determine if they were aliens illegally in the United States. Vasquez waited outside for Garcia to return; Osborn and Marroquin remained in their car.
While waiting outside the trailer, Vasquez saw a man, later identified as the appellant, Angel Rubio-Gonzalez, arrive on a motorcycle and go in the trailer. Garcia also saw Rubio-Gonzalez enter the trailer, talk to one of the secretaries, and leave. When appellant came out of the trailer, Vasquez started talking to him about his motorcycle. During the conversation the agent determined that Rubio-Gonzalez was an employee, so he identified himself, displayed his badge and asked to see appellant's identification. Appellant produced documentation showing he was a resident alien.3
While waiting for Garcia to come out of the trailer, Marroquin and Osborn drove around the work area to see if there was another office. They saw several people working near a rock crusher, and parked and watched them at a distance for a few minutes, then drove back toward the trailer. As they neared the trailer, they observed Vasquez talking to appellant, who appeared to be putting his wallet back in his pocket and who thereafter got on his motorcycle and started driving toward the work area. When Marroquin and Osborn arrived, Vasquez told them appellant was an employee and a lawful resident alien. Marroquin and Osborn then decided to follow appellant, turned their car around, and followed approximately 100 yards behind him as he rode his motorcycle toward the work area. Appellant drove to the bottom of the gravel mound near the rock crusher where two men, later identified as Correa-Anaya (Correa) and Torres-Cruz (Torres), were working, dropped his motorcycle and ran up the hill toward them. The agents observed him gesturing and apparently pointing in the agents' direction, whereupon the workers immediately dropped their tools and ran. The distance was too great for the agents to hear whether anything was said, but Correa and Torres testified that appellant said, in Spanish, "immigration" or "immigration is here." The agents then drove around the mound of gravel and caught Correa and Torres, and a third alien who had been in the vicinity, attempting to escape. Two other illegal aliens were apprehended running in various directions from the general area of the rock crusher. While the investigators were chasing the aliens, appellant got back on his motorcycle and drove toward the exit, but Marroquin stopped him.
The five aliens were put in the van. They asked that they be allowed to obtain their personal belongings, and directed the agents to the "barracks" where they had been living on the property. As the agents approached this building, two aliens ran out of it. The agents chased these men, but caught only one, appellant's brother. Each of the six aliens apprehended admitted that he was in the country illegally and had no claim to United States citizenship.
Correa and Torres each testified that he was born in Mexico and that he and his parents were Mexican citizens, that neither he nor his parents were United States citizens or had been legally admitted into the United States, and that on the occasion in question he was not legally in this country. Each was present in the country on this occasion by virtue of an illegal entry, and each had entered the United States by walking or swimming across the Rio Grande near Piedras Negras. Upon crossing, each had traveled first to Spofford and then directly to Helotes, where they had been working ever since at the D & B Materials Company plant. Correa arrived in October 1980, Torres in late April 1981. While at the D & B Materials Company plant they spoke Spanish exclusively. Though another party was apparently the owner, each knew appellant as the foreman or "boss," and each had talked to him from time to time since their arrival, always in Spanish. Each was from the Mexican State of Guanajuato, Correa's hometown being Jerecauro, and Torres' being Aposeo El Grande. Correa testified he did not talk with appellant about his or appellant's hometown or state or his status in the United States. Torres' testimony did not reflect whether these subjects were mentioned when he talked with appellant. Each testified they knew appellant's brother while at the D & B Materials Company. Torres answered "yes" when asked "was he also an alien, like you." Correa said he knew the brother's hometown but did not know if he was illegally in the country. Correa and Torres testified that approximately ten illegal aliens were working at the plant at the time of their apprehension. Each testified that prior to appellant's warning to them they were unaware of the presence of the immigration officers, and that they ran in an attempt to escape from the immigration officers.
Immigration records indicated appellant had been ordered deported as an illegal alien in April 1971, and March 1972, that on the former occasion he asserted he had made three prior entries into the United States, that his parents were Mexican citizens, as was he, and that his hometown was Aposeo El Grande, in the state of Guanajuato, Mexico. These records showed he had previously illegally entered by wading across the river near Eagle Pass. The records concerning his prior deportations also showed that he claimed to be married to an American citizen who was petitioning on his behalf for him to be granted resident alien status, although he admitted also being, or having been, married to another woman in Guanajuato.
Appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction on several grounds.
He first contends that there is no evidence that his conduct formed any part of the process, chain of events or successive stages of smuggling the aliens into the United States. While appellant accurately characterizes the evidence as failing to show that he was in any way connected with the smuggling process, nevertheless we have held that section 1324(a)(3) is not so limited. United States v. Cantu, 557 F.2d 1173, 1

What significant event is the Grand Bazaar celebrating this weekend at St Mary’s College
------------correct----------------------
From the Principal
You would be hard done by not to know the Grand Bazaar is on this weekend. This celebration recognises our 150-year history, as well as the life of our current College community. Thanks in anticipation to all families and staff who have made preparations. If you haven’t been to one before, you won’t be disappointed – there is something for everyone. See you there!
Term 4 is a busy term for the College. With swimming lessons, graduations, picnics, exams and prize-givings, we will surely be worn out by its end. Despite its liveliness, in classrooms teachers are focusing on curriculum and ensuring students get the outcomes of which they are capable. It is important for the older students to maintain a homework routine, and every student should be reading outside of school each day.
Oscar Romero was made a saint over the weekend. He was a great man, who in the 1970s was called to lead the Catholic Church in El Salvador. When many were silent, Romero stood and proclaimed freedom, human rights and stood up to the political turbulence that was denigrating human life. These inspiring words are attributed to Oscar Romero, but they were never spoken by him…
In memory of Saint Oscar Romero (1917–1980)
A Future Not Our Own
It helps now and then to step back and take a long view.
The Kingdom is not only beyond our efforts,
it is beyond our vision.
We accomplish in our lifetime only a fraction
of the magnificent enterprise that is God’s work.
Nothing we do is complete, which is another way of
saying that the kingdom always lies beyond us.
No statement says all that could be said.
No prayer fully expresses our faith. No confession
brings perfection, no pastoral visit brings wholeness.
No program accomplishes the Church’s mission.
No set of goals and objectives include everything.
This is what we are about. We plant the seeds that one
day will grow. We water the seeds already planted
knowing that they hold future promise.
We lay foundations that will need further development.
We provide yeast that produces effects
far beyond our capabilities.
We cannot do everything, and there is a sense of
liberation in realising this.
This enables us to do something, and to do it very well.
It may be incomplete, but it is a beginning,
a step along the way, an opportunity for the Lord’s
grace to enter and do the rest.
We may never see the end results, but that is the
difference between the master builder and the worker.
We are workers, not master builders, ministers, not
messiahs. We are prophets of a future not our own.
God bless us as we go about building the Reign of God this term.

What ingredients are used in the Celaskan Clear White Intensive Clean Patch to help treat acne
------------correct----------------------
emish Clear White Intensive Clean Patch
Acne mask acts as a film to soothe acne after just one night with a strong treatment effect, fast, effective and not leave deep wounds on the skin surface extracted from green tea and complex with anti-bacterial.
Usage: Wash your face clean, dry and glue pieces to film spots to acne treatment. Optimum time is from 8-12 hours, is suitable to sleep at night. Can combine more products Quick & Clean - First Aid Gel to enhance efficiency.
I use these patches for cystic acne, I can't say they work wonders, but they do help a lot! I find that using this for 2 nights in a row gets rid of my pimple quite quickly. This patch has just the right amount of stickiness to it, so the patch doesn't fall off when you sleep. I've tried these patches for whiteheads & I haven't seen any difference the next day.
These patches can be difficult to come by if you don't have a Face Shop in your area. =/
Cettua Acne Trouble Clear Patch w/ Tea Tree Oil
This is what the box looks like.
Contains Tea tree oil which helps to aid in the healing process of blemished skin and refreshed healthy skin. Contains Salicylic Acid, which removes keratin on the skin., where clogged pores with oil and impurities so helps to penetrate into skin and effectively treat acne by killing bacteria that cause pimple growth.
I use these patches on whiteheads, I don't feel that they work that well on cystic acne. These patches are my absolutely favorite!!! They truly remove all of the pus from pimple!! It's really gross, but it really does a great job. These patches don't have any smell & they have never left me skin with any irritation. Be warned that these patches are really sticky & they may be a little difficult to get off, you have to remove them gently or you could cause scarring. If you do try these, leave a reminder for yourself that you have this on!!! These little suckers are almost invisible come morning time. I think the combination of tea tree oil & salicylic acid is the reason why this product works so well.
You can buy these on ebay or at The Face Shop, the cost is about $6 per box.
FYI: I noticed at Rite Aid today that Clean & Clear & Acne Free also make acne patches..
Have you tried acne patches before..??
FTC Disclaimer-I purchased these items myself

Today, Relevant Radio is joined by over 5,700 individuals and families who signed up to participate in the #FastforLife. This initiative is an observance of prayer and fasting in solidarity with the March for Life and Pro-life movement.
For those who can’t attend the events today in Washington D.C., Fast for Life has become a way to participate in the Pro-life movement from wherever they are. Of the 5,700, there are participants from all 50 states and from 21 countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Croatia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, The Netherlands, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States of America, and Vietnam! How beautiful that support for the most vulnerable members of society—the unborn, elderly, sick or disabled, etc.—truly spans the globe.
If you’d like to join us, it’s not too late! You will find more information and a form to sign up here: relevantradio.com/fast
Here are just a few of the participants and how they’re observing #FastforLife today:
Woody from California: My three girls and I are going to fast all day and pray. They are 14 ,16, 18 and want to do this. It will be the first time for all of us to just run on water but we are excited to be part of such a great cause.
Melanie from Phoenix, AZ: I wish I could be in the March…..I will be fasting today and do a family rosary tonight after school and work.
Harry and Dottie D from PA: We’ll be fasting and praying today for all the marchers and for the success of all your efforts to end abortion.
Matthew from Chicago: My niece and nephew are heading to D.C. for the March. I’m going to support them and the cause by saying a rosary and fasting from meat tomorrow. God bless everyone participating.
Nate from NJ: I am going to fast (one small meal, one regular meal) and offer up my day, any stress, works, joys, good deeds for the end of abortion. God Bless and thank you, Relevant Radio.
Kevin from Minneapolis, MN: Total fast… just liquids.
Mary Pat from Utah: I will be fasting tomorrow while my daughter marches at the March for Life in D.C. as part of a group of Georgetown students. I thank Relevant Radio for your commitment to protecting the dignity of human life.
Lucy from Wisconsin: I am pregnant with my second child and have been suffering from pretty debilitating anxiety during this pregnancy. Housework has been particularly debilitating for me so I am going to clear the surfaces in my house and fold the laundry as an offering for the cause for life and the marchers.
Tessa from Iowa: Fasting from social media, Netflix and fast food! #forthebabies
Katie from TX: I will be abstaining from meat, sweets, and carbonated drinks.
Nick: I will be flying for the Army, which usually means I miss lunch, but I will also bring my prayers on mission with us. St. Michael pray for justice, St. Francis of Assisi pray for peace, St. Maximilian Kolbe pray for hope! Sacred Heart of Jesus have mercy on us!
Susanne from Augusta, Maine: I will fast and pray. Depending on expected snowy weather I will hopefully be able to attend morning Mass.
Cha from Ireland: Fasting

What features of Halo 3: ODST does the text segment highlight as either positive or negative
------------correct----------------------
n get, since you don't regenerate health, which leaves you in finding health kiosks, which can be a pain in the ass to get. Needless to say, I'm not too impressed with the open world and if this was the selling point for this title, they really messed it up.
I do feel that the flashbacks are done very well and should have gotten more face time since they will be
the bigger action part of the game. Each flashback is triggered by you finding a certain object in the open world. When you find this certain object, you play that characters time after the drop, all leading to the ending. The voice-work for the characters is top-notch and enjoyable to listen to. It really gives life to the game when the Rookie plays the clichèd "Strong, Silent Type" which has been over-used for way too long. Also, I won't spoil the ending, but getting to the ending is probably the most boring piece of Halo
I've ever played. Unless you like driving the Warthog. Then you'll be in heaven.
Halo 3: ODST brings along a "new" mode: Firefight. For anyone who has played Gears of War 2, this
should act pretty familiar. Firefight is the Halo
version of Horde with the ability to use Skulls to make it harder and get more points. That's about it. Add on with the already mentioned multiplayer maps and you have Halo 3: ODST
in a nutshell. For what should've been an expansion, customers had to shelve out $60 for a game that used a worn tactic to increase hours played, added some multiplayer maps to the fray, and put Horde mode in Halo
form. As great as Halo 3
was, this does not feel like the same game or a better game released by the same company. This should've stayed as an expansion pack, but I can't recommend this to anyone outside of the Hardcore Halo
- + Flashback Scenes are Awesome
- + Voice Acting is Good
- - Tacked on Open World...
- - ...And It's Still Short.
- - Lackluster Firefight
- - Nothing really new for MP
- - Absurd Price Tag

The Native American Kiowa tribe wore clothing sourced from their surrounding environment. They used materials made from animal skins and decorated their clothing with paint, beads or fringe.Continue Reading
Men of the Kiowa tribe wore leather legging and breechcloths. Breechcloths are strips of cloth or leather worn between the legs with the ends tucked over a belt on either side of the body. Because breechcloths leave the legs bare, men often protected their legs with leggings. Leggings are tube-like pant legs attached to the breechcloth belt. The pant legs of the leggings are separate, unconnected pieces. When going to war, Kiowa men wore hats made from otter pelts. These head coverings had a turban-like shape.

y. And the good news is that the Eighth Circuit agreed with us—holding that affected farmers and ranchers can assert a privacy interest, so as to prohibit disclosure of sensitive information. Also the mere fact that contested information might otherwise be obtained through an exhaustive search of state and local records does not mean that business owners are without right to object to federal compilation and release of those materials.
In this case, we were specifically worried that the information would be used by activists to harass and intimidate small business ranchers and farmers. But on a more fundamental level, we thought it important to clarify that small business owners—in all industries—have a right under federal law to object to federal agencies releasing information that may invade their own personal privacy interests. In a statement on the heels of the decision
, Karen Harned, Executive Director of the NFIB Small Business Legal Center, said: “The idea that EPA has the authority to release the private home addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of farmers and ranchers is preposterous. The EPA violated the privacy and trust of American farmers and their families. Today, the Court rightly upheld federal privacy laws and protected farmers and ranchers from potentially dangerous exposures.

What are some criticisms mentioned about the pricing and content of Halo 3: ODST
------------correct----------------------
New Mombasa, a city known for its glory and beautiful outlook, a gem on Earth of its time; before the
Covenant showed up. A Covenant ride into slipspace and New Mombasa, once immaculate and free, now a war-zone between the Humans and the Enemy. But humanity has a secret weapon: the Orbital Drop Shock Trooper. You are one of these secret weapons, and you're to drop into the fray and finish the problem, at whatever cost. But does this game sound as epic as it should?
When Halo 3: ODST was first announced, it was said to priced as an expansion instead of an actual
retail price. But with their updates, they decided to make it a full $60 price tag. With its sellers being the Open-World your ODST can roam, the new addition of Firefight, and more multiplayer maps for its stout multiplayer experience. Even though it comes with all of this, the game feels WAY too small for the $60 price tag. Though ODST
does have more content than Halo 3
, the multiplayer is the exact same multiplayer as Halo 3
with a couple new maps. This game would've been perfect at around the $30-40 price tag, but this does not warrant a full retail price tag.
I feel this the most on the proposed open world content. It is very surreal to walk around the war-torn
city, for about the first hour or two. When it becomes a constant grind-through to get to the next objective with no real reason to face the enemies, really hurts the whole reason for it being there. The open-world feels like a tacked-on time spender to lengthen the hours of the campaign. I can tell you that half of my game was walking [since there's no sprint.] through the city either finding random collectibles or facing random hordes of Covenant with no reward to it. Your ODST is given a new visor to roam around the darkened city, it will help you run through the enemies with ease and find hidden collectibles. You're given this because you're going to need all your human self ca

ded to make this look a bit rustic too so I sponged the edges of the Very Vanilla and curled the CS a bit. The stars I covered with Crystal effects and sprinkled a little Dazzling Diamonds on them. I stamped some Gorgeous Grunge and them added my Washi Tape. I also used the WT to make little banners off the side of the tag. I think this could make a great Masculine Birthday card.

n get, since you don't regenerate health, which leaves you in finding health kiosks, which can be a pain in the ass to get. Needless to say, I'm not too impressed with the open world and if this was the selling point for this title, they really messed it up.
I do feel that the flashbacks are done very well and should have gotten more face time since they will be
the bigger action part of the game. Each flashback is triggered by you finding a certain object in the open world. When you find this certain object, you play that characters time after the drop, all leading to the ending. The voice-work for the characters is top-notch and enjoyable to listen to. It really gives life to the game when the Rookie plays the clichèd "Strong, Silent Type" which has been over-used for way too long. Also, I won't spoil the ending, but getting to the ending is probably the most boring piece of Halo
I've ever played. Unless you like driving the Warthog. Then you'll be in heaven.
Halo 3: ODST brings along a "new" mode: Firefight. For anyone who has played Gears of War 2, this
should act pretty familiar. Firefight is the Halo
version of Horde with the ability to use Skulls to make it harder and get more points. That's about it. Add on with the already mentioned multiplayer maps and you have Halo 3: ODST
in a nutshell. For what should've been an expansion, customers had to shelve out $60 for a game that used a worn tactic to increase hours played, added some multiplayer maps to the fray, and put Horde mode in Halo
form. As great as Halo 3
was, this does not feel like the same game or a better game released by the same company. This should've stayed as an expansion pack, but I can't recommend this to anyone outside of the Hardcore Halo
- + Flashback Scenes are Awesome
- + Voice Acting is Good
- - Tacked on Open World...
- - ...And It's Still Short.
- - Lackluster Firefight
- - Nothing really new for MP
- - Absurd Price Tag

------------question-----------------------
What factors did the trial court consider when admitting the records of appellant's prior illegal entries into the United States
------------correct----------------------
he jury defining "harboring" as meaning "any conduct tending to substantially facilitate an alien's remaining in the United States illegally." Appellant urges that this instruction is too broad, in that a proper definition should be limited both to actions comprising a part of the successive stages of the smuggling process, and to the provision of shelter or services. As stated above, we reject appellant's contention that subparagraph (3) is limited to activities which constitute a part of the successive stages of the smuggling process. The definition given in the charge comes from the opinions in Cantu, Varkonyi, and Lopez.
In this case the trial court also carefully instructed the jury concerning the employment proviso of section 1324(a) as well as the requirement that appellant not only knew that the alien named in each respective count of the indictment was in fact unlawfully in this country, but that also appellant's concealing, harboring or shielding from detection of such alien, or attempting to do so, was done "willfully or knowingly." In this connection, "knowingly" was defined as "voluntarily and intentionally and not because of a mistake or other innocent reason" and "willfully" was defined as "voluntarily and purposely with the specific intent to do something that the law forbids-that is to say, with a bad purpose either to disobey or to disregard the law." None of these instructions were in any way objected to.
Under the wording of the indictment and the evidence the only matter presented for the jury's consideration was whether Correa and Torres were illegal aliens, whether appellant knew this on the occasion in question, whether he warned them of the presence of the immigration officers under the circumstances testified to by the various witnesses, his state of mind in so doing, and whether such conduct and state of mind on his part amounted to a violation of subparagraph (3) of section 1324(a). The trial court's instructions adequately presented all these questions to the jury. The jury was not allowed to find appellant guilty on the basis of any conduct or any state of mind that would not constitute a violation of subparagraph (3). Under these circumstances, it matters not whether the particular conduct and state of mind at issue be labeled "harboring" or "concealing" or "shielding from detection," for each are equally violative of subparagraph (3). The trial court adequately instructed the jury on what was necessary to convict under section 1324(a)(3) and did not allow the jury to convict on the basis of any conduct not alleged in the indictment and shown in the evidence, or which would not constitute a violation of section 1324(a)(3). The instruction complained of does not present reversible error.5
Appellant's remaining contention is that the court erred in admitting the records showing his prior illegal entries into the United States in 1971 and 1972. No complaint was made at trial, nor is any made here, about the authentication of these records or the method of proof of the matters reflected thereby. Rather, appellant's complaint is that the facts shown were irrelevant and prejudicial, because they were remote in time, did not involve criminal acts, and did not involve acts that were similar to those charged in the instant case. We disagree.
We hold that these records were properly admitted for the limited purpose of showing appellant's knowledge and state of mind, which are clearly elements of the offense charged in each count. We note in passing that the trial court carefully considered the admissibility of these records in a hearing outside the presence of the jury, and concluded that the probative value of this evidence to show appellant's knowledge and state of mind was not outweighed by the dangers of unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, or misleading of the jury. The court carefully instructed the jury when the evidence was admitted, and again in the final charge, that they could consider the evidence only if they first determined, independent of it, that appellant did the acts charged. Even then they could consider the evidence only insofar as it reflected on appellant's knowledge and state of mind on the occasion charged in the indictment. Appellant did not, and does not, complain of these instructions. Indeed, appellant's counsel was specifically asked whether he desired any further instructions in this regard, and he said he did not.
Under Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, "(e)vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts (may be admitted) ... as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident." (Emphasis added.) Under Rule 403 relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of issues or misleading of the jury. Plainly, the trial court properly appraised the issue of the admissibility of this evidence, and the limited purposes for which it could be considered, in accordance with Rules 403 and 404 and the decision of this Court in United States v. Beechum, 582 F.2d 898 (5th Cir. 1978) (en banc), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 920, 99 S.Ct. 1244, 59 L.Ed.2d 472 (1979). In these circumstances the decision to admit the evidence can be disturbed only for an abuse of discretion. United States v. Benton, 637 F.2d 1052, 1056 (5th Cir. 1981). No abuse of discretion is shown here.
The fact that the records did not show that appellant's prior conduct was criminal is immaterial. Rule 404(b) authorizes the admission of prior "acts" as well as "crimes" and "wrongs." Although one of the prior acts occurred slightly more than ten years prior to trial, and was hence outside the time limit provided for in Fed.R.Evid. 609(b), evidence admitted under Rule 404(b) is not controlled by the ten-year limit specified in Rule 609(b), which applies to the quite different matter of admitting evidence of prior convictions to impeach a witness. Of course, if the prior crimes or acts admitted under Rule 404(b) are too remote in time, this may substantially weaken their probative value and hence weigh in favor of their exclusion under Rule 403.
The evidence here was particularly relevant to show appellant's knowledge concerning the practices and procedures of immigration officers and the required documentation for alien workers. We observe that to the extent such prior acts are relevant to the matter of knowledge, rather than being relevant only to intent, remoteness may be less of a factor in determining the probative value of the evidence. The passage of time and changing circumstances are more likely to significantly change one's intent than they are to obliterate knowledge once gained.
We also note that prior to the offer of this evidence by the government, appellant had cross-examined the agents Garcia, Vasquez and Marroquin in an effort to show the numerous circumstances under which one not a citizen of the United States might be legally working in this country, including the case of an alien married to a United States citizen. The appellant was obviously seeking to show that he would not necessarily realize that Correa and Torres were illegal aliens, even though he might realize that they were not United States citizens. Accordingly, appellant's prior experience with the INS and the requirements applicable to alien workers, and particularly the orders for his own deportation notwithstanding his claimed marriage to an American citizen, were especially relevant.6 The evidence was also relevant to appellant's knowledge of the procedures followed by the immigration officers in apprehending and deporting aliens. It tended to show that appellant's purpose in advising Correa and Torres of the presence of the immigration officers was not, as appellant's counsel contended in arguing his motion for instructed verdict, "entirely innocent" or simply the equivalent of "the fire department is here," but was instead an attemp

Men of the Kiowa tribe also wore their hair in braids, sometimes incorporating a pompadour style or wrapping the braid in fur. During cold weather, the Kiowa tribe wore moccasins and buffalo-hide robes.
For special occasions, the Kiowa tribe painted their faces. They had designs specifically for festive celebrations, religious ceremonies and even war. As the Kiowa tribe confronted European styles of dress, they adapted their clothing. Many Kiowa people wore cloth dresses or vests and decorated them with tribal materials or designs.

New Mombasa, a city known for its glory and beautiful outlook, a gem on Earth of its time; before the
Covenant showed up. A Covenant ride into slipspace and New Mombasa, once immaculate and free, now a war-zone between the Humans and the Enemy. But humanity has a secret weapon: the Orbital Drop Shock Trooper. You are one of these secret weapons, and you're to drop into the fray and finish the problem, at whatever cost. But does this game sound as epic as it should?
When Halo 3: ODST was first announced, it was said to priced as an expansion instead of an actual
retail price. But with their updates, they decided to make it a full $60 price tag. With its sellers being the Open-World your ODST can roam, the new addition of Firefight, and more multiplayer maps for its stout multiplayer experience. Even though it comes with all of this, the game feels WAY too small for the $60 price tag. Though ODST
does have more content than Halo 3
, the multiplayer is the exact same multiplayer as Halo 3
with a couple new maps. This game would've been perfect at around the $30-40 price tag, but this does not warrant a full retail price tag.
I feel this the most on the proposed open world content. It is very surreal to walk around the war-torn
city, for about the first hour or two. When it becomes a constant grind-through to get to the next objective with no real reason to face the enemies, really hurts the whole reason for it being there. The open-world feels like a tacked-on time spender to lengthen the hours of the campaign. I can tell you that half of my game was walking [since there's no sprint.] through the city either finding random collectibles or facing random hordes of Covenant with no reward to it. Your ODST is given a new visor to roam around the darkened city, it will help you run through the enemies with ease and find hidden collectibles. You're given this because you're going to need all your human self ca

Without prejudice to the case, the MHRA said it was seriously concerned about what appeared to be an increase in substance abuse-related violence and accidents in our community. Drugs are the bane of a healthy society and economy and must be tackled with the highest sense of urgency by the relevant authorities to avoid drug epidemics. The MHRA believes that there are enough indicators to merit a national debate to raise awareness of the issue and significantly increase action to curb society-wide use of illicit drugs, which can be one of the leading causes of mental health problems and all their negative effects.

What is the purpose of the Australian National University's undergraduate scholarship for students from St Mary’s College
------------correct----------------------
tional Thinking Challenge
Congratulations to the following Year 3-12 students who received awards in the Bebras Computational Thinking Challenge, which was held at the College last month.
The winning house will be presented with the trophy at the next whole school assembly.
Fun facts about the Bebras Computational Thinking Challenge
- The Bebras Australia Computational Thinking Challenge started in Australia in 2014 through the CSIRO Education & Outreach program, Digital Careers. However, the Bebras Challenge has a long and world-wide history.
- Founded in 2004 by Professor Valentina Dagiene from University of Vilnius in Lithuania, the first Bebras challenge involved 3470 students from 146 schools.
- The Bebras Challenge has grown so much that there are now almost 60 countries, with more than 1.6 million students, participating last year alone!
- In case you’re wondering, Bebras is the Lithuanian word for ‘beaver’.
- The International Bebras Community chose this name because beavers endeavour for perfection in their everyday activities. They are known to be hard working and intelligent, so it’s only right that the challenge be named after them.

Progressive Achievement Testing
This term, students in Year 1-9 will be participating in online Progressive Achievement Testing (PAT) online.
The test, which will take place during students’ normal class sessions, is used in thousands of schools in Australia and around the world.
The approach focuses on assessing and monitoring student growth over time and is underpinned by an understanding that students of the same age and in the same year of school can be at very different points in their learning and development.
Why do schools use PAT tests?
- They can be used to inform teaching and learning and to assist in planning effective and targeted learning programs.
- They provide a measure of student achievement in each learning area.
- There is a common achievement scale for all tests within a learning area (PAT scale scores allow teachers to compare achievement on the tests within each learning area regardless of year level and the specific test completed and to monitor progress over time).
- They are mapped to the Australian Curriculum.
- They provide overall descriptions of the types of skills mastered and those still to be developed based on test performance.
- Individual and group reports have automatically calculated scores and sorting functions that allow comparison of scores across students, strands, etc.
If you have any queries or concerns about your child’s participation in PAT at St Mary’s College, please contact Michelle Baker at email@example.com

Junior School mural in the making
Local artist Tom O’Hern has created a bit of a stir at the College this week.
The reason? He has started work on a mural in the Junior School line-up area, which will be completed during the school term.
Inspired by the names of our Junior School classes, the painting will feature native Australian flora and fauna, such as wallabies, wombats, bluegum and wattle.
Students and staff are looking forward to witnessing the piece evolve over the coming weeks!

150th Anniversary Grand Bazaar – the countdown is on!
Excitement is mounting at St Mary’s College with just four days to go until our Grand Bazaar makes its long-awaited debut on Sunday 21 October.
The Parents and Friends Association is working tirelessly around the clock to put the finishing touches on the jam-packed program, which will run from 11.00am-2.00pm on the College Green (‘top ground’).
Giant Trailer Hamper Raffle
A big thank you to all families and staff who generously supported our Giant Trailer Hamper Raffle fundraising initiative this morning, and those who have volunteered to contribute to the ‘Cake and Make Stall’ – we’re looking forward to sampling your baked goodies. Information about the Cake and Make Stall went home with families on Monday, along with your plates. If you have any questions, please email me at email@example.com
Don’t forget – raffle books for the Trailer Hamper Raffle are due back to the school by Friday 19 October.
Stalls, entertainment and attractions
We also thank all individuals and groups who have put their hand up to man a stall at the event.
There will be more than 30 stalls – featuring everything from plants and succulents, second-hand clothes and books, a photo booth, fortune telling, white elephant items and 150th merchandise – and a wide variety of family-friendly games and entertainment including Zorb balls, sumo suits, a jumping castle, buried treasure hunting and old-fashioned quoits.
Appetites will be kept in check with a delicious range of hot and cold food, beverages and sweets available for purchase, with a lolly jar, chocolate wheel and trailer raffle for those feeling extra lucky on the day.
We are delighted to announce a new addition to the Grand Bazaar program – the Peddler’s Parade. Be sure to mark the following times in your diary to catch students peddling their wares to fair-goers:
11.30am – Kindergarten
12.30pm – Prep
Helpers urgently needed
While we are at the pointy end of preparations, last-minute helpers are still urgently needed, particularly to man the inflatable stalls (Zorb balls, jumping castle, etc).
We are also still welcoming donations for the chocolate wheel. Donations can include electrical items, hardware items, sports equipment, toys and vouchers.
If you can help out in any way, please email P&F President, Stacey Daley at firstname.lastname@example.org
Thank you in advance for generosity and support. Catch you all on Sunday!

tional Thinking Challenge
Congratulations to the following Year 3-12 students who received awards in the Bebras Computational Thinking Challenge, which was held at the College last month.
The winning house will be presented with the trophy at the next whole school assembly.
Fun facts about the Bebras Computational Thinking Challenge
- The Bebras Australia Computational Thinking Challenge started in Australia in 2014 through the CSIRO Education & Outreach program, Digital Careers. However, the Bebras Challenge has a long and world-wide history.
- Founded in 2004 by Professor Valentina Dagiene from University of Vilnius in Lithuania, the first Bebras challenge involved 3470 students from 146 schools.
- The Bebras Challenge has grown so much that there are now almost 60 countries, with more than 1.6 million students, participating last year alone!
- In case you’re wondering, Bebras is the Lithuanian word for ‘beaver’.
- The International Bebras Community chose this name because beavers endeavour for perfection in their everyday activities. They are known to be hard working and intelligent, so it’s only right that the challenge be named after them.

What are some of the different uses of wethers mentioned in the text
------------correct----------------------
References in periodicals archive ?
Several factors can cause wethers to be more prone to calculi.
In the present study, although bucks had higher final and harvest BW, they failed to produce higher DP when compared to wethers. Differential body tissue growth in bucks and wethers may contribute to higher non-edible body parts that lowered DP in bucks and higher proportion of carcass fat (KPF; p<0.02) in wethers that may have contributed to higher DP in wether goats.
Of these, about 2,200 wethers were slaughtered to provide detailed carcass quality data, and 2,600 ewes are being evaluated for their maternal characteristics.
"Despite wether lambs being back on the year, ewe lambs were up PS6.50.
VICTORY: Teesside's Roger Williams on his way to winning the intermediate class at Wether Hill Farm
You have your commercial ranchers who are raising goats in quantities to take to market, there are people whose sole focus is on breeding animals, and you also have those who sell wethers to the 4-H and FFA exhibitors, not to forget those who do a combination of some or all of these.
The hillside market on the outskirts of Lairg reverberated to enthusiastic bidding for wethers from all the regular lowland buyers as lambs from crofters and farmers from across the country met better-thanexpected prices, although trade for ewe lambs became "pickier" as the day wound to a close and fell short of last year's outstanding sale.
The Scot, still to win a Major, is weighing up wether to use a new putter with a hole in the middle.
A younger or out of condition wether can do about 20% of its body weight.
Newcastle brought in Worrall as a tactical substitute for Wethers in heat seven but it was Etheridge who made the early lead, only for Lasse Bjerre to open the throttle and fly past the Bandit down the back straight in a Diamonds 2-4.
Steve Worrall scored paid 15 that night, Max Clegg also among the points with12 and Matty Wethers battling hard for seven riding against his former club.
A 5-1 for Newcastle by Matthew Wethers and Lasse Bjerre put Newcastle ahead again 28-2

Several factors can cause wethers to be more prone to calculi.
In the present study, although bucks had higher final and harvest BW, they failed to produce higher DP when compared to wethers. Differential body tissue growth in bucks and wethers may contribute to higher non-edible body parts that lowered DP in bucks and higher proportion of carcass fat (KPF; p<0.02) in wethers that may have contributed to higher DP in wether goats.
Of these, about 2,200 wethers were slaughtered to provide detailed carcass quality data, and 2,600 ewes are being evaluated for their maternal characteristics.
"Despite wether lambs being back on the year, ewe lambs were up PS6.50.

What factors should be considered when deciding whether to wait for amber trichomes or to harvest due to falling temperatures
------------correct----------------------
Grew 4 black sugar rose. Took down 2 plants( the light green bud).Left 2,They’re more advanced with yellow leaves, the darker bud shown. I have about 4 hrs of sun when shining , 60 degree days, 40 degree nights. No powdery mildew or bud rot yet. Is it worth waiting for amber trikes or do I yank em. Will they benefit if left, or just stagnate till the frost, like tomatoes. SW ONTARIO
Thanks, I’m working on the magnification.Still wondering about the cold weather stagnation thing though.
@Vader. I’m on the east coast and we’re running into the same thing with colder nites.
Def slows things down growth wise.
I’m not seeing any more new pistils showing in the pics so I’d say you’re close to if not in your harvest window.
You could let them go a bit longer but are you really going to gain that much in a week ?
Tough one. Good luck.
First off I’m in southern Ontario (Branchton), so I know what your going through with the weather. As far as amber goes, from what I hear it’s personal preference. Some prefer all cloudy, some like more amber. If your at risk of losing your crop do to bad weather I’

What did the Eighth Circuit's ruling establish regarding the privacy rights of farmers and ranchers in relation to federal disclosure of information
------------correct----------------------
y. And the good news is that the Eighth Circuit agreed with us—holding that affected farmers and ranchers can assert a privacy interest, so as to prohibit disclosure of sensitive information. Also the mere fact that contested information might otherwise be obtained through an exhaustive search of state and local records does not mean that business owners are without right to object to federal compilation and release of those materials.
In this case, we were specifically worried that the information would be used by activists to harass and intimidate small business ranchers and farmers. But on a more fundamental level, we thought it important to clarify that small business owners—in all industries—have a right under federal law to object to federal agencies releasing information that may invade their own personal privacy interests. In a statement on the heels of the decision
, Karen Harned, Executive Director of the NFIB Small Business Legal Center, said: “The idea that EPA has the authority to release the private home addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of farmers and ranchers is preposterous. The EPA violated the privacy and trust of American farmers and their families. Today, the Court rightly upheld federal privacy laws and protected farmers and ranchers from potentially dangerous exposures.

What information does the author provide about the effectiveness of Nexcare Acne Dressing
------------correct----------------------
The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly
So far this week I've blogged about the wonderful results you can get from sheet masks - The Good
I've also talked about some of the nasty results you can get from sheet masks - The Bad
And now we're going to talk about pimples - The Ugly
On my quest to get rid of those uglies I've come across acne patches. Acne patches are medicated treatments that you put on your pimples.
Here are a few brands I've tried & my opinions...
Warning - The language won't always be pretty!!
Sorry, but I wasn't able to document with pictures how these products work.
I'm going to begin with what I think is the most popular acne patch..
Nexcare Acne Dressing
This is what the box looks like.
Acne Dressing: Hydrocolloid dressing absorbs secretion and promotes healing of acne
The dressing protects acne from dirt and other contaminants
Waterproof and breathable
Clean and dry the skin and hands thoroughly.Remove the film at the back of an acne dressing and cover it on the acne. Fix it tightly by pressing on the rim.Replace when the acne dressing turns white (including full absorption of secretion).The acne dressing should be applied before wearing make-up.
Replace when the acne dressing turns white (indicating full absorption of secretion).If skin becomes red and swollen, or if burning, aching and other forms of irritation occur, cease using and seek medical advice at once.It is normal to find bubbles in the colloid.
One characteristic of Nexcare™ Acne dressing is that it turns white after absorbing the secretion. Replacement should be made once that happens. Check daily the acne's situation. After cleaning and drying, apply a new acne dressing. Even if the acne dressing turns white within a day, it should be replaced. No replacement is needed after the acne is healed.
I really was expecting a great product & this just wasn't it for me. Honestly I had such a hard time getting the patch to stick to my pimple that I don't even know if this product works well. You should use these patches while you sleep, but my patch didn't even make it longer than 2 hours. I heard a few tips as to how to get this to stick to your face, but I really didn't want to apply anything extra to my face. When this product is on your face it is quite noticeable.

Clean and dry the skin and hands thoroughly.Remove the film at the back of an acne dressing and cover it on the acne. Fix it tightly by pressing on the rim.Replace when the acne dressing turns white (including full absorption of secretion).The acne dressing should be applied before wearing make-up.
Replace when the acne dressing turns white (indicating full absorption of secretion).If skin becomes red and swollen, or if burning, aching and other forms of irritation occur, cease using and seek medical advice at once.It is normal to find bubbles in the colloid.
One characteristic of Nexcare™ Acne dressing is that it turns white after absorbing the secretion. Replacement should be made once that happens. Check daily the acne's situation. After cleaning and drying, apply a new acne dressing. Even if the acne dressing turns white within a day, it should be replaced. No replacement is needed after the acne is healed.
I really was expecting a great product & this just wasn't it for me. Honestly I had such a hard time getting the patch to stick to my pimple that I don't even know if this product works well. You should use these patches while you sleep, but my patch didn't even make it longer than 2 hours. I heard a few tips as to how to get this to stick to your face, but I really didn't want to apply anything extra to my face. When this product is on your face it is quite noticeable.

tional Thinking Challenge
Congratulations to the following Year 3-12 students who received awards in the Bebras Computational Thinking Challenge, which was held at the College last month.
The winning house will be presented with the trophy at the next whole school assembly.
Fun facts about the Bebras Computational Thinking Challenge
- The Bebras Australia Computational Thinking Challenge started in Australia in 2014 through the CSIRO Education & Outreach program, Digital Careers. However, the Bebras Challenge has a long and world-wide history.
- Founded in 2004 by Professor Valentina Dagiene from University of Vilnius in Lithuania, the first Bebras challenge involved 3470 students from 146 schools.
- The Bebras Challenge has grown so much that there are now almost 60 countries, with more than 1.6 million students, participating last year alone!
- In case you’re wondering, Bebras is the Lithuanian word for ‘beaver’.
- The International Bebras Community chose this name because beavers endeavour for perfection in their everyday activities. They are known to be hard working and intelligent, so it’s only right that the challenge be named after them.
To find out more, please visit the website: https://www.bebras.edu.au/about-bebras/
Progressive Achievement Testing
This term, students in Year 1-9 will be participating in online Progressive Achievement Testing (PAT) online.
The test, which will take place during students’ normal class sessions, is used in thousands of schools in Australia and around the world.
The approach focuses on assessing and monitoring student growth over time and is underpinned by an understanding that students of the same age and in the same year of school can be at very different points in their learning and development.
Why do schools use PAT tests?
- They can be used to inform teaching and learning and to assist in planning effective and targeted learning programs.
- They provide a measure of student achievement in each learning area.
- There is a common achievement scale for all tests within a learning area (PAT scale scores allow teachers to compare achievement on the tests within each learning area regardless of year level and the specific test completed and to monitor progress over time).
- They are mapped to the Australian Curriculum.
- They provide overall descriptions of the types of skills mastered and those still to be developed based on test performance.
- Individual and group reports have automatically calculated scores and sorting functions that allow comparison of scores across students, strands, etc.
If you have any queries or concerns about your child’s participation in PAT at St Mary’s College, please contact Michelle Baker at email@example.com

Junior School mural in the making
Local artist Tom O’Hern has created a bit of a stir at the College this week.
The reason? He has started work on a mural in the Junior School line-up area, which will be completed during the school term.
Inspired by the names of our Junior School classes, the painting will feature native Australian flora and fauna, such as wallabies, wombats, bluegum and wattle.
Students and staff are looking forward to witnessing the piece evolve over the coming weeks!

A big thank you to all families and staff who generously supported our Giant Trailer Hamper Raffle fundraising initiative this morning, and those who have volunteered to contribute to the ‘Cake and Make Stall’ – we’re looking forward to sampling your baked goodies.

While we are at the pointy end of preparations, last-minute helpers are still urgently needed, particularly to man the inflatable stalls (Zorb balls, jumping castle, etc).
We are also still welcoming donations for the chocolate wheel. Donations can include electrical items, hardware items, sports equipment, toys and vouchers.

What motivations do participants in the #FastforLife initiative have for fasting and praying
------------correct----------------------
Today, Relevant Radio is joined by over 5,700 individuals and families who signed up to participate in the #FastforLife. This initiative is an observance of prayer and fasting in solidarity with the March for Life and Pro-life movement.
For those who can’t attend the events today in Washington D.C., Fast for Life has become a way to participate in the Pro-life movement from wherever they are. Of the 5,700, there are participants from all 50 states and from 21 countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Croatia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, The Netherlands, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States of America, and Vietnam! How beautiful that support for the most vulnerable members of society—the unborn, elderly, sick or disabled, etc.—truly spans the globe.
If you’d like to join us, it’s not too late! You will find more information and a form to sign up here: relevantradio.com/fast
Here are just a few of the participants and how they’re observing #FastforLife today:
Woody from California: My three girls and I are going to fast all day and pray. They are 14 ,16, 18 and want to do this. It will be the first time for all of us to just run on water but we are excited to be part of such a great cause.
Melanie from Phoenix, AZ: I wish I could be in the March…..I will be fasting today and do a family rosary tonight after school and work.
Harry and Dottie D from PA: We’ll be fasting and praying today for all the marchers and for the success of all your efforts to end abortion.
Matthew from Chicago: My niece and nephew are heading to D.C. for the March. I’m going to support them and the cause by saying a rosary and fasting from meat tomorrow. God bless everyone participating.
Nate from NJ: I am going to fast (one small meal, one regular meal) and offer up my day, any stress, works, joys, good deeds for the end of abortion. God Bless and thank you, Relevant Radio.
Kevin from Minneapolis, MN: Total fast… just liquids.
Mary Pat from Utah: I will be fasting tomorrow while my daughter marches at the March for Life in D.C. as part of a group of Georgetown students. I thank Relevant Radio for your commitment to protecting the dignity of human life.
Lucy from Wisconsin: I am pregnant with my second child and have been suffering from pretty debilitating anxiety during this pregnancy. Housework has been particularly debilitating for me so I am going to clear the surfaces in my house and fold the laundry as an offering for the cause for life and the marchers.
Tessa from Iowa: Fasting from social media, Netflix and fast food! #forthebabies
Katie from TX: I will be abstaining from meat, sweets, and carbonated drinks.
Nick: I will be flying for the Army, which usually means I miss lunch, but I will also bring my prayers on mission with us. St. Michael pray for justice, St. Francis of Assisi pray for peace, St. Maximilian Kolbe pray for hope! Sacred Heart of Jesus have mercy on us!
Susanne from Augusta, Maine: I will fast and pray. Depending on expected snowy weather I will hopefully be able to attend morning Mass.

he jury defining "harboring" as meaning "any conduct tending to substantially facilitate an alien's remaining in the United States illegally." Appellant urges that this instruction is too broad, in that a proper definition should be limited both to actions comprising a part of the successive stages of the smuggling process, and to the provision of shelter or services. As stated above, we reject appellant's contention that subparagraph (3) is limited to activities which constitute a part of the successive stages of the smuggling process. The definition given in the charge comes from the opinions in Cantu, Varkonyi, and Lopez.
In this case the trial court also carefully instructed the jury concerning the employment proviso of section 1324(a) as well as the requirement that appellant not only knew that the alien named in each respective count of the indictment was in fact unlawfully in this country, but that also appellant's concealing, harboring or shielding from detection of such alien, or attempting to do so, was done "willfully or knowingly." In this connection, "knowingly" was defined as "voluntarily and intentionally and not because of a mistake or other innocent reason" and "willfully" was defined as "voluntarily and purposely with the specific intent to do something that the law forbids-that is to say, with a bad purpose either to disobey or to disregard the law." None of these instructions were in any way objected to.
Under the wording of the indictment and the evidence the only matter presented for the jury's consideration was whether Correa and Torres were illegal aliens, whether appellant knew this on the occasion in question, whether he warned them of the presence of the immigration officers under the circumstances testified to by the various witnesses, his state of mind in so doing, and whether such conduct and state of mind on his part amounted to a violation of subparagraph (3) of section 1324(a). The trial court's instructions adequately presented all these questions to the jury. The jury was not allowed to find appellant guilty on the basis of any conduct or any state of mind that would not constitute a violation of subparagraph (3). Under these circumstances, it matters not whether the particular conduct and state of mind at issue be labeled "harboring" or "concealing" or "shielding from detection," for each are equally violative of subparagraph (3). The trial court adequately instructed the jury on what was necessary to convict under section 1324(a)(3) and did not allow the jury to convict on the basis of any conduct not alleged in the indictment and shown in the evidence, or which would not constitute a violation of section 1324(a)(3). The instruction complained of does not present reversible error.5
Appellant's remaining contention is that the court erred in admitting the records showing his prior illegal entries into the United States in 1971 and 1972. No complaint was made at trial, nor is any made here, about the authentication of these records or the method of proof of the matters reflected thereby. Rather, appellant's complaint is that the facts shown were irrelevant and prejudicial, because they were remote in time, did not involve criminal acts, and did not involve acts that were similar to those charged in the instant case. We disagree.
We hold that these records were properly admitted for the limited purpose of showing appellant's knowledge and state of mind, which are clearly elements of the offense charged in each count. We note in passing that the trial court carefully considered the admissibility of these records in a hearing outside the presence of the jury, and concluded that the probative value of this evidence to show appellant's knowledge and state of mind was not outweighed by the dangers of unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, or misleading of the jury. The court carefully instructed the jury when the evidence was admitted, and again in the final charge, that they could consider the evidence only if they first determined, independent of it, that appellant did the acts charged. Even then they could consider the evidence only insofar as it reflected on appellant's knowledge and state of mind on the occasion charged in the indictment. Appellant did not, and does not, complain of these instructions. Indeed, appellant's counsel was specifically asked whether he desired any further instructions in this regard, and he said he did not.
Under Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, "(e)vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts (may be admitted) ... as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident." (Emphasis added.) Under Rule 403 relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of issues or misleading of the jury. Plainly, the trial court properly appraised the issue of the admissibility of this evidence, and the limited purposes for which it could be considered, in accordance with Rules 403 and 404 and the decision of this Court in United States v. Beechum, 582 F.2d 898 (5th Cir. 1978) (en banc), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 920, 99 S.Ct. 1244, 59 L.Ed.2d 472 (1979). In these circumstances the decision to admit the evidence can be disturbed only for an abuse of discretion. United States v. Benton, 637 F.2d 1052, 1056 (5th Cir. 1981). No abuse of discretion is shown here.
The fact that the records did not show that appellant's prior conduct was criminal is immaterial. Rule 404(b) authorizes the admission of prior "acts" as well as "crimes" and "wrongs." Although one of the prior acts occurred slightly more than ten years prior to trial, and was hence outside the time limit provided for in Fed.R.Evid. 609(b), evidence admitted under Rule 404(b) is not controlled by the ten-year limit specified in Rule 609(b), which applies to the quite different matter of admitting evidence of prior convictions to impeach a witness. Of course, if the prior crimes or acts admitted under Rule 404(b) are too remote in time, this may substantially weaken their probative value and hence weigh in favor of their exclusion under Rule 403.
The evidence here was particularly relevant to show appellant's knowledge concerning the practices and procedures of immigration officers and the required documentation for alien workers. We observe that to the extent such prior acts are relevant to the matter of knowledge, rather than being relevant only to intent, remoteness may be less of a factor in determining the probative value of the evidence. The passage of time and changing circumstances are more likely to significantly change one's intent than they are to obliterate knowledge once gained.
We also note that prior to the offer of this evidence by the government, appellant had cross-examined the agents Garcia, Vasquez and Marroquin in an effort to show the numerous circumstances under which one not a citizen of the United States might be legally working in this country, including the case of an alien married to a United States citizen. The appellant was obviously seeking to show that he would not necessarily realize that Correa and Torres were illegal aliens, even though he might realize that they were not United States citizens. Accordingly, appellant's prior experience with the INS and the requirements applicable to alien workers, and particularly the orders for his own deportation notwithstanding his claimed marriage to an American citizen, were especially relevant.6 The evidence was also relevant to appellant's knowledge of the procedures followed by the immigration officers in apprehending and deporting aliens. It tended to show that appellant's purpose in advising Correa and Torres of the presence of the immigration officers was not, as appellant's counsel contended in arguing his motion for instructed verdict, "entirely innocent" or simply the equivalent of "the fire department is here," but was instead an attemp

674 F.2d 1067
10 Fed. R. Evid. Serv. 697
UNITED STATES of America, Plaintiff-Appellee,
Angel RUBIO-GONZALEZ, Defendant-Appellant.
United States Court of Appeals,
May 6, 1982.
Nicasio Dimas, Jr., San Antonio, Tex., for defendant-appellant.
Sidney Powell, Asst. U. S. Atty., San Antonio, Tex., for plaintiff-appellee.
Appeal from the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas.
Before RUBIN, SAM D. JOHNSON and GARWOOD, Circuit Judges.
GARWOOD, Circuit Judge:
Appellant Rubio-Gonzalez appeals his conviction, following a jury trial, on both counts of a two-count indictment charging violations of 8 U.S.C.A. § 1324(a)(3).1 The first count charged that on or about June 29, 1981, in Helotes, Texas, at D & B Materials Company, appellant, willfully and knowingly, did, and did attempt to, conceal, harbor and shield from detection Rodolfo Correa-Anaya, who, as appellant then knew, was an alien not duly admitted nor lawfully entitled to enter and reside in the United States. The second count was a duplication of the first except that it related to a different illegal alien, Felipe Torres-Cruz.
The evidence tended to show the following.2 Acting on information received by their San Antonio office, four Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) criminal investigators went to the D & B Materials Company premises in Helotes, Texas, on June 29, 1981, at approximately 1:30 p. m. to determine if illegal aliens were employed there. Investigators Marroquin and Osborn drove an unmarked car bearing government license plates, and investigators Garcia and Vasquez drove an unmarked van having government license plates and containing a wire cage-like panel separating the driver's seat from the rest of the van. When the agents arrived at D & B Materials Company, they stopped both vehicles at a trailer that appeared to be the office. Garcia went inside to advise that the agents were there and to ask permission to check the employees to determine if they were aliens illegally in the United States. Vasquez waited outside for Garcia to return; Osborn and Marroquin remained in their car.
While waiting outside the trailer, Vasquez saw a man, later identified as the appellant, Angel Rubio-Gonzalez, arrive on a motorcycle and go in the trailer. Garcia also saw Rubio-Gonzalez enter the trailer, talk to one of the secretaries, and leave. When appellant came out of the trailer, Vasquez started talking to him about his motorcycle. During the conversation the agent determined that Rubio-Gonzalez was an employee, so he identified himself, displayed his badge and asked to see appellant's identification. Appellant produced documentation showing he was a resident alien.3
While waiting for Garcia to come out of the trailer, Marroquin and Osborn drove around the work area to see if there was another office. They saw several people working near a rock crusher, and parked and watched them at a distance for a few minutes, then drove back toward the trailer. As they neared the trailer, they observed Vasquez talking to appellant, who appeared to be putting his wallet back in his pocket and who thereafter got on his motorcycle and started driving toward the work area. When Marroquin and Osborn arrived, Vasquez told them appellant was an employee and a lawful resident alien. Marroquin and Osborn then decided to follow appellant, turned their car around, and followed approximately 100 yards behind him as he rode his motorcycle toward the work area. Appellant drove to the bottom of the gravel mound near the rock crusher where two men, later identified as Correa-Anaya (Correa) and Torres-Cruz (Torres), were working, dropped his motorcycle and ran up the hill toward them. The agents observed him gesturing and apparently pointing in the agents' direction, whereupon the workers immediately dropped their tools and ran. The distance was too great for the agents to hear whether anything was said, but Correa and Torres testified that appellant said, in Spanish, "immigration" or "immigration is here." The agents then drove around the mound of gravel and caught Correa and Torres, and a third alien who had been in the vicinity, attempting to escape. Two other illegal aliens were apprehended running in various directions from the general area of the rock crusher. While the investigators were chasing the aliens, appellant got back on his motorcycle and drove toward the exit, but Marroquin stopped him.
The five aliens were put in the van. They asked that they be allowed to obtain their personal belongings, and directed the agents to the "barracks" where they had been living on the property. As the agents approached this building, two aliens ran out of it. The agents chased these men, but caught only one, appellant's brother. Each of the six aliens apprehended admitted that he was in the country illegally and had no claim to United States citizenship.
Correa and Torres each testified that he was born in Mexico and that he and his parents were Mexican citizens, that neither he nor his parents were United States citizens or had been legally admitted into the United States, and that on the occasion in question he was not legally in this country. Each was present in the country on this occasion by virtue of an illegal entry, and each had entered the United States by walking or swimming across the Rio Grande near Piedras Negras. Upon crossing, each had traveled first to Spofford and then directly to Helotes, where they had been working ever since at the D & B Materials Company plant. Correa arrived in October 1980, Torres in late April 1981. While at the D & B Materials Company plant they spoke Spanish exclusively. Though another party was apparently the owner, each knew appellant as the foreman or "boss," and each had talked to him from time to time since their arrival, always in Spanish. Each was from the Mexican State of Guanajuato, Correa's hometown being Jerecauro, and Torres' being Aposeo El Grande. Correa testified he did not talk with appellant about his or appellant's hometown or state or his status in the United States. Torres' testimony did not reflect whether these subjects were mentioned when he talked with appellant. Each testified they knew appellant's brother while at the D & B Materials Company. Torres answered "yes" when asked "was he also an alien, like you." Correa said he knew the brother's hometown but did not know if he was illegally in the country. Correa and Torres testified that approximately ten illegal aliens were working at the plant at the time of their apprehension. Each testified that prior to appellant's warning to them they were unaware of the presence of the immigration officers, and that they ran in an attempt to escape from the immigration officers.
Immigration records indicated appellant had been ordered deported as an illegal alien in April 1971, and March 1972, that on the former occasion he asserted he had made three prior entries into the United States, that his parents were Mexican citizens, as was he, and that his hometown was Aposeo El Grande, in the state of Guanajuato, Mexico. These records showed he had previously illegally entered by wading across the river near Eagle Pass. The records concerning his prior deportations also showed that he claimed to be married to an American citizen who was petitioning on his behalf for him to be granted resident alien status, although he admitted also being, or having been, married to another woman in Guanajuato.
Appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction on several grounds.
He first contends that there is no evidence that his conduct formed any part of the process, chain of events or successive stages of smuggling the aliens into the United States. While appellant accurately characterizes the evidence as failing to show that he was in any way connected with the smuggling process, nevertheless we have held that section 1324(a)(3) is not so limited.

------------correct----------------------
h the situation, who were allegedly threatened by the driver of the car involved in the tragedy.
Without prejudice to the case, the MHRA said it was seriously concerned about what appeared to be an increase in substance abuse-related violence and accidents in our community. Drugs are the bane of a healthy society and economy and must be tackled with the highest sense of urgency by the relevant authorities to avoid drug epidemics. The MHRA believes that there are enough indicators to merit a national debate to raise awareness of the issue and significantly increase action to curb society-wide use of illicit drugs, which can be one of the leading causes of mental health problems and all their negative effects.
To this end, the MHRA has called upon the MCESD Council to discuss this issue as a matter of urgency and accordingly form a joint opinion for consideration by the government
