These are defined to be those contracts in which the terms of the agreement are fully and openly incorporated at the time the contract is entered into, while implied contracts are such as arise by legal inference and upon principles of reason and justice from certain facts, or where there is circumstantial evidence showing that the parties intended to make a contract. 2 Bl. Com. 443. As contracts for subscription to stock contain no stipulation with reference to the rights of creditors and depositors, it is clear that such rights can only be asserted upon the theory that the subscriber impliedly bound himself to respond to any liability arising indirectly from his contract of subscription.
Whether the promise raised by the statute was an implied contract not in writing or a liability created by statute, it is immaterial to inquire. For the purposes of this case it may have been both. The statute was the origin both of the right and the remedy, but the contract was the origin of the personal responsibility of the defendant. Did the statute make a distinction between them with reference to the time within which an action must be brought, it might be necessary to make a more exact definition; but as the action must be brought in any case within four years, it is unnecessary to go farther than to declare what seems entirely clear to us, that it is not a contract in writing within the meaning of § 10 of the Nebraska act. Hawkins v. Iron Valley Furnace Co. 40 Ohio St. 507.
Plaintiff, however, insists that defendant's contract here sought to be enforced was not entered into between him and the bank, but between him and the creditors of the bank; that the order of the Comptroller of the Currency for the assessment of the shareholders did not create a cause of action or set the statute of limitations running, nor in any way affect the validity or duration of the right which belongs to the creditors to have this liability enforced; and that the action not being upon the contract of subscription, but upon the contract of the shareholder with the creditors of the bank, entered into by himself with the creditors through the agency of the officers of the bank, different considerations apply, and the statute of limitations does not operate as a bar so long as there are any outstanding claims against the bank.
In support of this proposition we are referred to § 2 of the act of June 30, 1876 (19 Stat. at L. 63, chap. 156), which declares 'that when any national banking association shall have gone into liquidation under the provisions of § 5220 of said Revised Statutes, the individual liability of the shareholders provided for by § 5151 of said Statutes may be enforced by any creditor of such association, by bill in equity in the nature of a creditors' bill, brought by such creditor on behalf of himself and of all other creditors of the association against the shareholders thereof,' etc.; and we are cited to several cases holding that claims against shareholders under similar statutes do not become barred until the expiration of the time at which the claims against the corporation also became barred.
There are several answers to this position. Section 5220, to which the 2d section of the act of June 30, 1876, is supplementary, contemplates only a voluntary liquidation, providing, as it does, that 'any association may go into liquidation and be closed by the vote of its shareholders owning two thirds of its stock.' Richmond v. Irons, 121 U. S. 27, 47, 30 L. ed. 864, 870, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 788, 797. Now, the Capital National Bank did not go into voluntary liquidation, but, as averred in the bill, 'the Comptroller of the Currency of the United States became and was satisfied of the insolvency of the said Capital National Banking Association,' and thereupon appointed a receiver. In other words, the proceedings were taken under § 5234 as supplemented by § 1 of the act of June 30, 1876, authorizing the Comptroller of the Currency to appoint a receiver when the association had refused to pay its circulating notes and is in default, or he is otherwise satisfied of its insolvency.
But it is also sufficient to say of this that the action is not brought by the creditors under the 2d section of the act of June 30, 1876, but by the receiver under Rev. Stat. § 5234. In such cases no debt becomes due to the receiver as such until a deficiency has been ascertained and an assessment made, when the statute begins to run. Scovill v. Thayer, 105 U. S. 145, 26 L. ed. 968; Hawkins v. Glenn, 131 U. S. 319, 33 L. ed. 184, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 739. Upon the theory of the plaintiff, if the statute of limitations were pleaded, it would become necessary for the receiver to show that there were outstanding claims against the bank which were not barred by the statute, and therefore that the bill might be maintained. This would involve a departure from the whole theory of the bill in this case, which is based upon the allegation that the Comptroller of the Currency made an assessment upon the stockholders June 10, 1893, payable July 10, from which latter date plaintiff claimed interest. Defendant demurred to this upon the ground that the bill set forth a cause of action barred by the statute, and plaintiff went to a hearing upon this demurrer and was defeated. Obviously he cannot now set up a right to recover, if the creditors had brought a bill under another statute, to which no allusion is made in the bill in this case, and which provides for a wholly separate and independent remedy.
Plaintiff's final contention, that no cause of action arises until a demand has been made, is also fully met by the allegation of the bill that on June 10, 1893, the Comptroller of the Currency made an order in which he declared that he had made an assessment and requisition upon the shareholders, 'and that he did thereby make demand upon each and every share of the capital stock of the said association,' and directed the receiver to take proceedings by suit to enforce the individual liability of the shareholders. Having made this allegation himself, we do not understand upon what theory the plaintiff now assumes that no demand was made.
In the view we take of the statute of limitations, we have not thought it worth while to consider the points made by the defendant, that the action should have been at law, and that the bill is defective for the want of proper parties.
There was no error in the decree of the court below, and it is therefore affirmed.

What challenges are identified regarding the future of Turkey and Mesopotamia after peace is restored
------------correct----------------------
Now they have reformed at a point, only twenty miles from ——, their present base. We shall go for them there no doubt, and push them back once more. But what does it all lead to? Imagine peace restored. What will Turkey be like? She will be bankrupt, chaotic, totally incapable of keeping order among these murderous Bedouins. The country would be a second Persia under her. Persia is intolerable enough for the Europeans who trade there at present: but the plight of this country might easily be worse. We are bound to control the bit from Basra to the sea to protect existing interests. The whole future of that area—as of all Mesopotamia—depends on a scientific scheme of drainage and irrigation. At present half the country is marsh and half desert. Why? Because under Turkish rule the river is never dredged, the banks are never repaired, stray Arabs can cut haphazard canals and leave them to form marshes, and so on. Now an irrigation and drainage scheme is vitally necessary, but (1) it involves a large outlay; (2) to be effective it must start a long way up-stream; (3) there must be security for the good government not only of the area included in the scheme, but of the whole course of the river above it. These Asiatic rivers are tricky things: they run for hundreds of miles through alluvial plains which are as flat as your hand. Here at Amarah, 200 miles from the mouth of the Tigris,

JOHN W. McDONALD, Receiver, etc., v. DAVID E. THOMPSON.
184 U.S. 71 (22 S.Ct. 297, 46 L.Ed. 437)
JOHN W. McDONALD, Receiver, etc., Appt. v. DAVID E. THOMPSON.
Argued: January 13, 14, 1902.
Decided: February 3, 1902.
- opinion, Brown [HTML]
This was a bill in equity originally filed May 20, 1898, in the circuit court for the district of Nebraska, by Kent K. Hayden, receiver of the Capital National Bank of Lincoln, Nebraska (of whom the present appelant is the successor in office), against David E. Thompson, to recover defendant's proportion of an assessment upon the stockholders of the bank to the amount of the par value of their shares. The bank failed on January 23, 1893, and a receiver was shortly thereafter appointed. On June 10, 1893, the Comptroller of the Currency ordered the assessment, which was made payable July 10, 1893.
The bill alleged Thompson to have been the owner of 210 shares of the capital stock, which he had acquired upon subscription to such stock and as a part of the original issue; that he, knowing the bank to be in a failing condition and practically insolvent, and in anticipation of its approaching failure, had sold and caused such stock to be transferred to certain irresponsible parties, and that such transfer was made with intent to defraud the bank, its depositors and creditors.
Defendant demurred upon the ground that it appeared by the bill that the cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations. The demurrer was sustained, the bill amended, another demurrer interposed and sustained, and the bill dismissed. An appeal was taken to the circuit court of appeals, which affirmed the judgment of the circuit court.
Messrs. J. R. Webster, John H. Ames, and Andrew E. Harvey for appellant.
Messrs. Halleck F. Rose and C. E. Magoon for appellee.
Mr. Justice Brown delivered the opinion of the court:
This bill is founded upon Rev. Stat. § 5151, which declares that 'the shareholders of every national banking association shall be held individually responsible, equally and ratably, and not one for another, for all contracts, debts, and engagements of such association, to the extent of the amount of their stock therein at the par value thereof, in addition to the amount invested in such shares,' etc. By § 5234 the Comptroller of the Currency is authorized to appoint a receiver of insolvent banks, who 'may, if necessary to pay the debts of such association, enforce the individual liability of the stockholders.'
The case turns upon the applicability of the state statute of limitations, which, so far as it is material, reads as follows:
'Sec. 5. Civil actions can only be commenced within the time prescribed in this title after the cause of action shall have accrued.
'Sec. 10. Within five years, an action upon a specialty, or any agreement, contract, or promise in writing, or foreign judgment.
'Sec. 11. Within four years, an action upon a contract not in writing, express or implied; an action upon a liability created by statute other than a forfeiture or penalty.'
As the cause of action in this case accrued on July 10, 1893, when the assessment was made payable (Hawkins v. Glenn, 131 U. S. 319, 33 L. ed. 184, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 739; Glenn v. Marbury, 145 U. S. 499, 36 L. ed. 790, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 914; Thompson v. German Ins. Co. 76 Fed. 892; Van Pelt v. Gardner, 54 Neb. 701, 74 N. W. 1083, 75 N. W. 874), and the action was begun on May 20, 1898, more than four but less than five years thereafter, the case really turns upon the question whether the action is upon a 'contract or promise in writing,' or 'upon a contract not in writing, express or implied,' or 'upon a liability created by statute.' If the cause of action be upon a written contract, the action was brought in time. If upon a contract not in writing, or a statutory liability, the statute of limitations is a complete bar.
Used in this connection and as distinguished from a contract not in writing, express or implied, we think it entirely clear that § 10 contemplates an action between the immediate parties or their privies to a written contract, and that the only contract covered by that definition in this case is the one arising from the allegation of the bill that Thompson was the owner of 210 shares of the original capital stock, and 'that he acquired the same upon subscription to such capital stock,' and by a receipt of certificates for such shares. The only contract to be gathered from this allegation is one between the bank on the one hand and the defendant on the other, by which the latter agreed to take and pay for a certain number of shares, and the former agreed to issue certificates to him for the same. Had the action been brought upon this contract,as, for instance, by the bank to recover an unpaid assessment upon the original shares,the case would have fallen within § 10, and the suit might have been brought within five years.
But there was no contract in writing with the creditors or depositors of the bank, and none with the bank itself, to which the receiver could be said to be a privy, except to pay for the stock as originally issued. Granting there was a contract with the creditors to pay a sum equal to the value of the stock taken, in addition to the sum invested in the shares, this was a contract created by the statute, and obligatory upon the stockholders by reason of the statute existing at the time of their subscription; but it was not a contract in writing within the meaning of the Nebraska act, since the writingthat is, the subscription contained no reference whatever to the statutory obligation and no promise to respond beyond the amount of the subscription. In none of the numerous cases upon the subject in this court is this obligation treated as an express contract, but as one created by the statute and implied from the express contract of the stockholders to take and pay for shares in the association. Carrol v. Green, 92 U. S. 509, 512, 23 L. ed. 738, 739; Terry v. Little, 101 U. S. 216, 25 L. ed. 864; First Nat. Bank v. Hawkins, 174 U. S. 364, 43 L. ed. 1007, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 739; Matteson v. Dent, 176 U. S. 521, 44 L. ed. 571, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 419; Whitman v. National Bank, 176 U. S. 559, 44 L. ed. 587, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 477.
While § 10 does not use the words 'express contract,' but the words 'contract or promise in writing,' we think that, taken in connection with § 11, which is confined to contracts not in writing, express or implied, express contracts are primarily and principally intended by the earlier section.

On some occasions there will be forced passing places in the road, this could be
for various reasons such as road works or to slow traffic down in that particular
road. You will normally see a road sign which will tell you in good time of an approaching
meeting situation, take a look at the following signs and their meanings so you
are prepared the next time you see them:
Figure 1: Various traffic signs that warn you of a narrowing of the road or forced
The road you are driving on might have a placed obstruction which will give you
priority over oncoming traffic or make you give way to oncoming vehicles, an example
of this is shown in figure 2 below:
Figure 2: Obstruction in road with forced priority
Passing a larger vehicle
Sometimes you might be forced to pass a larger vehicle and will have to use the
oncoming traffics lane to do so, there are a few things you need to remember if
you are going to pass a larger vehicle. Always leave a bigger gap when directly
following a larger vehicle, due to their sheer size you want to have a wider view
of what is in front of you if they stop and whether or not you can pass them, and
therefore being further back will widen your view. This is especially useful when
being behind a bus, they will stop quite frequently and you’ll need to keep an eye
out for passengers walking out from behind/in front of a bus, make sure you check
well ahead before you decide to pass a bus because any oncoming vehicles shouldn’t
be forced to slow down for you. Again, make sure you check your mirrors and indicate
right before you pass a stopped bus if anyone can benefit from your indication.
Check out the following video showing how to correctly pass a bus that has stopped:
Typical meeting/passing situations
There are a variety of typical everyday meeting/passing situations which you may come across, the more situations you come across will improve how you will deal with the next meeting/passing situation that arises. Have a look at the video below which shows a narrow residential road where meeting situations will almost certainly arise. Take special notice of how we have planned ahead to anticipate an oncoming vehicle.
FINELINES guide to dealing with meeting, passing and adequate clearance
Our end of tutorial guide will brush up everything we’ve gone over in this section,
don’t depend on this part alone however, have a read through the whole section and
watch the videos if you haven’t already. The only way to master this aspect of everyday
driving is to practise as many meeting/passing scenarios as possible because a lot
of your own judgement is needed in these situations. We at Fineline Driving Academy
always make sure our learners get extensive practise with passing/meeting situations
to make sure they are well prepared for their driving future. Here are the main
points that can be learned from this particular tutorial:
1) Plan well ahead to decide whether the road you are on narrows and realise if
a meeting situation is approaching.
2) Look out for road signs that tell you if the road narrows, or if priority is
given to yourself or oncoming vehicles.
3) If you are approaching the narrowing point of the road before the approaching
vehicle you should probably pass with the other vehicle holding back, if they reach
it first then you should hold back.
4) Try to leave at least a 2 car length gap between yourself and any parked vehicle
you wait behind.
5) Make sure you check your centre and right mirrors before continuing to make sure
nobody behind you is overtaking.
6) Steer quite sharply to clear the parked vehicle and leave a car doors width between
your car and the parked vehicle (if possible).
7) Keep further back behind a larger vehicle to widen your view, if you pass a pulled
over bus then look out for passengers walking out from behind/in front of the bus.
8) Only indicate as you pass a parked vehicle if someone will benefit, make sure
to cancel the indicator if you do indicate to prevent misleading other road users.
9) Judge each situation individually depending on what is going on at the time,
take every surrounding factor into account because there are many different types
of meeting/passing situations you can come across every day.

OxiClean vs. Clorox OxiMagic
The OxiClean brand of stain removal products, marketed by product conglomerate Church & Dwight, includes a number of laundry, carpet, baby and outdoor cleaning products marketed via direct response TV, online and at retail.
The OxiClean brand was the brainchild of the Appel Family, who had made Orange Glo a famous household product. OxiClean, pitched by the now legendary Billy Mays, became a giant DRTV hit in 2001, eventually transitioning to retail before the family sold Orange Glo Intl., to Church & Dwight in 2006 for $325 million.
Though the OxiClean line is now a retail giant, DRTV ads now often direct consumers to the OxiClean Web site (www.oxiclean.com) for purchase, as well as for special coupon offers to purchase at retail outlets. DRTV-to-online couponing became a popular way for major household product marketers (think Procter & Gamble, Clorox and others) to test DRTV as a new marketing method in the earlier part of this decade. Now, a true DRTV stalwart uses the same tactics.

What are the three stories mentioned in the text segment and what distinctions does the author make about them
------------correct----------------------
lassic Marvel adventure story coupled with a human element, as Jean Grey's sister starts to come to terms with the death of her sister. The story also gives us more of Jean's origin in a way that still gives me the willies.
Next is "Winter Carnival" featuring Iceman. One of my favorites, George Perez, penciled this fun romp at Dartmouth. The thing that still holds true for me today is that it is an Iceman story that is actually pretty good. Bobby Drake was a character I really didn't think much about (His portrayal on "Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends" was sort of my template for him!) and this story brought him out into the spotlight very nicely.
Last is "Show Me The Way To Go Home" featuring my favorite X-Man, Nightcrawler. It is a silly little romp where he and another teleporter end up in a land where men are a rare commodity.
Three great stories, told in Black and White, that I have owned FOREVER.
However, I still prefer my comics in color

What are the concerns mentioned about the changes in the Euphrates river and its impact on Lower Mesopotamia
------------correct----------------------
we are only 28ft. above sea-level. Consequently the river’s course is very easily altered. Look at Stanford’s map of this region and see how the Euphrates has lost itself between Nasiriyah and Basra—“old channel,” “new channel,” creeks, marshes, lakes, flood-areas and so on; the place is a nightmare. That kind of thing is liable to happen anywhere if the river is neglected. So that our schemes for Lower Mesopotamia might be spoilt by the indolence of those in possession higher up the river: let alone the security of the trade-routes which would be at the mercy of wild Arabs if Turkey collapses.
All this inclines me more and more to believe that we shall be forced, sooner or later, to occupy the whole Mesopotamian plain as far as Mosul or to whatever point is the southern limit of Russian control. At first I favoured a “neutral zone” from Mosul to Kut, and I shouldn’t be surprised if that plan still finds favour at home. But frankly I see no prospect of a strong enough Government to make the neutral zone workable; on the contrary everything points to the absorption of the Persian neutral zone by either us or Russia, probably us.
I am still a Captain, but no longer a Coy. Commander. A large draft from India has arrived, 11 officers and 319 men from 1/4th and 2/4th, invalids returned. I am now second in command of a Coy. of respectable size.

But frankly I see no prospect of a strong enough Government to make the neutral zone workable; on the contrary everything points to the absorption of the Persian neutral zone by either us or Russia, probably us.
I am still a Captain, but no longer a Coy. Commander. A large draft from India has arrived, 11 officers and 319 men from 1/4th and 2/4th, invalids returned. I am now second in command of a Coy. of respectable size.

lassic Marvel adventure story coupled with a human element, as Jean Grey's sister starts to come to terms with the death of her sister. The story also gives us more of Jean's origin in a way that still gives me the willies.
Next is "Winter Carnival" featuring Iceman. One of my favorites, George Perez, penciled this fun romp at Dartmouth. The thing that still holds true for me today is that it is an Iceman story that is actually pretty good. Bobby Drake was a character I really didn't think much about (His portrayal on "Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends" was sort of my template for him!) and this story brought him out into the spotlight very nicely.
Last is "Show Me The Way To Go Home" featuring my favorite X-Man, Nightcrawler. It is a silly little romp where he and another teleporter end up in a land where men are a rare commodity.
Three great stories, told in Black and White, that I have owned FOREVER.
However, I still prefer my comics in color

at all and how I have always operated, you would understand my reluctance – at first – in understanding what God was telling me to do. I have never in all my life left a place of employment, without having something lined up to go to next.
I have always been very practical in that way. Always have had a backup plan; not this. time.
This time, I am trusting God to lead me where He wants me to go. I believe He is calling me into using my gifts of words to minister to others. So, with that being said, I am currently working on a book to encourage others and offer hope. I will continue to write this blog, not just to share Jesus with others, but because I feel this is a small part of His plan for me.
The end of this week will signify the end of one long chapter in my life and the beginning of a new one. As always, I can’t wait to see where God leads me!
May you be blessed and know the God Loves You–right where you are! Much love

"To call the Yankees and the Red Sox, two of the best teams in baseball, 'pathetic' and 'embarrassing,' that's just ridiculous," Pedroia told ESPN.com on Friday. "If he doesn't want to do Red Sox and Yankee games, he should tell the umpires' union. Then when we're in the World Series, he'll be out of that assignment, too."
Joe West complained after the conclusion of the Boston-New York series earlier this week that the games are running too long. The umpire has been in the major leagues for 32 years and has worked over 4,000 games.
"They're the two clubs that don't try to pick up the pace," West told the Bergen Record on Wednesday. "They're two of the best teams in baseball. Why are they playing the slowest? It's pathetic and embarrassing. They take too long to play.''
Now it appears that West could be penalized for his brash comments, as sources told ESPN.com's Wallace Matthews that the crew chief is likely to be reprimanded.
According to Pedroia, it was quite obvious that the umpiring crew was dissatisfied with the rate of play.

Pandemic And Wildfire: California Is Preparing For A Crisis Within A Crisis
(CapRadio) Ezra David Romero, April 15
…To protect human health, prescribed burns are not allowed for the time being on Forest Service land. But Ryan Tompkins, a forest advisor with the UC Cooperative Extension for Plumas, Sierra, and Lassen counties, says it's still early enough to prepare for wildfire with other tools like thinning and in some cases burning.
“It is really difficult because of the concerns about smoke and COVID, but sort of now is our chance to be prepared,” said Tompkins.
…“We know the agencies are going to have maybe limited capacity, limited resources, they're going to have other strains on their organizations while dealing with this crisis,” Tompkins said. “So, I think it emphasizes in a silver lining way that we all have a piece to play or a role to play.”
Susie Kocher, a forest adviser for the Lake Tahoe region with the UC Cooperative Extension, is concerned about a triple threat of COVID-19, wildfires, and power shutoffs.
“These two potential situations just could stack on top of the uncertainty of what people need to do,” she said.

Sponsoring committee members are not required to have any affiliation with 4-H. We are looking for business leaders and other people who are well connected in the community and who are motivated to provide educational and leadership opportunities to our youth.
California dairies dump milk, crops may be left to wither as coronavirus pandemic disrupts food system
(SF Chronicle) Kurtis Alexander, April 12
…“Everybody's scrambling. The whole food system is scrambling,” said Daniel Sumner, an agricultural economist at UC Davis. “I don't see a big supply-side issue for agriculture. It's really an issue with the food (delivery) system.”
Widespread shutdown order slams California dairy farmers, ‘You can't turn off the cows'
(Sacramento Bee) Michael Finch II, April 10
…“Like every part of the food system, there are complications. The issue for milk is you can't turn off the cows,” said Daniel A. Sumner, an agricultural economist and professor at UC Davis. “What's becoming more of a problem is the slightly longer-term outlook where we have a massive recession (coming).”
Dairy prices are regulated by the federal government and fluctuate on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. So the price of large quantities of milk, cheese, whey and milk powder is set based on data from the prior month, Sumner said.
In January, milk traded at nearly 18 cents per pound and by March the amount fell nearly five cents. Sumner said this suggests there is a price shock to come in the summer.
Grocers Serving Low-Income Neighborhoods Pinched by Shortages, Rising Prices

…“This hoarding behavior is unfortunate,” said Richard Sexton, a professor of agriculture and resource economics at UC Davis. “We can understand why people do it, but it is what's causing these disruptions.”
… The current shortages could deepen disadvantages for family-owned neighborhood stores, said Sexton, the UC Davis economist.
“The little guys, the small chains of just a few stores, could get the short end of the stick in this situation because food manufacturers and distributors are going to probably prioritize their biggest and best customers,” he said.

Scientists Worry Agency Plan to Prevent Fires Could Do Opposite
(Bloomberg) Bobby Magill, April 9
…Controlling wildfire in the region depends on how many firefighters the federal government has on the ground—and they'd have to be in the right place at the right time for the fuels reduction plan to work, said Max Moritz, a wildfire specialist at the University of California, Santa Barbara studying how wildfire affects broad landscapes.
As the climate changes, the effectiveness of fuels reductions projects and fuel breaks begins to fade, he said.
“Climate change seems to be priming the landscape for fires to ignite more easily, spread more easily, to burn hotter and larger—so all of these aspects of climate change would make one suspect that fuel breaks have a harder and harder time doing their job,” Moritz said.
The wildfire program is an “expensive large-scale experiment,” he said.
The real reason we're seeing more wildlife during the pandemic
(Pop Sci) Ula Chrobak, April 9
…In those cases, additional sightings might be due to simple behavior changes. But a less charismatic creature may be also on the rise due to an increased human presence at home. Niamh Quinn, a human-wildlife interactions advisor with the University of California, thinks that rat populations may be increasing in New Orleans and elsewhere. That's because people are cooking, storing, and disposing of at home, drawing rats away from closed restaurants and toward residences.
…Quinn agrees. Late last year, she radio-collared five coyotes in Los Angeles for a research project. She says that her coyotes haven't changed their routines since the shelter-in-place order went into effect, staying in their respective territories, which include areas near

What key actions should a driver take when approaching a larger vehicle, such as a bus, according to the text
------------correct----------------------
ng
On some occasions there will be forced passing places in the road, this could be
for various reasons such as road works or to slow traffic down in that particular
road. You will normally see a road sign which will tell you in good time of an approaching
meeting situation, take a look at the following signs and their meanings so you
are prepared the next time you see them:
Figure 1: Various traffic signs that warn you of a narrowing of the road or forced
The road you are driving on might have a placed obstruction which will give you
priority over oncoming traffic or make you give way to oncoming vehicles, an example
of this is shown in figure 2 below:
Figure 2: Obstruction in road with forced priority
Passing a larger vehicle
Sometimes you might be forced to pass a larger vehicle and will have to use the
oncoming traffics lane to do so, there are a few things you need to remember if
you are going to pass a larger vehicle. Always leave a bigger gap when directly
following a larger vehicle, due to their sheer size you want to have a wider view
of what is in front of you if they stop and whether or not you can pass them, and
therefore being further back will widen your view. This is especially useful when
being behind a bus, they will stop quite frequently and you’ll need to keep an eye
out for passengers walking out from behind/in front of a bus, make sure you check
well ahead before you decide to pass a bus because any oncoming vehicles shouldn’t
be forced to slow down for you. Again, make sure you check your mirrors and indicate
right before you pass a stopped bus if anyone can benefit from your indication.
Check out the following video showing how to correctly pass a bus that has stopped:
Typical meeting/passing situations
There are a variety of typical everyday meeting/passing situations which you may come across, the more situations you come across will improve how you will deal with the next meeting/passing situation that arises. Have a look at the video below which shows a narrow residential road where meeting situations will almost certainly arise. Take special notice of how we have planned ahead to anticipate an oncoming vehicle.
FINELINES guide to dealing with meeting, passing and adequate clearance
Our end of tutorial guide will brush up everything we’ve gone over in this section,
don’t depend on this part alone however, have a read through the whole section and
watch the videos if you haven’t already. The only way to master this aspect of everyday
driving is to practise as many meeting/passing scenarios as possible because a lot
of your own judgement is needed in these situations. We at Fineline Driving Academy
always make sure our learners get extensive practise with passing/meeting situations
to make sure they are well prepared for their driving future. Here are the main
points that can be learned from this particular tutorial:
1) Plan well ahead to decide whether the road you are on narrows and realise if
a meeting situation is approaching.
2) Look out for road signs that tell you if the road narrows, or if priority is
given to yourself or oncoming vehicles.
3) If you are approaching the narrowing point of the road before the approaching
vehicle you should probably pass with the other vehicle holding back, if they reach
it first then you should hold back.
4) Try to leave at least a 2 car length gap between yourself and any parked vehicle
you wait behind.
5) Make sure you check your centre and right mirrors before continuing to make sure
nobody behind you is overtaking.
6) Steer quite sharply to clear the parked vehicle and leave a car doors width between
your car and the parked vehicle (if possible).
7) Keep further back behind a larger vehicle to widen your view, if you pass a pulled
over bus then look out for passengers walking out from behind/in front of the bus.
8) Only indicate as you pass a parked vehicle if someone will benefit, make sure
to cancel the indicator if you do indicate to prevent misleading other road users.
9) Judge each situation individually depending on what is going on at the time,
take every surrounding factor into account because there are many different types
of meeting/passing situations you can come across every day.

to align itself with the road map for the transitional government. As a result, UNDP refocused its activities around the following priorities:
- Support protection of people, their property and their rights by developing the capacities of communities to cope with the crises
- Facilitate the return of former rebels to their home regions in the Central African Republic and reactivate the resettlement programme in the north-west and central-north regions
- Facilitate technical implementation of the road map; the return to peace; the holding of free, democratic and transparent elections; and continued reforms in the justice sector; and
- Reactive the implementation of the accelerated MDG framework for food security

I know I said the next Rick's Rants would be a year in review, but I haven't finished it yet and this edition basically wrote itself, so all you avid readers out there will have to wait a little longer for me to reveal my top picks of 2007. Sunday was a rollercoaster of emotions starting with what may possibly be my last visit with my grandmother before she passes on. I then hopped on a flight taking me back to St. Louis for my last semester of college. Sitting on the plane listening to some sappy music, I over-thought the inevitable aging of my family members and myself. I arrived to the Giants beating my hometown of Philly's dire enemies, which was fleetingly comforting, but I needed something more. Come 7 o' clock, central time, I couched myself as I usually do on a Sunday night, and headed on over to FOX, a channel I haven't turned to in a long time. FOX really delivered escapism and hilarity to the max when I needed it most.
I don't think I've watched anything on FOX barring football games and a few episodes of Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? since I cut myself off from 24 and American Idol a few years back. I just couldn't resist a Terminator TV show, and apparently I'm not the only one. The premiere scored the highest ratings of any new show in the past 3 years. I must say I was pretty impressed with The Sarah Connor Chronicles. The action was fast and furious and looked fantastic to boot. I really liked how they established the timeline upfront, starting in 1999 and traveling to present day 2007. Since Sarah was attacked by the Governator in 1984 she's been through some serious shit including dying of cancer before Terminator 3. I know the majority opinion was that Terminator 3 was weak, but I must take the dissenting opinion on this one. I thought the action was pretty jawsome, a must for a Terminator movie, and the ending really brought the whole trilogy together for me in an unexpected and deeply satisfying way. I don't know if word has reached your ear yet of this new Terminator trilogy starting off in summer 2009 starring Christian Bale as John Conner, but I'd be much obliged to be the harbinger for those of you not in the know. Christian Bale is certainly making a good run for my coveted top actor spot. His roles have been diversified, yet all seem to fit quite nicely into my movie preference niche. His American Psycho was brilliant, Equilibrium was sweet, Michael Keaton's Batman would get his ass kicked by Bale's, and his performance as twin brothers in The Prestige is one of the finest displays of acting I've ever seen. With The Dark Knight coming this summer and Terminator next summer I think I might have to make a freaky shrine of Bale with a bust of his head made of Snapple caps or something... anyway... moving on.
The Family Guy commercials during Terminator were pretty enticing so it seemed only logical to keep it rolling with FOX. About 5 years ago Family Guy was god. Not a day would go by without some sort of Family Guy reference and the episodes from the first three seasons were watched repeatedly. Since those golden years I've seriously dropped the ball. I've seen maybe 4 episodes since season three (all of which failed to astonish) and the brilliant Star Wars spoof. Sunday night's episode was certainly dressed to impress. They did a hilarious take on teen dramas and somehow managed to make Peter as a stroke victim funny instead of cruel, which was an incredibly hard task because I just saw The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. For those of you out there who haven't yet, you're in for a treat; it's a movi

What is meeting, passing and adequate clearance?
Although the title of this tutorial might sound complicated, it involves a part
of driving that you will have to use probably every time you get behind the wheel.
Imagine driving down a typical urban road which has parked cars on both sides, a car is approaching you in the opposite direction and both of you can’t
pass each other at the same time due to the road not being wide enough. You’ll have
to pull in to an available space on the left to let them pass, or they must do that
same for you, then you’ll have to continue making sure you don’t get too close to
parked cars. This tutorial will go over the correct method of meeting vehicles whilst
driving and adequate clearance when passing parked vehicles.
How to know if a meeting situation is coming up
You will have to use some quick judgement to decide whether a meeting situation
is coming up, planning ahead is vital because you don’t want to end up in a situation
where you and an oncoming driver has tried to squeeze through the same space and
you both result in being stuck. When you are driving, have a look ahead and think
about any narrowing spaces which might be too tight for two cars to pass at the
same time, then you need to decide if you will hold back or whether it is more convenient
for the other vehicle to hold back. A general rule here is, if the space looks too
tight then you should hold back and continue after the oncoming vehicle has passed.
You should think about where the road begins to narrow, maybe there is a situation
approaching where a car is parked on either side of the road and they are opposite
each other therefore causing a narrowing of the road. If you are closer to the narrowing
than the oncoming vehicle, you should be able to pass through with the oncoming
vehicle holding back. Similarly if the other vehicle is closer to the narrowing
of the road, you should hold back and let the oncoming vehicle pass and then carry
on once it passes. The following video gives a demonstration of this:
What to do after the oncoming vehicle has passed
You’ll notice from the above video that our vehicle didn’t come to a stop, instead
it kept rolling and therefore avoiding the need to stop by planning ahead. This
will help keep traffic flowing and also reduce your carbon footprint because moving
your car off from a stationary position requires more power from the engine and
burns more fuel. You should always keep at least a 2 car length distance from yourself
and any parked car you are waiting behind (if this is possible), and make sure that
you check your centre and right mirrors before continuing because a following road user might try to overtake you. When you have checked the mirrors and continue, make
sure you turn enough to avoid clipping the parked car. This is what
adequate clearance means, a lot of parked vehicles are damaged, (and have their mirrors ripped off!) because passing vehicles
misjudge how close they are to the parked car, leaving a 2 car lengths distance
will help avoid any contact. Try to also leave a car doors width between you and
the parked car in case somebody in the parked vehicle opens their door.
Who should wait in a passing place?
This all depends on the situation and each situation should be treated with the surrounding
factors in mind. There are a few things to think about if you are approaching a
meeting situation, the first is whether both cars can pass at the same time or not,
make sure you know whats behind you and be prepared for peoples actions in the parked cars on
the road (somebody might open the door of the parked car as you pass it).
As mentioned a bit earlier, you really need to use your own judgement when meeting/passing
oncoming traffic. Not only should you judge the width of the road, you should also
judge how fast the oncoming car is travelling as well as their road position and
general driving behaviour, they may not hold back like you want them too and if
you think they might not then you should just wait. Is the oncoming vehicle larger
than normal? If so then they might not fit into the gap you are leaving them so
you should be courteous and hold back.

Only Nick Saban could turn a two-game losing streak into a $1-million-a-year raise.
And one of those losses was a come-from-ahead collapse against archenemy Auburn that had over-coaching written all over it.
Former Alabama coaches such as Mike DuBose or Mike Shula -- maybe that's Saban's saving grace; he isn't named Mike -- would have been fired before they could have reached the locker room if their teams had given up 13 points to the Tigers in the final 34 seconds.
Instead, the Alabama brass gave Saban a contract extension through 2022 and a $1 million raise to a preposterous $6.5 million a year. Never mind that within the narrow confines of major college football, $aint Nick is probably worth it. At least as long as he finally beats a ranked Auburn team when they meet again this season.
Because for all of Saban's success, that's never happened. He's 0-6 against Tigers teams that finished seasons with at least nine wins.
When Bill Curry went 0-3 against Auburn as the Tide coach in the late 1980s, he fled for the calamity that was Kentucky before his fourth season in T-town rather than have one more brick thrown through his office window for disappointing Houndstooth Nation.
But $aban gets a $1 million raise and extension after collapsing at Auburn, then getting outcoached and his Tide outplayed by Oklahoma in the Sugar Bowl. Poor OU coach Bob Stoops. He's still under $4.8 million per year (at least as of press time Tuesday night).
And what of Auburn coach Gus Malzahn, whose magical, maniacal offense has now bettered Saban two of the past four seasons? Should the Tigers again trip the Tide this autumn in Tuscaloosa, does Malzahn's $3.85 million deal escalate by $1 million a year? And shouldn't it, at least as long he can also grab his first official national championship? Technically, he was only the offensive coordinator when AU won it all in 2010 for since-fired Gene Chizik.
Then again, Saban did rescue former Tennessee head coach Lane Kiffin from the unemployment line, then pay him $680,000 a year. Has anyone ever had a softer landing falling off a Trojan horse?
So maybe the raise was more $aban displaying his humanity to man. Or maybe it was about fear. And fear only. Because life has been pretty good under $aban throughout his seven seasons at the Capstone. Three national championships. Four SEC West titles. Five BCS bowls.
That's legendary stuff. You could bring Bear Bryant back from the dead and hand him scholarship limits and academic performance requirements, and he might not duplicate half that success. And from this corner, Bear remains the best college coach ever.
But Alabama athletic director Bill Battle played for Bryant before he coached against him at Tennessee. He knew the Be

e that will remind you how remarkable life really is. A very special James Bond spoof American Dad immediately followed, Stan Smith: Tearjerker. I never really dug on American Dad like I did Seth MacFarlane's first child, but I thought this episode was clever and brought the mirth on strong. The diabolical plan boat tour which Tearjerker forcibly subjected our hero to was certainly a highlight. My friends weren't as impressed with American Dad so the channel quickly switched to a rerun of NBC's American Gladiators revival before the credits, which I can only assume were James Bond styled, rolled.
American Gladiators... I should state off the bat that after my incredibly satisfying evening with FOX I got up and left about 4.5 minutes into Gladiators. I elected to finish unpacking instead of watch a rerun which really says volumes about the weakness of the show. The gladiators all have catch phrases and are bat shit crazy; the one enjoyable part of the show. Each gladiator has a one liner they spew out every time the camera zooms in on them, except Wolf who just howls. I hope they don't get sued. SEGA's Wolf has had the same catchphrase since Virtua Fighter 2 back in 1994. Unfortunately the coolness factor of the gladiators can't save this pathetic attempt at entertainment. The contestants were way too annoying with "Big Country" hick ass Jeff at the top of my irritation list, with Christie getting an honorary mention. Thanks for perpetuating southern stereotypes big guy. The only thing more aggravating than the contestants is the final eliminator challenge. It's a completely illogical event with no clear rules and regulations that makes for totally unfair competition. Let me break it down for you. Contestants must first climb an 8 foot wall using a rope, jump into a pool and swim under a flaming surface and then climb a cargo net. No one has dived into the pool yet; I don't understand why, but at least it's fair so far. Then there's a barrel roll where the contestants must latch there body onto a barrel while it rolls down an incline. This portion of the event was taken directly from Ninja Warrior (a far superior analogous show), but in translation lost its justice. In Ninja Warrior if contestants fall off early they fall into a pool of water and are eliminated from the competition. If contestants fall off at any point on American Gladiators they land on a mat and are allowed to continue running the course without a time penalty (awful). Then they have to get across a large gap in one of two ways. They can peddle across on the extremely hard Handbike which takes time, energy and skill, or they can drop off the Handbike without even doing one rotation, run across the gap and then climb their way to the next platform with no time penalty of any kind (ridiculously awful). The last portion is the Travelator, an inclined treadmill with a rope that hangs half the distance to the top. That rope seems like a godsend but it's really a trap. If you grab the rope and try to set your feet you'll smack your face as your feet are swept away beneath you. In '"Big Country" Jeff's 15 minutes of fame he managed to fall down the Travelator about 15 times. NBC has already re-signed the show for a second season. I thought NBC pays people the big bucks! What genius designed that obstacle course? They best be retooling the course before next year or they may find themselves with seriously dwindling ratings. Let me know what you guys think about Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Family Guy and American Gladiators with a comment. Until next time...

The orchestral track "Shred I. Multiverse" from San Francisco Bay Area "blackened, technical post-death metallers" OBLIVION, who feature in their ranks former ALL SHALL PERISH guitarist Ben Orum on bass, can be streamed in the YouTube clip below. The song is one of three bonus tracks on OBLIVION's new album, "Called To Rise", which was released on January 1.
Commented OBLIVION vocalist Nick Vasallo: "As a band, OBLIVION doesn't want to just fit into the typical death metal category. Sure, we come from primarily a death metal background and we fulfill all the stylistic criteria associated with it. But we want our music to have broad conceptions and extreme depth.
"I composed a piece called 'Multiverse' that exists within two universes: metal and classical. The notes are identical and the music functions both as modern art music and modern extreme metal. We hired some of the top string players in the Bay Area to perform the work and recorded video of the sessions.
"One of the aspects that I want to bring from the metal world into the classical is the physical embodiment of the music. Notice how the musicians are almost obligated to move their bodies and headbang to the music in order to rhythmically play it.
"'Shred' is very rhythmic and, like a metal musician, requires total physical involvement with the music.
"The second movement, 'Long Deaf Hate', is a tribute to a band that every metalhead knows and by the end of the piece they should recognize the quotation from which I draw all the musical material fro

This pick is sort of a cheat. I think the intent with this day was for me to pick something small or indie, but there are only one or two of those in my whole collection and neither of them hold the place this one does in my memory.
Of the now 7,904 comics in my collection, only 32 are listed as being in Black & White. Seven of those are reprints of the UK Captain Britain magazine, eleven are a "dirty" sword and sorcery book by Bill Willingham, and four are John Byrne's OMAC series from 1991.
There is a "Thunderbunny" that I hunted down because it takes place in my hometown of Rutland, VT (I now own 20 Rutland Issues!) and a few other random books.
But this one is the one. Start with that cover. Beautifully painted by Paul Gulacy with some nice touches (Iceman's translucency is nice and subtle) it lets you know you are in for three good stories.

------------question-----------------------
What entertainment did the author turn to on FOX that provided them with escapism and hilarity during an emotional time
------------correct----------------------
I know I said the next Rick's Rants would be a year in review, but I haven't finished it yet and this edition basically wrote itself, so all you avid readers out there will have to wait a little longer for me to reveal my top picks of 2007. Sunday was a rollercoaster of emotions starting with what may possibly be my last visit with my grandmother before she passes on. I then hopped on a flight taking me back to St. Louis for my last semester of college. Sitting on the plane listening to some sappy music, I over-thought the inevitable aging of my family members and myself. I arrived to the Giants beating my hometown of Philly's dire enemies, which was fleetingly comforting, but I needed something more. Come 7 o' clock, central time, I couched myself as I usually do on a Sunday night, and headed on over to FOX, a channel I haven't turned to in a long time. FOX really delivered escapism and hilarity to the max when I needed it most.
I don't think I've watched anything on FOX barring football games and a few episodes of Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? since I cut myself off from 24 and American Idol a few years back. I just couldn't resist a Terminator TV show, and apparently I'm not the only one. The premiere scored the highest ratings of any new show in the past 3 years. I must say I was pretty impressed with The Sarah Connor Chronicles. The action was fast and furious and looked fantastic to boot. I really liked how they established the timeline upfront, starting in 1999 and traveling to present day 2007. Since Sarah was attacked by the Governator in 1984 she's been through some serious shit including dying of cancer before Terminator 3. I know the majority opinion was that Terminator 3 was weak, but I must take the dissenting opinion on this one. I thought the action was pretty jawsome, a must for a Terminator movie, and the ending really brought the whole trilogy together for me in an unexpected and deeply satisfying way. I don't know if word has reached your ear yet of this new Terminator trilogy starting off in summer 2009 starring Christian Bale as John Conner, but I'd be much obliged to be the harbinger for those of you not in the know. Christian Bale is certainly making a good run for my coveted top actor spot. His roles have been diversified, yet all seem to fit quite nicely into my movie preference niche. His American Psycho was brilliant, Equilibrium was sweet, Michael Keaton's Batman would get his ass kicked by Bale's, and his performance as twin brothers in The Prestige is one of the finest displays of acting I've ever seen. With The Dark Knight coming this summer and Terminator next summer I think I might have to make a freaky shrine of Bale with a bust of his head made of Snapple caps or something... anyway... moving on.
The Family Guy commercials during Terminator were pretty enticing so it seemed only logical to keep it rolling with FOX. About 5 years ago Family Guy was god. Not a day would go by without some sort of Family Guy reference and the episodes from the first three seasons were watched repeatedly. Since those golden years I've seriously dropped the ball. I've seen maybe 4 episodes since season three (all of which failed to astonish) and the brilliant Star Wars spoof. Sunday night's episode was certainly dressed to impress. They did a hilarious take on teen dramas and somehow managed to make Peter as a stroke victim funny instead of cruel, which was an incredibly hard task because I just saw The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. For those of you out there who haven't yet, you're in for a treat; it's a movi

------------question-----------------------
What was Red Sox manager Terry Francona's reaction to the comments made by West regarding the length of games
------------correct----------------------
gel [Hernandez] denied [Derek] Jeter a timeout?" Pedroia asked. "Ridiculous."
The three games of the series lasted 3 hours and 46 minutes, 3:48 and 3:21 (10 innings), respectively.
Yankees closer Mariano Rivera was equally peeved at West's comments, telling ESPN.com, "If he has places to go, let him do something else. What does he want us to do, swing at balls?"
Red Sox manager Terry Francona, when asked about West's controversial comments, was careful to be a bit more diplomatic.
"Obviously, I think I need to be somewhat careful is the right word, selective,'' Francona told the Web site. "I mean, I think it kind of surprised all of us. When you have somebody in charge of running the game without bias, and then you hear those comments coming out pretty strong, it probably worries you a little bit.''
But Francona doesn't necessarily believe that nothing needs to change about the length of these games.
"They always have been [too long], and are probably always gonna be,'' he said. "I've had 20 knee surgeries. I'm not jogging to the mound. I can't do it. It hurts.''

DR Winners Draw Branders Into Competition1 May, 2009 By: Thomas Haire Response
Brand marketers' expansion into the DRTV space during the past decade has been well documented. Perhaps no two verticals have been more affected by this change than the beauty-and-personal-care space and the housewares market.
Whether it is a direct attack — think Neutrogena's direct attack on Proactiv Solution with its new skin iD product in 2008 — or an attempt by a major conglomerate to capitalize on a new market created by a hot direct response product, today's branders can't seem to get enough of the opportunities that await them in DRTV.
Opportunity doesn't necessarily breed success, however. Here's a look at four different cases of products from brand marketers created and designed to take on DRTV champions in recent years.
Proactiv Solution vs. Neutrogena skin iD
According to Guthy-Renker Corp.'s Web site, www.proactiv.com, "Instead of treating one pimple at a time, the Proactiv system was developed to treat your whole face and help prevent acne before it starts. That's the Proactiv difference. With just three simple steps a day, you can stop the suffering and start living with the clear, radiant complexion you've always wanted."
First marketed via infomercial in 1994, Proactiv Solution is the preeminent DRTV skincare brand. TNS Media Intelligence measured Guthy-Renker's short-form DRTV spe

What concerns does Kentucky coach Mitch Barnhart have regarding the compensation of basketball coach John Calipari
------------correct----------------------
ar as well as anyone. He also knows just how good Saban is, and he wants no part of being remembered as the AD who somehow let him slip away.
Kentucky coach Mitch Barnhart likely travels that same path with basketball coach John Calipari, who's reached three Final Fours and won one national title during his five years in Lexington. Does Barnhart privately believe Coach Cal's worth the $5.4 million he made this past season? Probably not. Yet he's smart enough to know that having once hired the disaster that was Billy Clyde Gillispie, he better pay Cal whatever he wants whenever he wants it.
And given that passion for winning at any cost, what Southern major college president at a school best known for an athletic program would ever want to stand up to that program's coach over principles and priorities?
To repeat an old line once attributed to the University of Oklahoma president during the school's football superiority of the 1950s: "We just hope to have a university to make the football team proud."
There is also a flip side to this that every Alabama fan should be justifiably proud of, however wrongheaded this all looks. Thanks mostly to football, the Tide athletic department ran $34 million in the black during the 2012-13 school year and returned $6.5 million to the academic side of UA. So it basically paid for $aban's whole salary. Similar numbers should arrive for this year.
Nor does Saban apparently mind subliminally assessing blame for last year where he believes it's justified. While all of his assistants received contract extensions through February of 2016, only wideouts coach Billy Napier (from Murray County, Ga.) received no increase in pay. Better dip into your pocket for more sticky gloves, Billy. Need more sticky gloves.
So here we go again down here in SEC country, where three of the nation's six highest paid coaches -- Saban (1), Texas A&M's Kevin Sumlin (3) and LSU's Les Miles (6) -- make most of the rest of the coaching community green with envy.
Yet while we pour hundreds of millions into renovating already lavish football stadiums, pay the coaches whatever they want while often freezing faculty pay and hike tuition by 8 percent or more, we might also pause to wonder why a story on our website Tuesday afternoon declared that six of the 10 dumbest states in America based on percent of the population with a bachelor's degree, median household income and 2010 average SAT score were home to SEC schools, including Alabama at No. 7 and Tennessee in 10th.
The smartest state in America by those criteria was Massachusetts. Coincidence or not, the Minutemen's new coach, Mark Whipple, will earn a base salary of $250,000 this fall.

ar as well as anyone. He also knows just how good Saban is, and he wants no part of being remembered as the AD who somehow let him slip away.
Kentucky coach Mitch Barnhart likely travels that same path with basketball coach John Calipari, who's reached three Final Fours and won one national title during his five years in Lexington. Does Barnhart privately believe Coach Cal's worth the $5.4 million he made this past season? Probably not. Yet he's smart enough to know that having once hired the disaster that was Billy Clyde Gillispie, he better pay Cal whatever he wants whenever he wants it.
And given that passion for winning at any cost, what Southern major college president at a school best known for an athletic program would ever want to stand up to that program's coach over principles and priorities?
To repeat an old line once attributed to the University of Oklahoma president during the school's football superiority of the 1950s: "We just hope to have a university to make the football team proud."
There is also a flip side to this that every Alabama fan should be justifiably proud of, however wrongheaded this all looks. Thanks mostly to football, the Tide athletic department ran $34 million in the black during the 2012-13 school year and returned $6.5 million to the academic side of UA. So it basically paid for $aban's whole salary. Similar numbers should arrive for this year.
Nor does Saban apparently mind subliminally assessing blame for last year where he believes it's justified. While all of his assistants received contract extensions through February of 2016, only wideouts coach Billy Napier (from Murray County, Ga.) received no increase in pay. Better dip into your pocket for more sticky gloves, Billy. Need more sticky gloves.

What type of insights can brands access from tagged Instagram stories and posts
------------correct----------------------
ged photos and stories, meaning that brands now have access to information such as, reach, taps forward, taps backward, replies and exits. While the data on regular feed posts last forever, insight on stories will only last 14 days.
Okay, I Love It. So How Do I Set It Up?
As of now, Instagram is choosing the brands and influencers it rolls these new tools out to first. However, if you have a business account there is a good chance that Instagram has already offered this feature to you, and if they haven’t, rest assured it will be available soon!
Once approved to use this tool, follow this easy process to set it up!
Tagging Brands in Photos
- Select a photo like usual. Add a caption and any effects or filters you’d like then hit the next button.
- Once you’ve hit the next button you’re taken to a screen where you have the option to tag people, add a location, share to another social platform, or choose advanced settings. Tap advanced settings and then tap business partner.
- Once tapping the business partner option, search for the business you’d like to tag and select them to have them show up in your post.
Tagging Brands in Stories
- Starting from your Instagram feed, select the camera icon in the top left-hand corner of the screen to begin your story.
- Once you’ve taken the photo or video, tap the link icon in the top right-hand section of the screen.
- Next, the option to tag a business partner will appear in which you can then search for the business you’d like to select. Once selected the picture will then be tagged with “paid partnership with” when people view your story.
Both creators and businesses can require approval before being tagged in content, giving everyone full access to what they want their name and brand on.
To Set up Partner Approval
- First, go to your Instagram settings and select business settings.
- Under business settings tap “Branded content approvals”. Now you can either select the creators you’d like to approve or turn on the “require approval” toggle which will assure that you’ll be contacted each time you are tagged in a post.
How to View Insights From an Approved Influencer’s Post
- Go to your Facebook page and click on the insights tab.
- Once you’re in the insights tab, find the section where it says branded content and choose the influencers post which you’d like to view.
- From there you’ll be able to view insights in real time.
If you’re viewing from the business manager the process is a little different.
- First, you’ll want to go to the business manager and find the section that says measure and report.
- From measure and report click on branded content to view all of you insights.
Another noteworthy thing about this new Instagram feature is that as a brand and creator you can control who tags you in posts AND remove your brand from tagged brand content. Remove your brand from tagged content will take your brand name off of the post, however, the post will remain on Instagram and you will no longer have access to the post insights.
Now, What Does This Mean For Marketing?
So does this new feature mean the end of hashtags like #ad and #spon? Not exactly. We have to remember that Instagram has just rolled out this feature, and like all new tools, not all the bugs are worked out right away.
As a brand and creator, it’s important to talk with your team to make sure you are legally covered when posting content.
It is safe to say though, that this new tool is a huge step in reducing the confusion between sponsored and authentic Instagram posts and will provide marketers with even more powerful information to support their advertising efforts

What episode of American Dad is mentioned as being particularly clever in the text
------------correct----------------------
e that will remind you how remarkable life really is. A very special James Bond spoof American Dad immediately followed, Stan Smith: Tearjerker. I never really dug on American Dad like I did Seth MacFarlane's first child, but I thought this episode was clever and brought the mirth on strong. The diabolical plan boat tour which Tearjerker forcibly subjected our hero to was certainly a highlight. My friends weren't as impressed with American Dad so the channel quickly switched to a rerun of NBC's American Gladiators revival before the credits, which I can only assume were James Bond styled, rolled.
American Gladiators... I should state off the bat that after my incredibly satisfying evening with FOX I got up and left about 4.5 minutes into Gladiators. I elected to finish unpacking instead of watch a rerun which really says volumes about the weakness of the show. The gladiators all have catch phrases and are bat shit crazy; the one enjoyable part of the show. Each gladiator has a one liner they spew out every time the camera zooms in on them, except Wolf who just howls. I hope they don't get sued. SEGA's Wolf has had the same catchphrase since Virtua Fighter 2 back in 1994. Unfortunately the coolness factor of the gladiators can't save this pathetic attempt at entertainment. The contestants were way too annoying with "Big Country" hick ass Jeff at the top of my irritation list, with Christie getting an honorary mention. Thanks for perpetuating southern stereotypes big guy. The only thing more aggravating than the contestants is the final eliminator challenge. It's a completely illogical event with no clear rules and regulations that makes for totally unfair competition. Let me break it down for you. Contestants must first climb an 8 foot wall using a rope, jump into a pool and swim under a flaming surface and then climb a cargo net. No one has dived into the pool yet; I don't understand why, but at least it's fair so far. Then there's a barrel roll where the contestants must latch there body onto a barrel while it rolls down an incline. This portion of the event was taken directly from Ninja Warrior (a far superior analogous show), but in translation lost its justice. In Ninja Warrior if contestants fall off early they fall into a pool of water and are eliminated from the competition. If contestants fall off at any point on American Gladiators they land on a mat and are allowed to continue running the course without a time penalty (awful). Then they have to get across a large gap in one of two ways. They can peddle across on the extremely hard Handbike which takes time, energy and skill, or they can drop off the Handbike without even doing one rotation, run across the gap and then climb their way to the next platform with no time penalty of any kind (ridiculously awful). The last portion is the Travelator, an inclined treadmill with a rope that hangs half the distance to the top. That rope seems like a godsend but it's really a trap. If you grab the rope and try to set your feet you'll smack your face as your feet are swept away beneath you. In '"Big Country" Jeff's 15 minutes of fame he managed to fall down the Travelator about 15 times. NBC has already re-signed the show for a second season. I thought NBC pays people the big bucks! What genius designed that obstacle course? They best be retooling the course before next year or they may find themselves with seriously dwindling ratings. Let me know what you guys think about Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Family Guy and American Gladiators with a comment. Until next time...

------------question-----------------------
What type of products does the OxiClean brand include
------------correct----------------------
nding in 2008 at $206.5 million.
Five different offers are available online, ranging from 60-day risk-free trial, five-piece deluxe system for $59.95 (including two-for-one special and free bonuses) to an entry-point offer for three-piece, 30-day trial for $19.95.
Jessica Simpson, Alyssa Milano, Vanessa Williams, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Serena Williams, among others.
OxiClean vs. Clorox OxiMagic
The OxiClean brand of stain removal products, marketed by product conglomerate Church & Dwight, includes a number of laundry, carpet, baby and outdoor cleaning products marketed via direct response TV, online and at retail.
The OxiClean brand was the brainchild of the Appel Family, who had made Orange Glo a famous household product. OxiClean, pitched by the now legendary Billy Mays, became a giant DRTV hit in 2001, eventually transitioning to retail before the family sold Orange Glo Intl., to Church & Dwight in 2006 for $325 million.
Though the OxiClean line is now a retail giant, DRTV ads now often direct consumers to the OxiClean Web site (www.oxiclean.com) for purchase, as well as for special coupon offers to purchase at retail outlets. DRTV-to-online couponing became a popular way for major household product marketers (think Procter & Gamble, Clorox and others) to test DRTV as a new marketing method in the earlier part of this decade. Now, a true DRTV stalwart uses the same tactics.

Despite there being a lack of real news detailing any real progress in terms of Villa transfers, it hasn’t stopped the publication of hundreds of Villa transfer rumour stories (most of them rehashed mutations of each other) doing the rounds. The running theme seems to be patience is needed, before things start to kick into action at the end of the week, with the window opening for real on July 1st.
So far, the main recent transfer rumour concerns apart from the goalkeeping position (with Sam Johnstone still expected to be the number one, at least for next season) are as follows:
Terry Defo Incoming?
Saturday – watch this space. The picture will probably become a lot clearer then, if it’s happening, with there even the chance of seeing JT wearing a new Villa kit. I’ll discuss MOMS actual thoughts on JT elsewhere).
If Terry comes in, then I’d expect the Daily Mail’s story today putting Villa in the mix for Bristol City’s 6ft 5 centre back Aden Flint to be going up a cul-de-sac.
The 27-year-old is valued, according to the paper, at £4m, with Fulham and Middlesbrough supposedly in the hunt.
Villa would have too many centre-backs on their books with Micah Richards and Tommy Elphick needing to find new clubs, before Villa can entertain any others, especially if Terry does come in.
Gil Tug of War
Before the Villa players are called back to Bodymoor Heath next month to begin their preseason, the fate of Carles Gil will probably have been decided, with either Deportivo La Coruna and Real Betis the likely destination based on reports last week.
Villa are no doubt playing hardball over the price to ensure getting the best deal possible for the 24-year-old, whose reputation hasn’t been too damaged despite a largely unsettled time at Villa.
Recent reports in Spain, suggest that Villa are looking for a figure twice as much as the sub 2m Euro offers that have come in so far for Gil. Will Villa dig their heals in so much that, they’ll let it play out until the end of the transfer window and Gil will be forced back to Bodymoor Heath?
It’s doubtful and maybe self-defeating in the respect of not wanting any bad blood in the preseason training camp, where a promotion-focused squad has to be built asap.
In an ideal world, it would have been good to have Gil in the Villa squad for next season, as he offers the kind of guile that is rare in the division. It ain’t going to happen though, due to both the player’s wish of staying in Spain and also Bruce’s outlook in how Villa are to play.

at all and how I have always operated, you would understand my reluctance – at first – in understanding what God was telling me to do. I have never in all my life left a place of employment, without having something lined up to go to next.
I have always been very practical in that way. Always have had a backup plan; not this. time.
This time, I am trusting God to lead me where He wants me to go. I believe He is calling me into using my gifts of words to minister to others. So, with that being said, I am currently working on a book to encourage others and offer hope. I will continue to write this blog, not just to share Jesus with others, but because I feel this is a small part of His plan for me.

ander, March 9
… “It's not fair to say that fuel treatments won't do any good,” said Max Moritz, a UC Cooperative Extension wildfire specialist at UC Santa Barbara. “It may provide some protection in some places. But most of us studying this agree that you can't just do this and (expect to) make much headway.”
The plan by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, comes at the request of Gov. Gavin Newsom. On his second day in office, Newsom asked the agency to develop a proposal to address the increasingly destructive fire seasons that have rattled the state and are expected to worsen with climate change.
…In the meantime, many researchers say the most effective approach to fire protection is not in the forests, but in communities. They recommend making homes more resistant to fire with hardier construction materials, and clearing the vegetation around them.
“You have to address the home vulnerabilities themselves,” said Moritz at UC Santa Barbara. “If you don't, you're just not going to make a lot of progress on fire.”
After more than 140 years, a massive fig tree gracing the plaza where Los Angeles was founded collapses
(LA Times) Matthew Ormseth, March 9
… The four figs were planted at El Pueblo by agriculturalist and City Councilman Elijah Hook Workman, KCET reported in 2013. The Ficus macrophylla was brought from Australia to Southern California in the 1860s and 1870s, probably to provide shade and ornamentation, said Donald Hodel, a horticulture advisor for the University of California's Cooperative Extension.
Hodel described the Moreton Bay fig as a commanding breed of tree with an enveloping canopy that threw plenty of shade.
His reasons for admiring the Moreton Bay fig: “Their grandeur; their size — they have an imposing habit; their root structure is incredible; the spreading nature of their branches.”
Hodel said he last saw the El Pueblo figs about six years ago.
“I wasn't too impressed by their health or their size, considering they're 140-something years old,” he said.

4-H leader who taught lost Benbow girls outdoor skills being flown to Washington, DC for recognition
Kym Kemp, March 7
When Leia Carrico, age 8, and her sister, Caroline, age 5, disappeared into the woods around their home near Benbow on March 1, the whole nation held its breath for the next 44 hours until they were found. But, though their 4-H leaders were worried, too, they say they also knew the girls had something many other children don't–they had survival skills from a class taught by their Outdoor Adventures 4-H project leader, Justin Lehnert.
Lehnert is being honored in Washington, DC, on Tuesday for his role in teaching Leia and Caroline outdoor skills.
Researchers highlight plan to eat healthy on a budget
(Consumer Affairs) Kristen Dalli, March 7
Following a healthy diet can come with a hefty price tag, but a team of researchers has outlined a way for consumers to stick to a healthy diet -- and also stick to their budgets.
According to the team, consumers -- and their families -- can have healthy meals if they focus on buying items in bulk and planning meals in advance.
“This study determines the likelihood that families living in low-income households could create meals that meet the USDA dietary guidelines presented in MyPlate nutrition education materials,” said researcher Karen M. Jetter, PhD. “In addition to food cost, the other factors considered were access to stores, time for meal preparation, and whether the menus included culturally appropriate foods.”

Sorry, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, but “farting cows” aren't the problem
(New Food Economy) Sam Bloch, March 7
…As it turns out, neither side was accurate. Republicans are likely to continue linking Green New Deal priorities to a supposed hamburger ban. But if you don't hear about cow farts anymore from AOC, it may not be because of GOP criticism. Frank Mitloehner, an animal scientist and air quality specialist at the University of California, Davis, insists cattle flatulence isn't the problem it's made out to be, and says he helped set the record straight.
Here's what seems to have happened. On February 4, shortly before Ocasio-Cortez announced the Green New Deal, she was speaking to school children in Queens, New York. When one asked how they could “combat” climate change, Ocasio-Cortez offered two practical options—stop using disposable razors, and skip meat and dairy for one meal.
Mitloehner tweeted at her.
“Dear @AOC: we all try to help the climate,” he wrote. “However, the two options you offered have low impacts compared to the 800lb gorilla, which is to reduce fossil fuel use. About ? of greenhouse gas emissions in the US stem from transport and energy prod&use. Meat/milk = 4 % of total GHG,” referring to findings in a recent EPA report.
… “I give her team a lot of credit for reaching out,” Mitloehner says. “If we really are serious about making a difference in carbon emissions, you cannot do this without agriculture involved.”
California supplies a quarter of the world's sunflower seeds
(Capital Press) Padma Nagappan, March 7
…Khaled Bali is a University of California Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources statewide water and irrigation specialist who has been working since 2016 on a four-year trial on sunflower varieties.
He was asked by the University of Georgia to help ascertain which varieties were drought resistant. He chose to conduct his trial in the low desert region of the Imperial Valley, since it gets little rain during the growing season between February when it's planted, and June when it's harvested. This would make it easier to control and measure the actual water applied to the crop varieties.
“We're looking at 285 varieties of sunflowers, to see which ones do well under stress,” Bali said. He has tested different plantings each growing season for the past three years, and will finish the trial this year.
Livestream coverage of fire protection panel discussion in Nevada City
(Sierra Sun) March 7
…Following the films, the community is invited to join an ongoing conversation around the new reality of living with fire in the wildland urban interface. Panelists represent a diverse cross-section of the wildfire prevention community including: Cal Fire, Fire Safe Council of Nevada County, Nevada County Office of Emergency Services, Nevada County Resource Conservation District, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Tahoe National Forest and University of California Cooperative Extension. The panel discussion will be moderated by YubaNet Co-founder Pascale Fusshoeller. [Kate Wilkin, UCCE fire advisor, participates on the panel in the last hour of the video.]
Bees, blooms off to slow start
(Western Farm Press) Logan Hawkes, March 6
…This year, almond bloom started around a normal time, with some early varieties showing a few open flowers in the first week of February,” reported Franz Niederholzer, UCCE farm advisor for Colusa, Sutter, and Yuba Counties. “For most of the month bloom progressed very slowly,”
By the middle of February, he says, “bloom for Nonpareil was at least two weeks behind, and bee hours were limited until the last week of the month. Last year, between Feb 1-20, we accumulated 130 bee hours of good honey bee flying weather [55 F., no rain, and wind less than 10 mph]. For the same interval this year, we had around 10 hours and only six of those occurred with open flowers

o are ready to buy and to facilitate the queries of those who are not ready to commit to a purchase. It is designed to address the changing face of automotive retail.
Conversational Marketing in automotive retail provides anytime, anywhere, device-agnostic engagement. Whether potential buyers visit a website on their desktop, mobile phone or tablet, conversational assistants instantly guide them on their purchase or product discovery journey.
Unlike the usual live chat assistance or automated bots, Conversational Marketing in automotive retail initiates intelligent conversation that feels natural and takes a logical path focused on giving buyers what they’re there for; suggesting the right options, such as connecting a potential buyer to a sales representative via VoIP or scheduling a call at a more convenient time; or – if you’re trying to increase pre-qualified leads through your website – redirecting buyers to book a test drive with the nearest dealership.
A Conversational Marketing platform is enabling key capabilities to automotive clients:
– Redirects potential buyers to a website to join live video sessions where a representative shows the car model and explains its features. This can occur at scale to an unlimited number of online customers.
– Customers and reps can use live video, co-browsing and live messaging to arrive at decisions on the trim best suited to customers’ requirements.
– Customers are assured of real-time, highly personalized assistance on a device of their choice.
– Conversational Marketing fits in nicely with evolving omnichannel formats, including test drive centers, mobile stores, and boutique stores.
An enhanced web experience can motivate buyers trying your brand for the first time to prioritize you over the other 3-4 automakers on their list or motivate enthusiastic customers who have already done most of the research about your model to advance their test drive.
Wold leading car brand such as Opel, Toyota, and Citroen have utilized Whisbi’s Conversational Marketing platform to significantly increase sales outcomes, reduce abandonment rates, and boost cross-selling and upselling.
Besides supporting sales goals, the digital experience provided by a Conversational Marketing platform also enhances brand reputation. Customers feel more compelled to trust you and don’t hesitate to return for more queries.
Automotive retail must address rising expectations from the digital-first customer and competition from new mobility concepts. Even as markets in the United States, Europe, and China are trending downwards, Morgan Stanley forecasts a 4% fall in global auto production, which is expected to strain automakers’ and suppliers’ profits. In rethinking their business models to counter forces and sail through a weak economic climate, automakers are rejigging their marketing and sales strategies.
Although digital engagement cannot replicate the intimacy of face-to-face interaction at a dealership, it can ensure sufficiently enjoyable and educational one-to-one and one-to-many conversations that lead to test drives and sales. A Conversational Marketing platform in the automotive industry is a powerful solution that pre-qualifies, cross-sells, upsells and links customers in real-time to other retail channels, matching intent with the right suggestions and persuading quick action to drive up sales outcomes

What are the main recent transfer rumors concerning Aston Villa as reported in the text
------------correct----------------------
Despite there being a lack of real news detailing any real progress in terms of Villa transfers, it hasn’t stopped the publication of hundreds of Villa transfer rumour stories (most of them rehashed mutations of each other) doing the rounds. The running theme seems to be patience is needed, before things start to kick into action at the end of the week, with the window opening for real on July 1st.
So far, the main recent transfer rumour concerns apart from the goalkeeping position (with Sam Johnstone still expected to be the number one, at least for next season) are as follows:
Terry Defo Incoming?

If Terry comes in, then I’d expect the Daily Mail’s story today putting Villa in the mix for Bristol City’s 6ft 5 centre back Aden Flint to be going up a cul-de-sac.
The 27-year-old is valued, according to the paper, at £4m, with Fulham and Middlesbrough supposedly in the hunt.
Villa would have too many centre-backs on their books with Micah Richards and Tommy Elphick needing to find new clubs, before Villa can entertain any others, especially if Terry does come in.
Gil Tug of War
Before the Villa players are called back to Bodymoor Heath next month to begin their preseason, the fate of Carles Gil will probably have been decided, with either Deportivo La Coruna and Real Betis the likely destination based on reports last week.
Villa are no doubt playing hardball over the price to ensure getting the best deal possible for the 24-year-old, whose reputation hasn’t been too damaged despite a largely unsettled time at Villa.
Recent reports in Spain, suggest that Villa are looking for a figure twice as much as the sub 2m Euro offers that have come in so far for Gil. Will Villa dig their heals in so much that, they’ll let it play out until the end of the transfer window and Gil will be forced back to Bodymoor Heath?
It’s doubtful and maybe self-defeating in the respect of not wanting any bad blood in the preseason training camp, where a promotion-focused squad has to be built asap.
In an ideal world, it would have been good to have Gil in the Villa squad for next season, as he offers the kind of guile that is rare in the division. It ain’t going to happen though, due to both the player’s wish of staying in Spain and also Bruce’s outlook in how Villa are to play.

Despite there being a lack of real news detailing any real progress in terms of Villa transfers, it hasn’t stopped the publication of hundreds of Villa transfer rumour stories (most of them rehashed mutations of each other) doing the rounds. The running theme seems to be patience is needed, before things start to kick into action at the end of the week, with the window opening for real on July 1st.
So far, the main recent transfer rumour concerns apart from the goalkeeping position (with Sam Johnstone still expected to be the number one, at least for next season) are as follows:

What should you consider when approaching a meeting situation while driving in narrow urban roads
------------correct----------------------
What is meeting, passing and adequate clearance?
Although the title of this tutorial might sound complicated, it involves a part
of driving that you will have to use probably every time you get behind the wheel.
Imagine driving down a typical urban road which has parked cars on both sides, a car is approaching you in the opposite direction and both of you can’t
pass each other at the same time due to the road not being wide enough. You’ll have
to pull in to an available space on the left to let them pass, or they must do that
same for you, then you’ll have to continue making sure you don’t get too close to
parked cars. This tutorial will go over the correct method of meeting vehicles whilst
driving and adequate clearance when passing parked vehicles.
How to know if a meeting situation is coming up
You will have to use some quick judgement to decide whether a meeting situation
is coming up, planning ahead is vital because you don’t want to end up in a situation
where you and an oncoming driver has tried to squeeze through the same space and
you both result in being stuck. When you are driving, have a look ahead and think
about any narrowing spaces which might be too tight for two cars to pass at the
same time, then you need to decide if you will hold back or whether it is more convenient
for the other vehicle to hold back. A general rule here is, if the space looks too
tight then you should hold back and continue after the oncoming vehicle has passed.
You should think about where the road begins to narrow, maybe there is a situation
approaching where a car is parked on either side of the road and they are opposite
each other therefore causing a narrowing of the road. If you are closer to the narrowing
than the oncoming vehicle, you should be able to pass through with the oncoming
vehicle holding back. Similarly if the other vehicle is closer to the narrowing
of the road, you should hold back and let the oncoming vehicle pass and then carry
on once it passes. The following video gives a demonstration of this:
What to do after the oncoming vehicle has passed
You’ll notice from the above video that our vehicle didn’t come to a stop, instead
it kept rolling and therefore avoiding the need to stop by planning ahead. This
will help keep traffic flowing and also reduce your carbon footprint because moving
your car off from a stationary position requires more power from the engine and
burns more fuel. You should always keep at least a 2 car length distance from yourself
and any parked car you are waiting behind (if this is possible), and make sure that
you check your centre and right mirrors before continuing because a following road user might try to overtake you. When you have checked the mirrors and continue, make
sure you turn enough to avoid clipping the parked car. This is what
adequate clearance means, a lot of parked vehicles are damaged, (and have their mirrors ripped off!) because passing vehicles
misjudge how close they are to the parked car, leaving a 2 car lengths distance
will help avoid any contact. Try to also leave a car doors width between you and
the parked car in case somebody in the parked vehicle opens their door.
Who should wait in a passing place?
This all depends on the situation and each situation should be treated with the surrounding
factors in mind. There are a few things to think about if you are approaching a
meeting situation, the first is whether both cars can pass at the same time or not,
make sure you know whats behind you and be prepared for peoples actions in the parked cars on
the road (somebody might open the door of the parked car as you pass it).
As mentioned a bit earlier, you really need to use your own judgement when meeting/passing
oncoming traffic. Not only should you judge the width of the road, you should also
judge how fast the oncoming car is travelling as well as their road position and
general driving behaviour, they may not hold back like you want them too and if
you think they might not then you should just wait. Is the oncoming vehicle larger
than normal? If so then they might not fit into the gap you are leaving them so
you should be courteous and hold back.

What are some key capabilities of a Conversational Marketing platform that assists automotive clients in increasing sales outcomes
------------correct----------------------
o are ready to buy and to facilitate the queries of those who are not ready to commit to a purchase. It is designed to address the changing face of automotive retail.
Conversational Marketing in automotive retail provides anytime, anywhere, device-agnostic engagement. Whether potential buyers visit a website on their desktop, mobile phone or tablet, conversational assistants instantly guide them on their purchase or product discovery journey.
Unlike the usual live chat assistance or automated bots, Conversational Marketing in automotive retail initiates intelligent conversation that feels natural and takes a logical path focused on giving buyers what they’re there for; suggesting the right options, such as connecting a potential buyer to a sales representative via VoIP or scheduling a call at a more convenient time; or – if you’re trying to increase pre-qualified leads through your website – redirecting buyers to book a test drive with the nearest dealership.
A Conversational Marketing platform is enabling key capabilities to automotive clients:
– Redirects potential buyers to a website to join live video sessions where a representative shows the car model and explains its features. This can occur at scale to an unlimited number of online customers.
– Customers and reps can use live video, co-browsing and live messaging to arrive at decisions on the trim best suited to customers’ requirements.
– Customers are assured of real-time, highly personalized assistance on a device of their choice.
– Conversational Marketing fits in nicely with evolving omnichannel formats, including test drive centers, mobile stores, and boutique stores.
An enhanced web experience can motivate buyers trying your brand for the first time to prioritize you over the other 3-4 automakers on their list or motivate enthusiastic customers who have already done most of the research about your model to advance their test drive.
Wold leading car brand such as Opel, Toyota, and Citroen have utilized Whisbi’s Conversational Marketing platform to significantly increase sales outcomes, reduce abandonment rates, and boost cross-selling and upselling.
Besides supporting sales goals, the digital experience provided by a Conversational Marketing platform also enhances brand reputation. Customers feel more compelled to trust you and don’t hesitate to return for more queries.
Automotive retail must address rising expectations from the digital-first customer and competition from new mobility concepts. Even as markets in the United States, Europe, and China are trending downwards, Morgan Stanley forecasts a 4% fall in global auto production, which is expected to strain automakers’ and suppliers’ profits. In rethinking their business models to counter forces and sail through a weak economic climate, automakers are rejigging their marketing and sales strategies.
Although digital engagement cannot replicate the intimacy of face-to-face interaction at a dealership, it can ensure sufficiently enjoyable and educational one-to-one and one-to-many conversations that lead to test drives and sales. A Conversational Marketing platform in the automotive industry is a powerful solution that pre-qualifies, cross-sells, upsells and links customers in real-time to other retail channels, matching intent with the right suggestions and persuading quick action to drive up sales outcomes

we are only 28ft. above sea-level. Consequently the river’s course is very easily altered. Look at Stanford’s map of this region and see how the Euphrates has lost itself between Nasiriyah and Basra—“old channel,” “new channel,” creeks, marshes, lakes, flood-areas and so on; the place is a nightmare. That kind of thing is liable to happen anywhere if the river is neglected. So that our schemes for Lower Mesopotamia might be spoilt by the indolence of those in possession higher up the river: let alone the security of the trade-routes which would be at the mercy of wild Arabs if Turkey collapses.
All this inclines me more and more to believe that we shall be forced, sooner or later, to occupy the whole Mesopotamian plain as far as Mosul or to whatever point is the southern limit of Russian control. At first I favoured a “neutral zone” from Mosul to Kut, and I shouldn’t be surprised if that plan still finds favour at home. But frankly I see no prospect of a strong enough Government to make the neutral zone workable; on the contrary everything points to the absorption of the Persian neutral zone by either us or Russia, probably us.
I am still a Captain, but no longer a Coy. Commander. A large draft from India has arrived, 11 officers and 319 men from 1/4th and 2/4th, invalids returned. I am now second in command of a Coy. of respectable size.

ged photos and stories, meaning that brands now have access to information such as, reach, taps forward, taps backward, replies and exits. While the data on regular feed posts last forever, insight on stories will only last 14 days.
Okay, I Love It. So How Do I Set It Up?
As of now, Instagram is choosing the brands and influencers it rolls these new tools out to first. However, if you have a business account there is a good chance that Instagram has already offered this feature to you, and if they haven’t, rest assured it will be available soon!
Once approved to use this tool, follow this easy process to set it up!
Tagging Brands in Photos
- Select a photo like usual. Add a caption and any effects or filters you’d like then hit the next button.
- Once you’ve hit the next button you’re taken to a screen where you have the option to tag people, add a location, share to another social platform, or choose advanced settings. Tap advanced settings and then tap business partner.
- Once tapping the business partner option, search for the business you’d like to tag and select them to have them show up in your post.
Tagging Brands in Stories
- Starting from your Instagram feed, select the camera icon in the top left-hand corner of the screen to begin your story.
- Once you’ve taken the photo or video, tap the link icon in the top right-hand section of the screen.
- Next, the option to tag a business partner will appear in which you can then search for the business you’d like to select. Once selected the picture will then be tagged with “paid partnership with” when people view your story.
Both creators and businesses can require approval before being tagged in content, giving everyone full access to what they want their name and brand on.
To Set up Partner Approval
- First, go to your Instagram settings and select business settings.
- Under business settings tap “Branded content approvals”. Now you can either select the creators you’d like to approve or turn on the “require approval” toggle which will assure that you’ll be contacted each time you are tagged in a post.
How to View Insights From an Approved Influencer’s Post
- Go to your Facebook page and click on the insights tab.
- Once you’re in the insights tab, find the section where it says branded content and choose the influencers post which you’d like to view.
- From there you’ll be able to view insights in real time.
If you’re viewing from the business manager the process is a little different.
- First, you’ll want to go to the business manager and find the section that says measure and report.
- From measure and report click on branded content to view all of you insights.
Another noteworthy thing about this new Instagram feature is that as a brand and creator you can control who tags you in posts AND remove your brand from tagged brand content. Remove your brand from tagged content will take your brand name off of the post, however, the post will remain on Instagram and you will no longer have access to the post insights.
Now, What Does This Mean For Marketing?
So does this new feature mean the end of hashtags like #ad and #spon? Not exactly. We have to remember that Instagram has just rolled out this feature, and like all new tools, not all the bugs are worked out right away.
As a brand and creator, it’s important to talk with your team to make sure you are legally covered when posting content.
It is safe to say though, that this new tool is a huge step in reducing the confusion between sponsored and authentic Instagram posts and will provide marketers with even more powerful information to support their advertising efforts

Now they have reformed at a point, only twenty miles from ——, their present base. We shall go for them there no doubt, and push them back once more. But what does it all lead to? Imagine peace restored. What will Turkey be like? She will be bankrupt, chaotic, totally incapable of keeping order among these murderous Bedouins. The country would be a second Persia under her. Persia is intolerable enough for the Europeans who trade there at present: but the plight of this country might easily be worse. We are bound to control the bit from Basra to the sea to protect existing interests. The whole future of that area—as of all Mesopotamia—depends on a scientific scheme of drainage and irrigation. At present half the country is marsh and half desert. Why? Because under Turkish rule the river is never dredged, the banks are never repaired, stray Arabs can cut haphazard canals and leave them to form marshes, and so on. Now an irrigation and drainage scheme is vitally necessary, but (1) it involves a large outlay; (2) to be effective it must start a long way up-stream; (3) there must be security for the good government not only of the area included in the scheme, but of the whole course of the river above it. These Asiatic rivers are tricky things: they run for hundreds of miles through alluvial plains which are as flat as your hand. Here at Amarah, 200 miles from the mouth of the Tigris,

What new tagging system has Instagram introduced for sponsored posts, and why is it deemed beneficial for both creators and brands
------------correct----------------------
Lately, we’ve seen Instagram take the leap from a photo sharing platform to an advanced business tool for brands and influencers alike. Through Instagram, brands and creators are able to promote themselves, grow a following, and ultimately make a living doing what they love. Because of this, advertisements, sponsored posts, and branded content is flooding Instagram’s feed and while this may be beneficial to the brands involved, Instagram has made it clear that they want to keep sponsored content and authentic content separate.
Both Instagram and Facebook pride themselves in being user-friendly, non-salesy platforms and do their best to abide by traditional advertising rules.
Because of this, Instagram is stepping up its game and rolling out some new rules for branded stories and posts. Rules that if you’re an influencer, brand, or do any advertising at all you’ll want to take note of.
While these tools are directly designed to help Instagram users tell the difference between authentic and branded content, they are also extremely beneficial to businesses. It’s no doubt that Instagram’s new tools were designed with brands and creators in mind and they have features that are bound to change the advertising game.
As of now, in order to abide by Facebook’s advertising rules, Instagram has requested that Influencers use the hashtag #ad #sponsored or #spon on all posts that they are compensated for.
Not only does this rule protect influencers from taxes, but it also accomplishes Instagrams goal of separating ads from original content.
It’s no secret that many influencers aren’t in love with this rule as they feel it diminishes the value of their content as well as their credibility.
Before, when an influencer shared a product it seemed natural and authentic and their audience trusted the things they said. Now, even if the influencer is fond of a product, when they share the post with the hashtag #ad often times their audience doesn’t respond as well and believes that they are only endorsing the product because they are being compensated.
So What’s The New Tool?
Let me start by saying brands are going to love it! Basically, Instagram is kicking #ad to the curb and has come up with a way to abide by Facebook’s advertising rules and offer creators and brands something in return. Now, using their new tool an influencer has the ability to tag a brand in a sponsored post with a “Paid partnership with…” label appears above their photo. This new tag shows that the influencer is in a commercial relationship with the business partner that’s mentioned, and that they were compensated in some way for the post.
Okay, so why would creators and brands prefer this method over #ad? Here’s why – Not only does the new tag help sponsored posts look more professional and less spam-like, but it also simplifies the approval process between businesses and creators. What was before a long email chain back and forth between the two parties, has now been simplified into the tap of a button. And that’s not the only way it benefits both parties!
By turning on partner approvals, brands can approve a creator’s post once published allowing their tag to appear in the post. This approval process helps maintain brand quality and grants the brand access to the Instagram posts insights! Reach and engagement metrics along with other analytics are shared directly with the brand, allowing them to see these numbers on their Facebook page manager.
These insights will help brands assure that their getting their money’s worth and determine which influencers are most effective in their space. Metrics can be seen for both tag

Lately, we’ve seen Instagram take the leap from a photo sharing platform to an advanced business tool for brands and influencers alike. Through Instagram, brands and creators are able to promote themselves, grow a following, and ultimately make a living doing what they love. Because of this, advertisements, sponsored posts, and branded content is flooding Instagram’s feed and while this may be beneficial to the brands involved, Instagram has made it clear that they want to keep sponsored content and authentic content separate.
Both Instagram and Facebook pride themselves in being user-friendly, non-salesy platforms and do their best to abide by traditional advertising rules.
Because of this, Instagram is stepping up its game and rolling out some new rules for branded stories and posts. Rules that if you’re an influencer, brand, or do any advertising at all you’ll want to take note of.
While these tools are directly designed to help Instagram users tell the difference between authentic and branded content, they are also extremely beneficial to businesses. It’s no doubt that Instagram’s new tools were designed with brands and creators in mind and they have features that are bound to change the advertising game.

What do many researchers suggest is the most effective approach to fire protection in communities
------------correct----------------------
ander, March 9
… “It's not fair to say that fuel treatments won't do any good,” said Max Moritz, a UC Cooperative Extension wildfire specialist at UC Santa Barbara. “It may provide some protection in some places. But most of us studying this agree that you can't just do this and (expect to) make much headway.”
The plan by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, comes at the request of Gov. Gavin Newsom. On his second day in office, Newsom asked the agency to develop a proposal to address the increasingly destructive fire seasons that have rattled the state and are expected to worsen with climate change.
…In the meantime, many researchers say the most effective approach to fire protection is not in the forests, but in communities. They recommend making homes more resistant to fire with hardier construction materials, and clearing the vegetation around them.
“You have to address the home vulnerabilities themselves,” said Moritz at UC Santa Barbara. “If you don't, you're just not going to make a lot of progress on fire.”
After more than 140 years, a massive fig tree gracing the plaza where Los Angeles was founded collapses
(LA Times) Matthew Ormseth, March 9
… The four figs were planted at El Pueblo by agriculturalist and City Councilman Elijah Hook Workman, KCET reported in 2013. The Ficus macrophylla was brought from Australia to Southern California in the 1860s and 1870s, probably to provide shade and ornamentation, said Donald Hodel, a horticulture advisor for the University of California's Cooperative Extension.
Hodel described the Moreton Bay fig as a commanding breed of tree with an enveloping canopy that threw plenty of shade.
His reasons for admiring the Moreton Bay fig: “Their grandeur; their size — they have an imposing habit; their root structure is incredible; the spreading nature of their branches.”
Hodel said he last saw the El Pueblo figs about six years ago.
“I wasn't too impressed by their health or their size, considering they're 140-something years old,” he said.

4-H leader who taught lost Benbow girls outdoor skills being flown to Washington, DC for recognition
Kym Kemp, March 7
When Leia Carrico, age 8, and her sister, Caroline, age 5, disappeared into the woods around their home near Benbow on March 1, the whole nation held its breath for the next 44 hours until they were found. But, though their 4-H leaders were worried, too, they say they also knew the girls had something many other children don't–they had survival skills from a class taught by their Outdoor Adventures 4-H project leader, Justin Lehnert.
Lehnert is being honored in Washington, DC, on Tuesday for his role in teaching Leia and Caroline outdoor skills.
Researchers highlight plan to eat healthy on a budget
(Consumer Affairs) Kristen Dalli, March 7
Following a healthy diet can come with a hefty price tag, but a team of researchers has outlined a way for consumers to stick to a healthy diet -- and also stick to their budgets.
According to the team, consumers -- and their families -- can have healthy meals if they focus on buying items in bulk and planning meals in advance.
“This study determines the likelihood that families living in low-income households could create meals that meet the USDA dietary guidelines presented in MyPlate nutrition education materials,” said researcher Karen M. Jetter, PhD. “In addition to food cost, the other factors considered were access to stores, time for meal preparation, and whether the menus included culturally appropriate foods.”

Sorry, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, but “farting cows” aren't the problem
(New Food Economy) Sam Bloch, March 7
…As it turns out, neither side was accurate. Republicans are likely to continue linking Green New Deal priorities to a supposed hamburger ban. But if you don't hear about cow farts anymore from AOC, it may not be because of GOP criticism. Frank Mitloehner, an animal scientist and air quality specialist at the University of California, Davis, insists cattle flatulence isn't the problem it's made out to be, and says he helped set the record straight.
Here's what seems to have happened. On February 4, shortly before Ocasio-Cortez announced the Green New Deal, she was speaking to school children in Queens, New York. When one asked how they could “combat” climate change, Ocasio-Cortez offered two practical options—stop using disposable razors, and skip meat and dairy for one meal.
Mitloehner tweeted at her.
“Dear @AOC: we all try to help the climate,” he wrote. “However, the two options you offered have low impacts compared to the 800lb gorilla, which is to reduce fossil fuel use. About ? of greenhouse gas emissions in the US stem from transport and energy prod&use. Meat/milk = 4 % of total GHG,” referring to findings in a recent EPA report.
… “I give her team a lot of credit for reaching out,” Mitloehner says. “If we really are serious about making a difference in carbon emissions, you cannot do this without agriculture involved.”
California supplies a quarter of the world's sunflower seeds
(Capital Press) Padma Nagappan, March 7
…Khaled Bali is a University of California Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources statewide water and irrigation specialist who has been working since 2016 on a four-year trial on sunflower varieties.
He was asked by the University of Georgia to help ascertain which varieties were drought resistant. He chose to conduct his trial in the low desert region of the Imperial Valley, since it gets little rain during the growing season between February when it's planted, and June when it's harvested. This would make it easier to control and measure the actual water applied to the crop varieties.
“We're looking at 285 varieties of sunflowers, to see which ones do well under stress,” Bali said. He has tested different plantings each growing season for the past three years, and will finish the trial this year.
Livestream coverage of fire protection panel discussion in Nevada City

Bees, blooms off to slow start
(Western Farm Press) Logan Hawkes, March 6
…This year, almond bloom started around a normal time, with some early varieties showing a few open flowers in the first week of February,” reported Franz Niederholzer, UCCE farm advisor for Colusa, Sutter, and Yuba Counties. “For most of the month bloom progressed very slowly,”
By the middle of February, he says, “bloom for Nonpareil was at least two weeks behind, and bee hours were limited until the last week of the month. Last year, between Feb 1-20, we accumulated 130 bee hours of good honey bee flying weather [55 F., no rain, and wind less than 10 mph]. For the same interval this year, we had around 10 hours and only six of those occurred with open flowers

His reasons for admiring the Moreton Bay fig: “Their grandeur; their size — they have an imposing habit; their root structure is incredible; the spreading nature of their branches.”
Hodel said he last saw the El Pueblo figs about six years ago.
“I wasn't too impressed by their health or their size, considering they're 140-something years old,” he said.
California's 2018 Was the Worst Ever Recorded for Wildfires
(Gizmodo) Tom McKay, March 9
University of California, Santa Barbara UC Cooperative Extension wildfire researcher Max Moritiz told the Chronicle, “It's not fair to say that fuel treatments won't do any good. It may provide some protection in some places. But most of us studying this agree that you can't just do this and (expect to) make much headway.”
4-H leader who taught lost Benbow girls outdoor skills being flown to Washington, DC for recognition
Kym Kemp, March 7
When Leia Carrico, age 8, and her sister, Caroline, age 5, disappeared into the woods around their home near Benbow on March 1, the whole nation held its breath for the next 44 hours until they were found. But, though their 4-H leaders were worried, too, they say they also knew the girls had something many other children don't–they had survival skills from a class taught by their Outdoor Adventures 4-H project leader, Justin Lehnert.
Lehnert is being honored in Washington, DC, on Tuesday for his role in teaching Leia and Caroline outdoor skills.
Researchers highlight plan to eat healthy on a budget
(Consumer Affairs) Kristen Dalli, March 7
Following a healthy diet can come with a hefty price tag, but a team of researchers has outlined a way for consumers to stick to a healthy diet -- and also stick to their budgets.
According to the team, consumers -- and their families -- can have healthy meals if they focus on buying items in bulk and planning meals in advance.
“This study determines the likelihood that families living in low-income households could create meals that meet the USDA dietary guidelines presented in MyPlate nutrition education materials,” said researcher Karen M. Jetter, PhD. “In addition to food cost, the other factors considered were access to stores, time for meal preparation, and whether the menus included culturally appropriate foods.”

Sorry, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, but “farting cows” aren't the problem
(New Food Economy) Sam Bloch, March 7
…As it turns out, neither side was accurate. Republicans are likely to continue linking Green New Deal priorities to a supposed hamburger ban. But if you don't hear about cow farts anymore from AOC, it may not be because of GOP criticism. Frank Mitloehner, an animal scientist and air quality specialist at the University of California, Davis, insists cattle flatulence isn't the problem it's made out to be, and says he helped set the record straight.
Here's what seems to have happened. On February 4, shortly before Ocasio-Cortez announced the Green New Deal, she was speaking to school children in Queens, New York. When one asked how they could “combat” climate change, Ocasio-Cortez offered two practical options—stop using disposable razors, and skip meat and dairy for one meal.
Mitloehner tweeted at her.
“Dear @AOC: we all try to help the climate,” he wrote. “However, the two options you offered have low impacts compared to the 800lb gorilla, which is to reduce fossil fuel use. About ? of greenhouse gas emissions in the US stem from transport and energy prod&use. Meat/milk = 4 % of total GHG,” referring to findings in a recent EPA report.
… “I give her team a lot of credit for reaching out,” Mitloehner says. “If we really are serious about making a difference in carbon emissions, you cannot do this without agriculture involved.”
California supplies a quarter of the world's sunflower seeds
(Capital Press) Padma Nagappan, March 7
…Khaled Bali is a University of California Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources statewide water and irrigation specialist who has been working since 2016 on a four-year trial on sunflower varieties.
He was asked by the University of Georgia to help ascertain which varieties were drought resistant. He chose to conduct his trial in the low desert region of the Imperial Valley, since it gets little rain during the growing season between February when it's planted, and June when it's harvested. This would make it easier to control and measure the actual water applied to the crop varieties.
“We're looking at 285 varieties of sunflowers, to see which ones do well under stress,” Bali said. He has tested different plantings each growing season for the past three years, and will finish the trial this year.

Bees, blooms off to slow start
(Western Farm Press) Logan Hawkes, March 6
…This year, almond bloom started around a normal time, with some early varieties showing a few open flowers in the first week of February,” reported Franz Niederholzer, UCCE farm advisor for Colusa, Sutter, and Yuba Counties. “For most of the month bloom progressed very slowly,”
By the middle of February, he says, “bloom for Nonpareil was at least two weeks behind, and bee hours were limited until the last week of the month. Last year, between Feb 1-20, we accumulated 130 bee hours of good honey bee flying weather [55 F., no rain, and wind less than 10 mph]. For the same interval this year, we had around 10 hours and only six of those occurred with open flowers

------------answer-----------------------
Two forces are shaping the future of automotive retail. One is competition from new mobility concepts: ride-sharing, electric vehicles, and a growing preference for used cars (as studies in the U.S. and Indian markets suggest). The other is the customer trend of accessing vehicle information across media and devices. 73% of new car buyers use digital channels to research their next purchase, with this figure expected to soar in the coming years.
Digital is a starting point in the vehicle purchase journey. An engaging digital experience is a new imperative in automotive retail. The challenge is delivering it!
Increasing vehicle complexity means customers need more assistance than before
As automotive manufacturer attempt to engineer more advanced vehicles that provide better fuel economy and increased safety, marketing and sales face the issue of explaining new features effectively.
In a dealership setting, there is more scope to gain clarity around an innovative active safety system or construction material. Representatives can answer buyers’ queries, and have a back and forth about specs of importance to the buyer. This human experience is unavailable when a screen comes between consumers and sales, and it has come into sharper focus with the rollout of complex vehicles.
The digital experience must evolve for car buyers to really understand the vehicle they’re interested in.
While it may not be possible to match the experience of visiting a dealership, an effective auto retail strategy can be a springboard to a sale by providing information buyer wants to know and see to make an informed decision.
‘Personalized, anywhere, any-time’ is the new mantra
Given that most consumer-brand interactions are occurring online, there is a renewed focus in improving the digital experience. Auto brands understand perfectly well that buyers want personalized content and interactivity. Omni-channel retail is a direct consequence, with automakers on a quest to ensure a seamless experience at all points of the customer lifecycle.
Auto retail leaders have started adopting new approaches to online sales that are pre-qualifying leads and generating sales at a faster pace than the more ‘conventional’ digital sales strategies.
Redefining the drab auto customer experience
The automotive customer experience can feel outdated and inferior, particularly to younger customers. As buying a car has practical and aspirational dimensions, auto brands who create desire around their products and confidence in their customer service are better positioned to grow sales. And the convenience offered by digital engagement is available to leverage – 32.1% of consumers watch at least 1-2 hours of video a week and 68% of customers would prefer to learn about a product or service via video.
Car buying is an exciting experience when buyers step behind the wheels of their test-drive model. However, choosing which cars to test drive (as serious buyers do) isn’t so much fun. The time has come to move on from car images and pre-recorded top speed testing videos. Buyers want an up, close and personal retail experience through their mobile phones and tablets, as well as a highly tailored service experience.
A conversational approach to boost sales
Conversational Marketing is a dialogue-driven approach to online sales, based on the principle of only selling to customers wh

ar as well as anyone. He also knows just how good Saban is, and he wants no part of being remembered as the AD who somehow let him slip away.
Kentucky coach Mitch Barnhart likely travels that same path with basketball coach John Calipari, who's reached three Final Fours and won one national title during his five years in Lexington. Does Barnhart privately believe Coach Cal's worth the $5.4 million he made this past season? Probably not. Yet he's smart enough to know that having once hired the disaster that was Billy Clyde Gillispie, he better pay Cal whatever he wants whenever he wants it.
And given that passion for winning at any cost, what Southern major college president at a school best known for an athletic program would ever want to stand up to that program's coach over principles and priorities?
To repeat an old line once attributed to the University of Oklahoma president during the school's football superiority of the 1950s: "We just hope to have a university to make the football team proud."
There is also a flip side to this that every Alabama fan should be justifiably proud of, however wrongheaded this all looks. Thanks mostly to football, the Tide athletic department ran $34 million in the black during the 2012-13 school year and returned $6.5 million to the academic side of UA. So it basically paid for $aban's whole salary. Similar numbers should arrive for this year.
Nor does Saban apparently mind subliminally assessing blame for last year where he believes it's justified. While all of his assistants received contract extensions through February of 2016, only wideouts coach Billy Napier (from Murray County, Ga.) received no increase in pay. Better dip into your pocket for more sticky gloves, Billy. Need more sticky gloves.
So here we go again down here in SEC country, where three of the nation's six highest paid coaches -- Saban (1), Texas A&M's Kevin Sumlin (3) and LSU's Les Miles (6) -- make most of the rest of the coaching community green with envy.
Yet while we pour hundreds of millions into renovating already lavish football stadiums, pay the coaches whatever they want while often freezing faculty pay and hike tuition by 8 percent or more, we might also pause to wonder why a story on our website Tuesday afternoon declared that six of the 10 dumbest states in America based on percent of the population with a bachelor's degree, median household income and 2010 average SAT score were home to SEC schools, including Alabama at No. 7 and Tennessee in 10th.
The smartest state in America by those criteria was Massachusetts. Coincidence or not, the Minutemen's new coach, Mark Whipple, will earn a base salary of $250,000 this fall.

gel [Hernandez] denied [Derek] Jeter a timeout?" Pedroia asked. "Ridiculous."
The three games of the series lasted 3 hours and 46 minutes, 3:48 and 3:21 (10 innings), respectively.
Yankees closer Mariano Rivera was equally peeved at West's comments, telling ESPN.com, "If he has places to go, let him do something else. What does he want us to do, swing at balls?"
Red Sox manager Terry Francona, when asked about West's controversial comments, was careful to be a bit more diplomatic.
"Obviously, I think I need to be somewhat careful is the right word, selective,'' Francona told the Web site. "I mean, I think it kind of surprised all of us. When you have somebody in charge of running the game without bias, and then you hear those comments coming out pretty strong, it probably worries you a little bit.''
But Francona doesn't necessarily believe that nothing needs to change about the length of these games.
"They always have been [too long], and are probably always gonna be,'' he said. "I've had 20 knee surgeries. I'm not jogging to the mound. I can't do it. It hurts.''

Civilians march for peace in the Central African RepublicDec 19, 2013
United Nations field representatives joined a youth-led march for peace this morning in Bangui, the capital. “We want to express our desire to restore the harmony that has always existed between Christians and Muslims in this country,” a participant said.
Since 5 December 2013, the outbreak of violence in the capital has claimed over 500 lives and displaced about 200,000 others. According to the latest reports, an average of three people per hour were victims of fighting during the second week of December alone.
In response to the situation, UNDP Administrator Helen Clark expressed her concern for the security situation in Central African Republic and has called for an immediate halt to the violence. “We hope that the situation stabilizes very quickly so that UNDP can resume its work to support lasting peace here,” said Helen Clark.
With a presence in the country since 1976, UNDP has worked in a complex and fragile context to support CAR in the areas of governance, poverty reduction and combating HIV/AIDS.
However, the takeover in March 2013 by the Seleka rebels forced the United Nations System to suspend implementation of its 2012–2016 country programme and

What is the name of the album that features the orchestral track 'Shred I. Multiverse' by OBLIVION
------------correct----------------------
The orchestral track "Shred I. Multiverse" from San Francisco Bay Area "blackened, technical post-death metallers" OBLIVION, who feature in their ranks former ALL SHALL PERISH guitarist Ben Orum on bass, can be streamed in the YouTube clip below. The song is one of three bonus tracks on OBLIVION's new album, "Called To Rise", which was released on January 1.
Commented OBLIVION vocalist Nick Vasallo: "As a band, OBLIVION doesn't want to just fit into the typical death metal category. Sure, we come from primarily a death metal background and we fulfill all the stylistic criteria associated with it. But we want our music to have broad conceptions and extreme depth.
"I composed a piece called 'Multiverse' that exists within two universes: metal and classical. The notes are identical and the music functions both as modern art music and modern extreme metal. We hired some of the top string players in the Bay Area to perform the work and recorded video of the sessions.
"One of the aspects that I want to bring from the metal world into the classical is the physical embodiment of the music. Notice how the musicians are almost obligated to move their bodies and headbang to the music in order to rhythmically play it.
"'Shred' is very rhythmic and, like a metal musician, requires total physical involvement with the music.

Lately, we’ve seen Instagram take the leap from a photo sharing platform to an advanced business tool for brands and influencers alike. Through Instagram, brands and creators are able to promote themselves, grow a following, and ultimately make a living doing what they love. Because of this, advertisements, sponsored posts, and branded content is flooding Instagram’s feed and while this may be beneficial to the brands involved, Instagram has made it clear that they want to keep sponsored content and authentic content separate.
Both Instagram and Facebook pride themselves in being user-friendly, non-salesy platforms and do their best to abide by traditional advertising rules.
Because of this, Instagram is stepping up its game and rolling out some new rules for branded stories and posts. Rules that if you’re an influencer, brand, or do any advertising at all you’ll want to take note of.
While these tools are directly designed to help Instagram users tell the difference between authentic and branded content, they are also extremely beneficial to businesses. It’s no doubt that Instagram’s new tools were designed with brands and creators in mind and they have features that are bound to change the advertising game.
As of now, in order to abide by Facebook’s advertising rules, Instagram has requested that Influencers use the hashtag #ad #sponsored or #spon on all posts that they are compensated for.
Not only does this rule protect influencers from taxes, but it also accomplishes Instagrams goal of separating ads from original content.
It’s no secret that many influencers aren’t in love with this rule as they feel it diminishes the value of their content as well as their credibility.
Before, when an influencer shared a product it seemed natural and authentic and their audience trusted the things they said. Now, even if the influencer is fond of a product, when they share the post with the hashtag #ad often times their audience doesn’t respond as well and believes that they are only endorsing the product because they are being compensated.
So What’s The New Tool?
Let me start by saying brands are going to love it! Basically, Instagram is kicking #ad to the curb and has come up with a way to abide by Facebook’s advertising rules and offer creators and brands something in return. Now, using their new tool an influencer has the ability to tag a brand in a sponsored post with a “Paid partnership with…” label appears above their photo. This new tag shows that the influencer is in a commercial relationship with the business partner that’s mentioned, and that they were compensated in some way for the post.
Okay, so why would creators and brands prefer this method over #ad? Here’s why – Not only does the new tag help sponsored posts look more professional and less spam-like, but it also simplifies the approval process between businesses and creators. What was before a long email chain back and forth between the two parties, has now been simplified into the tap of a button. And that’s not the only way it benefits both parties!
By turning on partner approvals, brands can approve a creator’s post once published allowing their tag to appear in the post. This approval process helps maintain brand quality and grants the brand access to the Instagram posts insights! Reach and engagement metrics along with other analytics are shared directly with the brand, allowing them to see these numbers on their Facebook page manager.
These insights will help brands assure that their getting their money’s worth and determine which influencers are most effective in their space. Metrics can be seen for both tag

What did Joe West complain about regarding the Yankees and the Red Sox games
------------correct----------------------
"To call the Yankees and the Red Sox, two of the best teams in baseball, 'pathetic' and 'embarrassing,' that's just ridiculous," Pedroia told ESPN.com on Friday. "If he doesn't want to do Red Sox and Yankee games, he should tell the umpires' union. Then when we're in the World Series, he'll be out of that assignment, too."
Joe West complained after the conclusion of the Boston-New York series earlier this week that the games are running too long. The umpire has been in the major leagues for 32 years and has worked over 4,000 games.
"They're the two clubs that don't try to pick up the pace," West told the Bergen Record on Wednesday. "They're two of the best teams in baseball. Why are they playing the slowest? It's pathetic and embarrassing. They take too long to play.''
Now it appears that West could be penalized for his brash comments, as sources told ESPN.com's Wallace Matthews that the crew chief is likely to be reprimanded.
According to Pedroia, it was quite obvious that the umpiring crew was dissatisfied with the rate of play.

What competition dynamics are observed in the DRTV space between established brands like Proactiv Solution and new products like Neutrogena skin iD
------------correct----------------------
DR Winners Draw Branders Into Competition1 May, 2009 By: Thomas Haire Response
Brand marketers' expansion into the DRTV space during the past decade has been well documented. Perhaps no two verticals have been more affected by this change than the beauty-and-personal-care space and the housewares market.
Whether it is a direct attack — think Neutrogena's direct attack on Proactiv Solution with its new skin iD product in 2008 — or an attempt by a major conglomerate to capitalize on a new market created by a hot direct response product, today's branders can't seem to get enough of the opportunities that await them in DRTV.
Opportunity doesn't necessarily breed success, however. Here's a look at four different cases of products from brand marketers created and designed to take on DRTV champions in recent years.
Proactiv Solution vs. Neutrogena skin iD
According to Guthy-Renker Corp.'s Web site, www.proactiv.com, "Instead of treating one pimple at a time, the Proactiv system was developed to treat your whole face and help prevent acne before it starts. That's the Proactiv difference. With just three simple steps a day, you can stop the suffering and start living with the clear, radiant complexion you've always wanted."

As I shared with my readers earlier in the month, big changes were happening in my life. So, now I am confident I can share these changes with you.
I have worked for a great company over the last 16 years and truly imagined that I would still be at that company when I reached official retirement age(which is still quite a way off). After struggling with several medical issues that cause my body great pain and difficult in walking and moving, I started praying earnestly asking the Lord to lead me and guide me in making the decision to stay or leave.
I know that I made the right decision to resign earlier than planned. I have HIS peace and for the first time realize that having a paycheck isn’t all there is to life. I realize we all have bills to pay and yes, we need money to survive; but when you make budget cuts and rearrange your budget, you can do it. Am I scared? I can confidently say I have no fear. Which if you knew me

------------question-----------------------
What unprecedented recovery did Alabama's football coach Nick Saban receive after facing a two-game losing streak, and how does this compare to former coaches like Mike DuBose and Mike Shula
------------correct----------------------
Only Nick Saban could turn a two-game losing streak into a $1-million-a-year raise.
And one of those losses was a come-from-ahead collapse against archenemy Auburn that had over-coaching written all over it.
Former Alabama coaches such as Mike DuBose or Mike Shula -- maybe that's Saban's saving grace; he isn't named Mike -- would have been fired before they could have reached the locker room if their teams had given up 13 points to the Tigers in the final 34 seconds.
Instead, the Alabama brass gave Saban a contract extension through 2022 and a $1 million raise to a preposterous $6.5 million a year. Never mind that within the narrow confines of major college football, $aint Nick is probably worth it. At least as long as he finally beats a ranked Auburn team when they meet again this season.
Because for all of Saban's success, that's never happened. He's 0-6 against Tigers teams that finished seasons with at least nine wins.
When Bill Curry went 0-3 against Auburn as the Tide coach in the late 1980s, he fled for the calamity that was Kentucky before his fourth season in T-town rather than have one more brick thrown through his office window for disappointing Houndstooth Nation.
But $aban gets a $1 million raise and extension after collapsing at Auburn, then getting outcoached and his Tide outplayed by Oklahoma in the Sugar Bowl. Poor OU coach Bob Stoops. He's still under $4.8 million per year (at least as of press time Tuesday night).
And what of Auburn coach Gus Malzahn, whose magical, maniacal offense has now bettered Saban two of the past four seasons? Should the Tigers again trip the Tide this autumn in Tuscaloosa, does Malzahn's $3.85 million deal escalate by $1 million a year?

Only Nick Saban could turn a two-game losing streak into a $1-million-a-year raise.
And one of those losses was a come-from-ahead collapse against archenemy Auburn that had over-coaching written all over it.
Former Alabama coaches such as Mike DuBose or Mike Shula -- maybe that's Saban's saving grace; he isn't named Mike -- would have been fired before they could have reached the locker room if their teams had given up 13 points to the Tigers in the final 34 seconds.
Instead, the Alabama brass gave Saban a contract extension through 2022 and a $1 million raise to a preposterous $6.5 million a year. Never mind that within the narrow confines of major college football, $aint Nick is probably worth it. At least as long as he finally beats a ranked Auburn team when they meet again this season.
Because for all of Saban's success, that's never happened. He's 0-6 against Tigers teams that finished seasons with at least nine wins.
When Bill Curry went 0-3 against Auburn as the Tide coach in the late 1980s, he fled for the calamity that was Kentucky before his fourth season in T-town rather than have one more brick thrown through his office window for disappointing Houndstooth Nation.
But $aban gets a $1 million raise and extension after collapsing at Auburn, then getting outcoached and his Tide outplayed by Oklahoma in the Sugar Bowl. Poor OU coach Bob Stoops. He's still under $4.8 million per year (at least as of press time Tuesday night).
And what of Auburn coach Gus Malzahn, whose magical, maniacal offense has now bettered Saban two of the past four seasons? Should the Tigers again trip the Tide this autumn in Tuscaloosa, does Malzahn's $3.85 million deal escalate by $1 million a year? And shouldn't it, at least as long he can also grab his first official national championship? Technically, he was only the offensive coordinator when AU won it all in 2010 for since-fired Gene Chizik.

Orum announced his departure from ALL SHALL PERISH last month, explaining in statement that he "could not fulfill [his] duty as a touring musician any longer" due to the fact that he needed to provide for his family. He added: "While I am done with touring, I will never stop writing music. I am joining the extreme metal band OBLIVION as a bassist and contributing songwriter. We are beyond excited to unleash [our debut album] onto the metal world. I've always been into death metal and extreme music, [and] this is my return to true death metal."

Civilians march for peace in the Central African RepublicDec 19, 2013
United Nations field representatives joined a youth-led march for peace this morning in Bangui, the capital. “We want to express our desire to restore the harmony that has always existed between Christians and Muslims in this country,” a participant said.
Since 5 December 2013, the outbreak of violence in the capital has claimed over 500 lives and displaced about 200,000 others. According to the latest reports, an average of three people per hour were victims of fighting during the second week of December alone.
In response to the situation, UNDP Administrator Helen Clark expressed her concern for the security situation in Central African Republic and has called for an immediate halt to the violence. “We hope that the situation stabilizes very quickly so that UNDP can resume its work to support lasting peace here,” said Helen Clark.
With a presence in the country since 1976, UNDP has worked in a complex and fragile context to support CAR in the areas of governance, poverty reduction and combating HIV/AIDS.

What two forces are influencing the future of automotive retail according to the text
------------correct----------------------
Two forces are shaping the future of automotive retail. One is competition from new mobility concepts: ride-sharing, electric vehicles, and a growing preference for used cars (as studies in the U.S. and Indian markets suggest). The other is the customer trend of accessing vehicle information across media and devices. 73% of new car buyers use digital channels to research their next purchase, with this figure expected to soar in the coming years.
Digital is a starting point in the vehicle purchase journey. An engaging digital experience is a new imperative in automotive retail. The challenge is delivering it!
Increasing vehicle complexity means customers need more assistance than before
As automotive manufacturer attempt to engineer more advanced vehicles that provide better fuel economy and increased safety, marketing and sales face the issue of explaining new features effectively.
In a dealership setting, there is more scope to gain clarity around an innovative active safety system or construction material. Representatives can answer buyers’ queries, and have a back and forth about specs of importance to the buyer. This human experience is unavailable when a screen comes between consumers and sales, and it has come into sharper focus with the rollout of complex vehicles.
The digital experience must evolve for car buyers to really understand the vehicle they’re interested in.
While it may not be possible to match the experience of visiting a dealership, an effective auto retail strategy can be a springboard to a sale by providing information buyer wants to know and see to make an informed decision.
‘Personalized, anywhere, any-time’ is the new mantra
Given that most consumer-brand interactions are occurring online, there is a renewed focus in improving the digital experience. Auto brands understand perfectly well that buyers want personalized content and interactivity. Omni-channel retail is a direct consequence, with automakers on a quest to ensure a seamless experience at all points of the customer lifecycle.
Auto retail leaders have started adopting new approaches to online sales that are pre-qualifying leads and generating sales at a faster pace than the more ‘conventional’ digital sales strategies.
Redefining the drab auto customer experience
The automotive customer experience can feel outdated and inferior, particularly to younger customers. As buying a car has practical and aspirational dimensions, auto brands who create desire around their products and confidence in their customer service are better positioned to grow sales. And the convenience offered by digital engagement is available to leverage – 32.1% of consumers watch at least 1-2 hours of video a week and 68% of customers would prefer to learn about a product or service via video.
Car buying is an exciting experience when buyers step behind the wheels of their test-drive model. However, choosing which cars to test drive (as serious buyers do) isn’t so much fun. The time has come to move on from car images and pre-recorded top speed testing videos. Buyers want an up, close and personal retail experience through their mobile phones and tablets, as well as a highly tailored service experience.

What was the reason for the bill filed against David E. Thompson concerning the Capital National Bank
------------correct----------------------
JOHN W. McDONALD, Receiver, etc., v. DAVID E. THOMPSON.
184 U.S. 71 (22 S.Ct. 297, 46 L.Ed. 437)
JOHN W. McDONALD, Receiver, etc., Appt. v. DAVID E. THOMPSON.
Argued: January 13, 14, 1902.
Decided: February 3, 1902.
- opinion, Brown [HTML]
This was a bill in equity originally filed May 20, 1898, in the circuit court for the district of Nebraska, by Kent K. Hayden, receiver of the Capital National Bank of Lincoln, Nebraska (of whom the present appelant is the successor in office), against David E. Thompson, to recover defendant's proportion of an assessment upon the stockholders of the bank to the amount of the par value of their shares. The bank failed on January 23, 1893, and a receiver was shortly thereafter appointed. On June 10, 1893, the Comptroller of the Currency ordered the assessment, which was made payable July 10, 1893.
The bill alleged Thompson to have been the owner of 210 shares of the capital stock, which he had acquired upon subscription to such stock and as a part of the original issue; that he, knowing the bank to be in a failing condition and practically insolvent, and in anticipation of its approaching failure, had sold and caused such stock to be transferred to certain irresponsible parties, and that such transfer was made with intent to defraud the bank, its depositors and creditors.
Defendant demurred upon the ground that it appeared by the bill that the cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations. The demurrer was sustained, the bill amended, another demurrer interposed and sustained, and the bill dismissed. An appeal was taken to the circuit court of appeals, which affirmed the judgment of the circuit court.
Messrs. J. R. Webster, John H. Ames, and Andrew E. Harvey for appellant.
Messrs. Halleck F. Rose and C. E. Magoon for appellee.
Mr. Justice Brown delivered the opinion of the court:
This bill is founded upon Rev. Stat. § 5151, which declares that 'the shareholders of every national banking association shall be held individually responsible, equally and ratably, and not one for another, for all contracts, debts, and engagements of such association, to the extent of the amount of their stock therein at the par value thereof, in addition to the amount invested in such shares,' etc. By § 5234 the Comptroller of the Currency is authorized to appoint a receiver of insolvent banks, who 'may, if necessary to pay the debts of such association, enforce the individual liability of the stockholders.'
The case turns upon the applicability of the state statute of limitations, which, so far as it is material, reads as follows:
'Sec. 5. Civil actions can only be commenced within the time prescribed in this title after the cause of action shall have accrued.
'Sec. 10. Within five years, an action upon a specialty, or any agreement, contract, or promise in writing, or foreign judgment.
'Sec. 11. Within four years, an action upon a contract not in writing, express or implied; an action upon a liability created by statute other than a forfeiture or penalty.'
As the cause of action in this case accrued on July 10, 1893, when the assessment was made payable (Hawkins v. Glenn, 131 U. S. 319, 33 L. ed. 184, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 739; Glenn v. Marbury, 145 U. S. 499, 36 L. ed. 790, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 914; Thompson v. German Ins. Co. 76 Fed. 892; Van Pelt v. Gardner, 54 Neb. 701, 74 N. W. 1083, 75 N. W. 874), and the action was begun on May 20, 1898, more than four but less than five years thereafter, the case really turns upon the question whether the action is upon a 'contract or promise in writing,' or 'upon a contract not in writing, express or implied,' or 'upon a liability created by statute.' If the cause of action be upon a written contract, the action was brought in time. If upon a contract not in writing, or a statutory liability, the statute of limitations is a complete bar.
Used in this connection and as distinguished from a contract not in writing, express or implied, we think it entirely clear that § 10 contemplates an action between the immediate parties or their privies to a written contract, and that the only contract covered by that definition in this case is the one arising from the allegation of the bill that Thompson was the owner of 210 shares of the original capital stock, and 'that he acquired the same upon subscription to such capital stock,' and by a receipt of certificates for such shares. The only contract to be gathered from this allegation is one between the bank on the one hand and the defendant on the other, by which the latter agreed to take and pay for a certain number of shares, and the former agreed to issue certificates to him for the same. Had the action been brought upon this contract,as, for instance, by the bank to recover an unpaid assessment upon the original shares,the case would have fallen within § 10, and the suit might have been brought within five years.
But there was no contract in writing with the creditors or depositors of the bank, and none with the bank itself, to which the receiver could be said to be a privy, except to pay for the stock as originally issued. Granting there was a contract with the creditors to pay a sum equal to the value of the stock taken, in addition to the sum invested in the shares, this was a contract created by the statute, and obligatory upon the stockholders by reason of the statute existing at the time of their subscription; but it was not a contract in writing within the meaning of the Nebraska act, since the writingthat is, the subscription contained no reference whatever to the statutory obligation and no promise to respond beyond the amount of the subscription. In none of the numerous cases upon the subject in this court is this obligation treated as an express contract, but as one created by the statute and implied from the express contract of the stockholders to take and pay for shares in the association. Carrol v. Green, 92 U. S. 509, 512, 23 L. ed. 738, 739; Terry v. Little, 101 U. S. 216, 25 L. ed. 864; First Nat. Bank v. Hawkins, 174 U. S. 364, 43 L. ed. 1007, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 739; Matteson v. Dent, 176 U. S. 521, 44 L. ed. 571, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 419; Whitman v. National Bank, 176 U. S. 559, 44 L. ed. 587, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 477.
While § 10 does not use the words 'express contract,' but the words 'contract or promise in writing,' we think that, taken in connection with § 11, which is confined to contracts not in writing, express or implied, express contracts are primarily and principally intended by the earlier section.

What distinguishes explicit contracts from implied contracts according to the text
------------correct----------------------
These are defined to be those contracts in which the terms of the agreement are fully and openly incorporated at the time the contract is entered into, while implied contracts are such as arise by legal inference and upon principles of reason and justice from certain facts, or where there is circumstantial evidence showing that the parties intended to make a contract. 2 Bl. Com. 443. As contracts for subscription to stock contain no stipulation with reference to the rights of creditors and depositors, it is clear that such rights can only be asserted upon the theory that the subscriber impliedly bound himself to respond to any liability arising indirectly from his contract of subscription.
Whether the promise raised by the statute was an implied contract not in writing or a liability created by statute, it is immaterial to inquire. For the purposes of this case it may have been both. The statute was the origin both of the right and the remedy, but the contract was the origin of the personal responsibility of the defendant. Did the statute make a distinction between them with reference to the time within which an action must be brought, it might be necessary to make a more exact definition; but as the action must be brought in any case within four years, it is unnecessary to go farther than to declare what seems entirely clear to us, that it is not a contract in writing within the meaning of § 10 of the Nebraska act. Hawkins v. Iron Valley Furnace Co. 40 Ohio St. 507.
Plaintiff, however, insists that defendant's contract here sought to be enforced was not entered into between him and the bank, but between him and the creditors of the bank; that the order of the Comptroller of the Currency for the assessment of the shareholders did not create a cause of action or set the statute of limitations running, nor in any way affect the validity or duration of the right which belongs to the creditors to have this liability enforced; and that the action not being upon the contract of subscription, but upon the contract of the shareholder with the creditors of the bank, entered into by himself with the creditors through the agency of the officers of the bank, different considerations apply, and the statute of limitations does not operate as a bar so long as there are any outstanding claims against the bank.
In support of this proposition we are referred to § 2 of the act of June 30, 1876 (19 Stat. at L. 63, chap. 156), which declares 'that when any national banking association shall have gone into liquidation under the provisions of § 5220 of said Revised Statutes, the individual liability of the shareholders provided for by § 5151 of said Statutes may be enforced by any creditor of such association, by bill in equity in the nature of a creditors' bill, brought by such creditor on behalf of himself and of all other creditors of the association against the shareholders thereof,' etc.; and we are cited to several cases holding that claims against shareholders under similar statutes do not become barred until the expiration of the time at which the claims against the corporation also became barred.
There are several answers to this position. Section 5220, to which the 2d section of the act of June 30, 1876, is supplementary, contemplates only a voluntary liquidation, providing, as it does, that 'any association may go into liquidation and be closed by the vote of its shareholders owning two thirds of its stock.' Richmond v. Irons, 121 U. S. 27, 47, 30 L. ed. 864, 870, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 788, 797. Now, the Capital National Bank did not go into voluntary liquidation, but, as averred in the bill, 'the Comptroller of the Currency of the United States became and was satisfied of the insolvency of the said Capital National Banking Association,' and thereupon appointed a receiver. In other words, the proceedings were taken under § 5234 as supplemented by § 1 of the act of June 30, 1876, authorizing the Comptroller of the Currency to appoint a receiver when the association had refused to pay its circulating notes and is in default, or he is otherwise satisfied of its insolvency.
But it is also sufficient to say of this that the action is not brought by the creditors under the 2d section of the act of June 30, 1876, but by the receiver under Rev. Stat. § 5234. In such cases no debt becomes due to the receiver as such until a deficiency has been ascertained and an assessment made, when the statute begins to run. Scovill v. Thayer, 105 U. S. 145, 26 L. ed. 968; Hawkins v. Glenn, 131 U. S. 319, 33 L. ed. 184, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 739. Upon the theory of the plaintiff, if the statute of limitations were pleaded, it would become necessary for the receiver to show that there were outstanding claims against the bank which were not barred by the statute, and therefore that the bill might be maintained. This would involve a departure from the whole theory of the bill in this case, which is based upon the allegation that the Comptroller of the Currency made an assessment upon the stockholders June 10, 1893, payable July 10, from which latter date plaintiff claimed interest. Defendant demurred to this upon the ground that the bill set forth a cause of action barred by the statute, and plaintiff went to a hearing upon this demurrer and was defeated. Obviously he cannot now set up a right to recover, if the creditors had brought a bill under another statute, to which no allusion is made in the bill in this case, and which provides for a wholly separate and independent remedy.
Plaintiff's final contention, that no cause of action arises until a demand has been made, is also fully met by the allegation of the bill that on June 10, 1893, the Comptroller of the Currency made an order in which he declared that he had made an assessment and requisition upon the shareholders, 'and that he did thereby make demand upon each and every share of the capital stock of the said association,' and directed the receiver to take proceedings by suit to enforce the individual liability of the shareholders. Having made this allegation himself, we do not understand upon what theory the plaintiff now assumes that no demand was made.
In the view we take of the statute of limitations, we have not thought it worth while to consider the points made by the defendant, that the action should have been at law, and that the bill is defective for the want of proper parties.
There was no error in the decree of the court below, and it is therefore affirmed.

In other Spanish-related news, Marca reports that Sevilla have offered 6m Euros for Jordan Amavi, a player who admitted he was looking to leave Villa Park in the summer. Villa who paid around 2m Euros more than that, when signing him, will hope to at least get their money back on any deal.
Other clubs interested in Amavi allegedly include: Monaco, Atletico Madrid and PSG.
Certainly this is one that will hot up in the coming days and Amavi might be one of the first out-going players, when the window opens.
MOMS has recently seen a couple of ‘Glenn Whelan Update’ headline stories on the Birmingham Mail site, yet the stories carried zero actual new information on the situation. It’s still, as is. Villa have reportedly offered £500,000 and Stoke want more for the 33-year-old midfielder. That’s still, the latest!
If there’s one thing MOMS has lamented over the seasons and that’s some Villa fans having revisionist longing for ex-players. Players that they were happy to see leave, but suddenly are considered as the answer to the team’s problems, for no reason other than some goldfish memory sentimentality.
Case in point, Stewart Downing. Villa bought Downing when he was on crutches, still recovering from a broken leg. Villa showed him a lot of good faith in being patient and helping him rehabilitate. Thus, when he went to Liverpool, two years later, after a U-turn of pledging his future to Villa, he was public enemy number one.
Regardless of that, Downing turns 33 next month, making him another older player (along with Whelan and Terry) looking for decent wages, but only offering a short-term solution.
One, or maybe two, of these players is feasible, but it’s dead money, if no promotion is achieved.
In the case of the left-wing position, it’s preferable to give Andre Green the starting berth, as this would be the perfect division to really blood him in and inject Villa with some pace.
Beard Number Two
Wales international Joe Ledley is meant to be on the radar of various Championship clubs, after being released by Crystal Palace. Villa have been mentioned in the mix for the midfielder, but considering the recruitment last season in the midfield department, it doesn’t seem too likely that Ledley would be a priority.
Whilst there are of course Welsh teammates in the Villa set-up to help bend his ear, the reality is the player would prefer to stay in the Premier League, if possible.

Pandemic And Wildfire: California Is Preparing For A Crisis Within A Crisis
(CapRadio) Ezra David Romero, April 15
…To protect human health, prescribed burns are not allowed for the time being on Forest Service land. But Ryan Tompkins, a forest advisor with the UC Cooperative Extension for Plumas, Sierra, and Lassen counties, says it's still early enough to prepare for wildfire with other tools like thinning and in some cases burning.
“It is really difficult because of the concerns about smoke and COVID, but sort of now is our chance to be prepared,” said Tompkins.
…“We know the agencies are going to have maybe limited capacity, limited resources, they're going to have other strains on their organizations while dealing with this crisis,” Tompkins said. “So, I think it emphasizes in a silver lining way that we all have a piece to play or a role to play.”
Susie Kocher, a forest adviser for the Lake Tahoe region with the UC Cooperative Extension, is concerned about a triple threat of COVID-19, wildfires, and power shutoffs.
“These two potential situations just could stack on top of the uncertainty of what people need to do,” she said.

New fungicide approved for Calif. tree nuts

… University of California, Riverside plant pathologist Jim Adaskaveg helped develop data to validate the efficacy of ManKocide for California tree nuts and says the product has advantages, including ease of use.
It is also highly effective against copper-resistant bacteria in California, Adaskaveg said in an email.
“The product has efficacy against the walnut blight and bacterial spot of almond pathogens and suppresses fire blight on pome fruit and bacterial blast on almond,” he said.
Adaskaveg said he is unaware of other products that have this combination as a premixture,

4-H searches for locals to serve on sponsoring committee
(San Benito Link) Devii Rao, April 14
We are looking for a few local people to serve on a sponsoring committee to keep 4-H active and strong in San Benito County. The sponsoring committee will organize events such as letter writing campaigns, barn dances, dinners, silent and live auctions, fireworks booths, having 4-H youth sell treats at the fair, or your other creative ideas! Sponsoring committee members are not required to have any affiliation with 4-H. We are looking for business leaders and other people who are well connected in the community and who are motivated to provide educational and leadership opportunities to our youth.
California dairies dump milk, crops may be left to wither as coronavirus pandemic disrupts food system
(SF Chronicle) Kurtis Alexander, April 12
…“Everybody's scrambling. The whole food system is scrambling,” said Daniel Sumner, an agricultural economist at UC Davis. “I don't see a big supply-side issue for agriculture. It's really an issue with the food (delivery) system.”
Widespread shutdown order slams California dairy farmers, ‘You can't turn off the cows'
(Sacramento Bee) Michael Finch II, April 10
…“Like every part of the food system, there are complications. The issue for milk is you can't turn off the cows,” said Daniel A. Sumner, an agricultural economist and professor at UC Davis. “What's becoming more of a problem is the slightly longer-term outlook where we have a massive recession (coming).”
Dairy prices are regulated by the federal government and fluctuate on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. So the price of large quantities of milk, cheese, whey and milk powder is set based on data from the prior month, Sumner said.
In January, milk traded at nearly 18 cents per pound and by March the amount fell nearly five cents. Sumner said this suggests there is a price shock to come in the summer.
Grocers Serving Low-Income Neighborhoods Pinched by Shortages, Rising Prices
(KQED) Farida Jhabvala Romero, April 10
…“This hoarding behavior is unfortunate,” said Richard Sexton, a professor of agriculture and resource economics at UC Davis. “We can understand why people do it, but it is what's causing these disruptions.”
… The current shortages could deepen disadvantages for family-owned neighborhood stores, said Sexton, the UC Davis economist.
“The little guys, the small chains of just a few stores, could get the short end of the stick in this situation because food manufacturers and distributors are going to probably prioritize their biggest and best customers,” he said.
Private Grant Will Support New UC California Organic Institute

Scientists Worry Agency Plan to Prevent Fires Could Do Opposite
(Bloomberg) Bobby Magill, April 9
…Controlling wildfire in the region depends on how many firefighters the federal government has on the ground—and they'd have to be in the right place at the right time for the fuels reduction plan to work, said Max Moritz, a wildfire specialist at the University of California, Santa Barbara studying how wildfire affects broad landscapes.
As the climate changes, the effectiveness of fuels reductions projects and fuel breaks begins to fade, he said.
“Climate change seems to be priming the landscape for fires to ignite more easily, spread more easily, to burn hotter and larger—so all of these aspects of climate change would make one suspect that fuel breaks have a harder and harder time doing their job,” Moritz said.
The wildfire program is an “expensive large-scale experiment,” he said.
The real reason we're seeing more wildlife during the pandemic
(Pop Sci) Ula Chrobak, April 9
…In those cases, additional sightings might be due to simple behavior changes. But a less charismatic creature may be also on the rise due to an increased human presence at home. Niamh Quinn, a human-wildlife interactions advisor with the University of California, thinks that rat populations may be increasing in New Orleans and elsewhere. That's because people are cooking, storing, and disposing of at home, drawing rats away from closed restaurants and toward residences.
…Quinn agrees. Late last year, she radio-collared five coyotes in Los Angeles for a research project. She says that her coyotes haven't changed their routines since the shelter-in-place order went into effect, staying in their respective territories, which include areas near

What prompted the author to consider resigning from their job after 16 years
------------correct----------------------
As I shared with my readers earlier in the month, big changes were happening in my life. So, now I am confident I can share these changes with you.
I have worked for a great company over the last 16 years and truly imagined that I would still be at that company when I reached official retirement age(which is still quite a way off). After struggling with several medical issues that cause my body great pain and difficult in walking and moving, I started praying earnestly asking the Lord to lead me and guide me in making the decision to stay or leave.
I know that I made the right decision to resign earlier than planned. I have HIS peace and for the first time realize that having a paycheck isn’t all there is to life. I realize we all have bills to pay and yes, we need money to survive; but when you make budget cuts and rearrange your budget, you can do it. Am I scared? I can confidently say I have no fear. Which if you knew me

What teams are reportedly interested in Jordan Amavi apart from Sevilla
------------correct----------------------
t
In other Spanish-related news, Marca reports that Sevilla have offered 6m Euros for Jordan Amavi, a player who admitted he was looking to leave Villa Park in the summer. Villa who paid around 2m Euros more than that, when signing him, will hope to at least get their money back on any deal.
Other clubs interested in Amavi allegedly include: Monaco, Atletico Madrid and PSG.
Certainly this is one that will hot up in the coming days and Amavi might be one of the first out-going players, when the window opens.
MOMS has recently seen a couple of ‘Glenn Whelan Update’ headline stories on the Birmingham Mail site, yet the stories carried zero actual new information on the situation. It’s still, as is. Villa have reportedly offered £500,000 and Stoke want more for the 33-year-old midfielder. That’s still, the latest!
If there’s one thing MOMS has lamented over the seasons and that’s some Villa fans having revisionist longing for ex-players. Players that they were happy to see leave, but suddenly are considered as the answer to the team’s problems, for no reason other than some goldfish memory sentimentality.
Case in point, Stewart Downing. Villa bought Downing when he was on crutches, still recovering from a broken leg. Villa showed him a lot of good faith in being patient and helping him rehabilitate. Thus, when he went to Liverpool, two years later, after a U-turn of pledging his future to Villa, he was public enemy number one.
Regardless of that, Downing turns 33 next month, making him another older player (along with Whelan and Terry) looking for decent wages, but only offering a short-term solution.
One, or maybe two, of these players is feasible, but it’s dead money, if no promotion is achieved.
In the case of the left-wing position, it’s preferable to give Andre Green the starting berth, as this would be the perfect division to really blood him in and inject Villa with some pace.
Beard Number Two
Wales international Joe Ledley is meant to be on the radar of various Championship clubs, after being released by Crystal Palace. Villa have been mentioned in the mix for the midfielder, but considering the recruitment last season in the midfield department, it doesn’t seem too likely that Ledley would be a priority.
Whilst there are of course Welsh teammates in the Villa set-up to help bend his ear, the reality is the player would prefer to stay in the Premier League, if possible.
